Dear Shareholder: 
On behalf of the Board of Trustees (the "Board" or the "Trustees") of AllianzGI Real Estate Debt Fund (the "Fund"), a series of Allianz Funds Multi-Strategy Trust ("MST" or the "Trust"), we are pleased to invite you to a special meeting of the shareholders of the Fund (the "Meeting") to be held at the offices of Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC ("AllianzGI U.S."), 1633 Broadway, New York, New York, 10019, on January 4, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). 
As discussed in more detail in the accompanying Proxy Statement, you will be asked to approve the following proposal: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amendment to the Fund's fundamental investment restriction with respect to industry concentration.  
[END TABLE]
You will also consider and act upon such other matters as may properly come before the Meeting and any adjourned or postponed session thereof. 
The Board has approved changes to the Fund's name, investment objective and principal investments and strategies to transition the Fund from its current strategy of investing in short duration real estate-related debt instruments to a new strategy of investing in global floating rate notes (the "New Strategy"). Changes related to the New Strategy are expected to go effective on February 1, 2019 and are set forth in Appendix A to the accompanying Proxy Statement. These changes do not require shareholder approval, with the exception of the need to change the Fund's concentration policy. In this context, the Trustees are proposing to modify the Fund's existing concentration policy to reflect the changes in the Fund's investment activity (the "Proposal"). The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1940 Act") require that every registered investment company include in its registration statement a recital of its policy regarding concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries (a "concentration policy"). The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has taken the position that a fund investing more than 25% of its assets in an industry is concentrating in that industry. The Fund currently has a policy to concentrate its investments in the real estate-related sector, meaning that the Fund has adopted a fundamental policy (which may not be changed without shareholder approval) to invest more than 25% of its total assets in the real estate-related sector. In order to allow the Fund to implement the New Strategy, the Trustees are proposing that the shareholders approve a revised concentration policy, under which the Fund will concentrate its investments in the financial services industry. 
Your vote is important 
After considering the matter, the Board unanimously voted to recommend that shareholders of the Fund vote in favor of the Proposal, as more fully described in the accompanying Proxy Statement. Now it is your turn to review the Proposal and vote. For more information about the issue requiring your vote, please refer to the accompanying Proxy Statement. 
No matter how many shares you own, your timely vote is important. If you are not available to attend the Meeting, then please promptly give your voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet by following the instructions on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if you have requested a proxy card by mail, you may vote by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy card in order to avoid the added cost of follow-up solicitations. If you vote by telephone or via the Internet, you will be asked to enter a unique code that has been assigned to you, which is printed on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or your proxy card. This code is designed to confirm your identity, provide access to the voting site and confirm that your instructions are properly recorded. If you have any questions regarding the Proxy Statement, please call at 1-877-361-7967. 
Thank you in advance for your participation in this important vote.

PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 4, 2019 
AllianzGI Real Estate Debt Fund, a series of 
ALLIANZ FUNDS MULTI-STRATEGY TRUST 
1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 
The Board of Trustees (the "Board" or the "Trustees") of AllianzGI Real Estate Debt Fund (the "Fund"), a series of Allianz Funds Multi-Strategy Trust ("MST" or the "Trust"), is soliciting proxies from the shareholders of the Fund in connection with a special meeting of shareholders of the Fund to be held at the offices of Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC ("AllianzGI U.S."), 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019, on January 4, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) and at any adjournments or postponements thereof (collectively, the "Meeting"). The Notice of the Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the proxy card are being made available to shareholders of record as of December 5, 2018 (the "Record Date") beginning on or about December 14, 2018. Upon request and without charge, the Fund will furnish each person to whom this Proxy Statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials is delivered with a copy of the Fund's latest annual and semi-annual report to shareholders. You may obtain copies of one or more reports without charge by calling 1-800-498-5413 (for Institutional Class and Class P Shares), by writing to the Trust at the address appearing above or on the Fund's website at us.allianzgi.com. 
The Meeting is being called for the following purposes: (1) to approve an amendment to the Fund's fundamental investment restriction with respect to industry concentration and (2) to transact such other business as may properly come before the Meeting. 
Section I of this Proxy Statement contains information relating to the Proposal. Section II contains general information about the Trust. Section III contains information about the Meeting and shareholder voting. 
I. APPROVAL OF CHANGE TO THE FUND'S CONCENTRATION POLICY 
The Trustees are proposing to modify the Fund's existing concentration policy to reflect a change in the Fund's investment activity (the "Proposal"). The Trustees have approved changes to the Fund's name, investment objective and principal investments and strategies to transition the Fund from its current strategy of investing in short duration real estate-related debt instruments to a new strategy of investing in global floating rate notes (the "New Strategy"). Changes related to the 
 New Strategy are expected to go effective on February 1, 2019 and are set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. These changes do not require shareholder approval, with the exception of the Proposal. The New Strategy aims to better position the Fund for future growth through investments in a broader asset class. The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1940 Act") require that every registered investment company include in its registration statement a recital of its policy regarding concentration of investments in a particular industry or group of industries (a "concentration policy"). The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has taken the position that a fund investing more than 25% of its assets in an industry is concentrating in that industry. The Fund currently has a policy to concentrate its investments in the real estate-related sector, meaning that the Fund has adopted a fundamental policy (which may not be changed without shareholder approval) to invest more than 25% of its total assets in the real estate-related sector. In order to allow the Fund to implement the New Strategy, the Trustees are proposing that the shareholders approve a revised concentration policy, under which the Fund will instead concentrate its investments in the financial services industry. Pursuant to Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its concentration policy without authorization by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities. 
Under the 1940 Act, an investment company may not concentrate its investments in any industry or group of industries unless it does so pursuant to a fundamental policy that can only be changed with shareholder approval. In addition, the investment company must concentrate its investments consistent with any policy to do so. Although "concentration" is not defined in the 1940 Act, the SEC has generally followed the 25% test described above for determining what constitutes "concentration". 
The proposed amended fundamental investment restriction is as follows: 
The Fund may not invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in the securities of companies primarily engaged in any one industry, except that it will concentrate more than 25% of its total assets in the financial services industry. 
The relevant disclosure in the Fund's statement of additional information will also be revised to include language substantially similar to the following paragraph, which will specify the meaning of "financial services industry": 
The Fund currently considers the financial services industry to include banks, investment managers, brokerage firms, investment banks, insurance companies and other companies that provide comparable financial services to consumers or industry.  The current fundamental restriction of the Fund with respect to concentrating investments in an industry is as follows: 
The Fund may not invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in the securities of companies primarily engaged in any one industry, except that it will concentrate more than 25% of its total assets in the real estate-related sector. 
The relevant disclosure in the Fund's statement of additional information specifies the meaning of "real estate-related sector": 
With respect to the Fund's fundamental investment policy relating to industry concentration, the Fund currently considers the real estate-related sector to include issuers of real estate-related securities. The Fund considers "real estate-related securities" to include, without limitation, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, debt and equity securities (including preferred shares) issued by real estate investment trusts and other debt and equity securities of issuers that are principally engaged in the ownership, construction, development, financing, management, servicing, sale and/or leasing of commercial, industrial and/or residential real estate. The specific securities that the Fund may from time to time consider to qualify as "real estate-related securities" will change as markets, technologies and investment practices develop. 
The Board recommends that the Fund's current fundamental investment restriction with respect to concentrating investments in an industry be amended as proposed. 
Required Vote 
The Proposal requires a vote by the shareholders of the Fund. Approval of the Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, which means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (A) 67% or more of the outstanding shares present or represented by proxy at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (B) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. 
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL.

 III. VOTING INFORMATION 
Record Date, Quorum and Methods of Tabulation 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. The holders of 30% of the shares of the Fund outstanding as of the Record Date, present in person or represented by proxy, constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the shareholders of the Fund at the Meeting. 
Each whole share shall be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to vote and each fractional share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. Shares represented by timely, duly executed proxies will be voted as you instruct. If no specification is made, shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Trustees. Proxies may be revoked at any time before they are exercised by sending a written revocation which is received by the Secretary of the applicable Trust prior to any such exercise, by properly executing a later-dated proxy, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be counted by persons appointed by the Fund as tellers both for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum and for calculating the votes cast on the issues before the Meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., proxies representing shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have the discretionary voting power on a particular matter) will be counted for quorum purposes. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the Proposal. 
Adjournments 
In the event that a quorum is not present for purposes of acting on the Proposal for the Fund, or if sufficient votes in favor of the Proposal are not received by the time of the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of the Fund present in person or represented by proxy at the session of the Meeting to be adjourned. The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of the Proposal. They will vote against such adjournment those proxies required to be voted against the Proposal and will not vote any proxies that direct them to abstain from voting on the Proposal. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
The solicitation of proxies by personal interview, mail and telephone may be made by officers and Trustees of the Fund and officers and employees of AllianzGI U.S., its affiliates and other representatives of the Fund. The Trust has retained   American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC ("AST") to aid in the solicitation of proxies (which is estimated to cost approximately $50,000 (including legal fees)) and this cost as well as the audit and other costs of preparing, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement and the cost of holding the Meeting (including the costs of any additional solicitation and any adjourned session) for the Fund will be borne by AllianzGI U.S. 
Methods of Voting 
Electronic Voting: You may give your voting instructions via the Internet or by touch-tone telephone by following the instructions found on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or on the proxy card. 
Telephone Voting: You may give your voting instructions over the telephone by following the instructions found on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or calling the phone number listed on your proxy card. When receiving your instructions by telephone, the representative may ask you for your full name and address to confirm that you have received the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail. If the information you provide matches the information provided to AST by the Trust, then a representative can record your instructions over the phone. 
As the Meeting date approaches, you may receive a call from a representative of the Trust, AllianzGI U.S. or its affiliates if the Trust has not yet received your vote. 
Voting by Mail: If you wish to participate in the Meeting, but do not wish to give a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, you can request a copy of a full set of Proxy Materials which includes a proxy card and then complete, sign and mail the proxy card received with the Proxy Statement by following the instructions on the proxy card, or you can attend the Meeting in person. 
Shareholder Proposals at Future Meetings 
Under the Declaration of Trust, the Trust is not required to hold annual meetings of Trust shareholders. Except as described below, it is not anticipated that the Trust will hold shareholders' meetings unless required by law or its Declaration of Trust. In this regard, the Trust will be required to hold a meeting to elect Trustees to fill any existing vacancies on the Board if, at any time, fewer than a majority of the Trustees have been elected by the shareholders of the Trust. Shareholder proposals to be presented at any future meeting of shareholders of the Trust must be received by the Trust a reasonable time before that meeting in order for such proposals to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials relating to that meeting. Any such proposals should be submitted to the attention of the Board, c/o Secretary, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019.  Other Matters 
Although the Meeting has been called to transact any other business that may properly come before it, the only business that management intends to present or that it knows that others will present is the Proposal. If any other matters properly come before the Meeting, the persons named in properly executed proxies have discretionary authority to vote such proxies as they shall decide. 
Only one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials may be mailed to a household, even if more than one person in a household is a Fund shareholder of record, unless the Fund has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. If you need additional copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and you are a holder of record of your shares, please call 1-877-361-7967. If your shares are held in broker street name, please contact your financial service firm to obtain additional copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Additional copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will be delivered promptly upon request. If in the future you do not want the mailing of notices of internet availability of proxy materials, proxy statements and information statements to be combined with those of other members of your household, or if you have received multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and want future mailings to be combined with those of other members of your household, please contact AST in writing at American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, C/O Data Entry Department, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219-9877, or by telephone at 1-800-498-5413 (for Institutional Class and Class P), or contact your financial service firm.

The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in floating rate notes. The Fund currently defines floating rate notes to include floating rate debt securities and floating rate structured or securitized products (including certain mortgage- and asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations). The Fund may also invest in fixed-rate debt with respect to which the Fund has entered into derivative instruments to effectively convert the fixed-rate interest payments into floating or adjustable rate interest payments. The Fund's investments in derivatives and other synthetic instruments that have economic characteristics similar, in the judgment of the Manager, to floating rate notes will be counted toward satisfaction of the Fund's 80% investment policy described above. Floating rate notes are typically debt obligations with coupon rates that adjust or "float" periodically, often on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis by reference to a base lending rate (such as LIBOR) plus a premium. Floating rate notes may be unsecured obligations of the borrower. 
The securities and instruments in which the Fund may invest may be denominated in non-U.S. currencies or the U.S. dollar. The Fund may invest in debt securities issued by U.S and non-U.S. corporations, banks, supranational entities, municipalities, development banks, agencies and governments. In addition, the Fund may invest in asset-backed securities ("ABS"), mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") issued by U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to invest less than 40% of its net assets in non-U.S. securities, which may include emerging markets securities. The Fund typically seeks to hedge most or all of its exposure to securities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies.

AllianzGI Floating Rate Note Fund (continued) 
The Fund will ordinarily not make investments into high yield securities rated below "B-," nor will it invest in defaulted securities. Securities rated below investment grade (or unrated bonds deemed by the Manager to be of comparable quality) are referred to as high yield or "junk bonds." The Fund expects that, under normal circumstances, it will invest less than 35% of its net assets, at the time of purchase, in securities that are rated below investment grade. 
The Manager expects that the Fund's average portfolio duration typically will vary from 0 to 1 year. The portfolio managers may consider selling a particular security if they anticipate a deterioration in credit quality in the sector, jurisdiction or specific issuer and/or security, if they perceive a decline in relative attractiveness as compared to other issuers or securities or they identify material changes in the factors underlying the original reasons for purchase. 
The Fund may also invest a portion of its assets in money market instruments, as well as other investment companies, including open-end or closed-end investment companies and domestic or foreign private investment vehicles, including investment companies sponsored by the Manager and its affiliates. 
The Fund may utilize various derivative instruments for hedging or efficient portfolio management purposes, to manage the Fund's portfolio duration or currency exposure, to manage the Fund's interest rate exposure, or for investment purposes. The Fund may utilize derivatives of all types and may invest in, without limitation, Treasury futures, options on Treasury futures, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, total return swaps, equity futures, and credit default swap indices. The Fund may invest in currency-related transactions, such as forward transactions (including deliverable and non-deliverable forwards), currency futures transactions and currency options transactions, in each case for hedging or other investment purposes. 
In response to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the Fund may deviate from its principal strategies by making temporary investments of some or all of its assets in high-quality fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents. The Fund may not achieve its investment objective when it does so.
