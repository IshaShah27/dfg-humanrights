 Compensation Element   Objectives   Key Characteristics  
 Base Salary   To provide a fixed amount for performing the duties and responsibilities of the position   Determined based on overall performance, level of responsibility, pay grade, competitive compensation data, and comparison to our other executives        
 Annual Incentive Cash Bonus   To motivate executive officers to achieve Company-wide and individual performance goals• 80% of bonus opportunity based on financial objectives, 20% based on individual strategic objectives  
• Financial objectives and targets aligned with business strategy to grow revenue and increase margins  
• Annual cash bonus payout range of 0-200%         
 PSU Awards   To motivate executive officers to achieve certain longer-term goals and create long-term alignment with stockholders• PSUs represent 70% of long-term incentive grant value  
• Granted annually (with the exception of the fiscal 2018 pull-forward awards granted in fiscal 2017) based on pay grades and individual performance  
• Based on a three-year performance period  
• Performance metrics are aligned with the business transformation plan; fiscal 2018 pull forward award performance is measured against (i) adjusted EBITDA margin during fiscal 2018 (weighted 1∕3), and (ii) adjusted EBITDA growth during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 (weighted 2∕3)  
• For the three-year performance period, our TSR will be compared to a selected peer group of companies in similar GICS codes as CDK, which can adjust the PSU award (upward and downward) and thereby focus executives to drive long-term value to stockholders  
• If our compounded annual revenue growth is below 3% for the respective three-year performance period, final awards cannot exceed 100% of target  
• PSUs have a payout range of 0-250% of target, including the TSR modifier

• Grants vest in equal installments over four years (fiscal 2018 pull-forward stock option grant vests on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date)

 PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The compensation committee considered the risks presented by our compensation policies and practices at its meeting held in September 2018 and believes that our policies and practices of compensating employees do not, in the context of our business and our strategy, encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking for the following reasons:  
• Our incentive plans have diverse performance measures with rigorous goals, including our financial measures and our business unit financial measures, operational measures, and individual measures;  
• Our compensation programs balance annual and long-term incentive opportunities;  
• We cap incentive plan payouts within a reasonable range;  
• The mix of PSUs and stock options in our long-term incentive programs serves the best interests of our stockholders and us; and  
• Our stock ownership guidelines link the interests of our executive officers to those of our stockholders.

 Q:   Who may vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A:   Holders of our common stock at the close of business on September 14, 2018 (the "Record Date") may vote at the Annual Meeting. We refer to the holders of our common stock as "stockholders" throughout this proxy statement. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held as of the Record Date.         Stockholders at the close of business on the Record Date may examine a list of all stockholders as of the Record Date for any purpose germane to the Annual Meeting for 10 days preceding the Annual Meeting, at our offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and electronically during the Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CDK2018 when you enter the 16-digit control number we have provided to you.

 Q:   What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A:   Stockholders of Record. You are a stockholder of record or registered stockholder if, at the close of business on the Record Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with EQ Shareowner Services, our transfer agent.         Beneficial Owner. You are a beneficial owner if, at the close of business on the Record Date, your shares were held by a brokerage firm or other nominee and not in your name. Being a beneficial owner means that, like most of our stockholders, your shares are held in "street name." As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or nominee how to vote your shares by following the voting instructions your broker or other nominee provides. If you do not provide your broker or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares, your broker or nominee will be able to vote your shares with respect to some of the proposals in this proxy statement, but not all. Please see the section titled What if I submit a proxy, but do not specify how my shares are to be voted? for additional information.

 Q:   What is the effect of a broker non-vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A:   Brokers or other nominees who hold shares of our common stock for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on routine proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least 10 days prior to the Annual Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares.          Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, but will not be counted as votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Therefore, a broker non-vote will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum and will not otherwise affect the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q:   How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A:   We need a quorum of stockholders to hold the Annual Meeting. A quorum exists when at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the close of business on the Record Date is represented at the Annual Meeting either in person via the Internet or by proxy. On September 14, 2018, there were 128,940,444 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote (including 189,548 shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock granted pursuant to the 2014 Plan that are entitled to vote).         Your shares will be counted towards the quorum if you vote by mail, by telephone, or via the Internet either before or during the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes also will count towards the quorum requirement. If a quorum is not met, a majority of the shares present at the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later date.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A:   Stockholders of Record. Our stockholders have the opportunity to confirm that their vote was cast in accordance with their instructions. Vote confirmation is consistent with our commitment to sound corporate governance standards and an important means to increase transparency. Vote confirmation is available 24 hours after your vote is received beginning on October 31, 2018, with the final vote tabulation available through January 14, 2019. You may confirm your vote whether it was cast by proxy card, electronically or telephonically.

If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage account, we are unable to distinguish between your vote and that of another stockholder beneficially holding shares through the same bank or broker, therefore the confirmation will not confirm whether your bank or broker allocated the correct number of shares to you.

 Q:   What is "householding?"  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A:   To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to stockholders who may have more than one account holding our stock but share the same address, we have adopted a procedure known as "householding." Under this procedure, certain stockholders of record who have the same address and last name, and who do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials, will receive only one copy of our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and, as applicable, any additional proxy materials that are delivered until such time as one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they want to receive separate copies. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to have access to and utilize separate proxy voting instructions.         If you are a registered stockholder and choose to have separate copies of our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K mailed to you, you must "opt-out" by writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York, 11717 or by calling 1-800-542-1061, and we will cease householding all such disclosure documents within 30 days. If we do not receive instructions to remove your accounts from this service, your accounts will continue to be "householded" until we notify you otherwise. If you hold your shares through a bank or brokerage account, information regarding householding of disclosure documents should have been forwarded to you by your bank or broker.         You can also contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at 1-800-542-1061 if you received multiple copies of the Annual Meeting materials and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future.
