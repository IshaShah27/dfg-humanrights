PROXY STATEMENT 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 16, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Fund"), to be used at the Ninth Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held at The Marquette Hotel, 710 S. Marquette Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, on April 16, 2019 at 9:30 a.m., local time. It is expected that the Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and form of Proxy will first be mailed to Stockholders on or about March 6, 2019. 
If you properly authorize your proxy by the Internet or telephonically or by executing and returning the enclosed Proxy Card, and your proxy is not subsequently revoked, your votes will be cast at the Meeting, and any postponement or adjournment thereof. If you give instructions, your votes will be cast in accordance with your instructions. If you return your signed Proxy Card without instructions, your votes will be cast (i) FOR the election of the three Directors named in Proposal 1 and (ii) FOR the ratification of the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund (Proposal 2). Your votes will be cast in the discretion of the Proxy holders on any other matter that may properly have come before the Meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof, including, but not limited to, proposing and/or voting on the adjournment or postponement of the Meeting with respect to one or more Board proposals in the event that sufficient votes in favor of any Board proposal are not received. If you execute, date and submit a proxy card that is received by the Fund prior to the Meeting, you may revoke that proxy or change it by written notice to the Fund (Attention: Secretary) by submitting a subsequently executed and dated proxy card, by authorizing your proxy by telephone or Internet on a later date or by attending the Meeting and casting your vote in person. If you authorize your proxy by telephone or through the Internet, you may revoke it by authorizing a subsequent proxy by telephone or Internet, by completing, signing and returning a proxy card dated as of a date that is later than your last telephone or Internet proxy authorization or by attending the Meeting and casting your vote in person. Attending the Meeting will not automatically revoke your prior proxy. 
The close of business on February 26, 2019 has been fixed as the record date for the determination of Stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. On that date, the Fund had outstanding 15,877,143.000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), each share being entitled to one vote. For all matters to be voted upon, an abstention or broker non-vote will not be considered a vote cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. For purposes of the vote on the election of each nominee for Director (Proposal 1), abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, with respect to a Director will have the same effect as a vote against that Director. For purposes of the vote on ratification of the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2), abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the result of the vote. 
The presence in person or by proxy of Stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting shall constitute a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting or, even if a quorum is so present, in the event that sufficient votes in favor of any Board proposal (including the election of each of the Board's nominees for Director) are not received and tabulated prior to the time the Meeting is called   to order, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting with no notice other than an announcement at the Meeting and further solicitation may be made with respect to such Board proposal. If a vote to adjourn the Meeting with respect to one or more of the Board's proposals is called, the votes of Stockholders indicating a vote for, or not providing instructions with respect to, a Board proposal in their Proxies will be cast for adjournment with respect to that proposal and votes of Stockholders indicating a vote against such a Board proposal will be cast against adjournment with respect to that proposal. 
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC ("Columbia Management" or the "Manager"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial"), is the investment manager of the Fund. Columbia Management is also responsible for overseeing the administrative operations of the Fund, including the general supervision of the Fund's operations, the coordination of the Fund's service providers and the provision of related clerical and administrative services to the Fund. Columbia Management is located at 225 Franklin Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, and Ameriprise Financial is located at 1099 Ameriprise Financial Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474. 
The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its most recent annual report and most recent semi-annual report to any Stockholder upon request by calling 1-800-937-5449. 
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC ("AST") is the Fund's transfer agent, registrar, dividend disbursing and paying agent and stockholder servicing agent. AST is located at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219. If you have elected to receive one Proxy Statement for all accounts maintained by members of your household and such accounts are held directly with AST, AST will deliver promptly upon written request to AST at the address provided in the preceding sentence, a separate copy of the Proxy Statement for a separate account. If you are currently receiving multiple copies of the Proxy Statement and wish, in the future, to receive only one copy for all accounts maintained by members of your household and your accounts are held directly with AST, please contact AST. If you maintain your Fund account through a financial intermediary and wish to make a change to the number of Proxy Statements received by you and members of your household, you must contact that financial intermediary. 
Proposal 1 
Election of Directors 
The Fund's Stockholders elect members of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") that oversee the Fund's operations. The Board is presently comprised of eight Directors. Under the current Board policy, Directors not affiliated with the Manager generally serve through the end of the calendar year in which they reach the mandatory retirement age established by the Board. The Board is divided into three classes, two of which currently consist of three Directors and one of which currently consists of two Directors. Members of each class hold office for a term of three years and until their successors are elected and qualify. The term of one class expires each year. 
At the Meeting, three Directors are proposed to be elected. Ms. Minor M. Shaw and Messrs. Anthony M. Santomero and William F. Truscott have been unanimously recommended by the Board Governance Committee of the Board and by the Board for election to their class until the expiration of their term (2022), and when their successors are elected and qualify. 
If you return your signed Proxy Card without instructions, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of Proxy to nominate and to cast your votes for the election of each of Ms. Shaw and Messrs. Santomero and Truscott. Ms. Shaw and Mr. Truscott were last elected by Stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting. Each of Ms. Shaw's and Mr. Truscott's current term will expire at this Annual Meeting. Mr. Santomero was unanimously nominated by the Board to serve on the Board upon his election by stockholders at the Annual Meeting, to fill the seat vacated by Mr. William P. Carmichael due to his retirement   from the Board on December 31, 2018. While Mr. Santomero, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, would be deemed to be an "interested person" (as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act")) of the Fund because he serves on the boards of Citigroup, Inc. and Citibank N.A., Mr. Santomero is retiring from his service on the boards of Citigroup, Inc. and Citibank N.A. effective April 1, 2019, and, upon such retirement, he would no longer be deemed to be an "interested person" of the Fund. Instead, if elected to the Fund's Board on April 16, 2019, Mr. Santomero would, then having no board membership on Citigroup, Inc. or Citibank N.A., serve the Fund as a "non-interested person" (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund (an "Independent Director"). Each nominee has agreed to serve or continue to serve if elected. There is no reason to believe that any of the nominees will become unavailable for election as a Director of the Fund, but if that should occur before the Meeting, votes will be cast for the persons the Board Governance Committee and the Board recommend. Mr. Santomero has served as a Trustee on the boards of the mutual funds within the Columbia Funds Complex since 2008 and, as such, has substantial knowledge of and familiarity with, among other things, fund board responsibilities and the Manager and its affiliates that provide services to the Fund. 
Background information regarding Ms. Shaw and Messrs. Santomero and Truscott, as well as the Directors of the Fund not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting, follows. Each existing member, except Mr. Truscott, currently oversees 124 portfolios in the Columbia Funds Complex managed by Columbia Management, including the Fund. Mr. Truscott oversees 193 portfolios. Director-Nominee Mr. Santomero currently oversees 122 portfolios in the Columbia Funds Complex.

While Mr. Santomero, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, would be deemed to be an "interested person" (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund because he serves on the boards of Citigroup, Inc. and Citibank  N.A., Mr. Santomero is retiring from his service on the boards of Citigroup, Inc. and Citibank N.A. effective April 1, 2019 and, upon such retirement, he would no longer be deemed to be an "interested person" of the Fund.  Instead, if elected to the Fund's Board on April 16, 2019, Mr. Santomero would, then having no board membership on Citigroup, Inc. or Citibank N.A., serve the Fund as an Independent Director.  
(c)  Ms. Shaw invested in a Section 529 Plan managed by the Manager that allocates assets to various open-end funds, including Columbia Funds. The amount shown includes the value of her interest in this plan determined as if her investment in the plan were invested directly in the Columbia Funds pursuant to the  plan's target allocations.  
[END TABLE]
As of December 31, 2018, the Directors and officers of the Fund as a group beneficially owned less than 1% of the Fund's Common Stock. 
Responsibilities of Board with respect to Management of the Fund 
The Board is chaired by an Independent Director who has significant additional responsibilities compared to the other Board members, including, among other things: setting the agenda for Board meetings, communicating and meeting regularly with Board members between Board and committee meetings on Fund-related matters, with the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"), counsel to the Independent Directors, and representatives of the Fund's service providers. 
The Board initially approves an investment management services agreement and other contracts with the Manager and its affiliates, and other service providers. Once the contracts are approved, the Board monitors the level and quality of services including commitments of service providers to achieve expected levels of investment performance and stockholder services. Annually, the Board evaluates the services received under the   contracts by reviewing, among other things, reports covering investment performance, stockholder services, marketing, and the Manager's profitability in order to determine whether to continue existing contracts or negotiate new contracts. The Manager is responsible for day-to-day management and administration of the Fund and management of the risks that arise from the Fund's investments and operations. The Board's oversight of the Manager and other service providers in the operation of the Fund includes oversight with respect to various risk management functions. The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, and valuation risks, among others. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the Manager and other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk) who carry out the Fund's investment management and business affairs. Each of the Manager and other service providers has its own, independent interest in risk management, and its policies and methods of carrying out risk management functions will depend, in part, on its analysis of the risks, functions and business models. 
Risk oversight forms part of the Board's general oversight of the Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and Committee activities. As part of its regular oversight of the Fund, the Board, directly or through a committee, interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, the Manager, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund, and internal auditors for the Manager or its affiliates, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and relevant risk functions. The Board also meets periodically with the Fund's CCO, to receive reports regarding the adequacy of the policies and procedures of the Fund and certain service providers and their effectiveness of their implementation. The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Review Committee, reviews investment policies in connection with its review of the Fund's performance, and meets periodically with the portfolio managers of the Fund to receive reports regarding the management of the Fund, including various investment risks. As part of the Board's periodic review of the Fund's advisory and other service provider agreements, as applicable, the Board may consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible. In addition, the Board oversees processes that are in place addressing compliance with applicable rules, regulations and investment policies and addresses possible conflicts of interest. The Board met seven times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Board oversees the Fund's liquidity risk through, among other things, receiving periodic reporting and presentations by investment and other personnel of the Manager. Additionally, as required by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act, the Fund implemented certain portions of a written liquidity risk management program and related procedures ("Liquidity Program"), which is reasonably designed to assess and manage the Fund's liquidity risk. The Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the designation of a liquidity risk management program administrator (the "Liquidity Program Administrator") who is responsible for administering the Liquidity Program. The Board will review, no less frequently than annually, a written report prepared by the Liquidity Program Administrator that addresses the operation of the Liquidity Program and assesses its adequacy and effectiveness of implementation. 
The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified in advance; that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks; that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as various investment-related risks) in seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objectives; and that the processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's risk management oversight is subject to substantial limitations. 
Director and Nominee Biographical Information and Qualifications 
The following provides an overview of the considerations that led the Board to conclude that each individual nominated or serving as a Director should so serve. Generally, no one factor was decisive in the selection of an individual to join the Board. Among the factors the Board considered when concluding that an individual should serve on the Board were the following: (i) the individual's business and professional experience and accomplishments; (ii) the individual's ability to work effectively with the other Directors; (iii) the individual's prior experience, if any, serving on the boards of public companies (including, where relevant, other investment companies) and other enterprises and organizations; and (iv) how the individual's skills, experience and attributes would contribute to an appropriate mix of relevant skills and experience on the Board.  In respect of each current Director and Nominee, the individual's substantial professional accomplishments and experience were a significant factor in the determination that, in light of the business and structure of the Fund, the individual should serve as a Director.

(the distributor of the open-end funds (other than the Columbia ETFs) in the Columbia Funds Complex) since May 2010 and since February 2012 has served as its Chief Executive Officer. The Board has concluded that having a senior member of the Manager serve on the Board can facilitate increased access to information regarding the Manager for the independent Directors, which is the Fund's most significant service provider. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has organized the following standing committees to facilitate its work: Board Governance Committee, Compliance Committee, Contracts Committee, Executive Committee, Investment Review Committee and Audit Committee. These Committees are comprised solely of independent Directors. The table above providing background on each Director also includes their respective committee assignments. The duties of these committees are described below. 
Mr. Boudreau, as Chair of the Board, acts as a point of contact between the independent Directors and the Manager between Board meetings in respect of general matters. 
Board Governance Committee.    Recommends to the Board the size, structure and composition of the Board and its committees; the compensation to be paid to members of the Board; and a process for evaluating the   Board's performance. The committee also reviews candidates for Board membership, including candidates recommended by Stockholders. The committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding responsibilities and duties of the Board, oversees proxy voting and supports the work of the Board Chair in relation to furthering the interests of the Fund and other funds in the Columbia Funds Complex overseen by the Board and their shareholders. 
To be considered as a candidate for Director, recommendations must include a curriculum vitae and be mailed to Edward J. Boudreau, Jr., Chair of the Board, Columbia Funds Complex, 225 Franklin Street, Mail Drop BX 32-05228, Boston, MA 02110. To be timely for consideration by the committee, the submission, including all required information, must be submitted in writing not less than 120 days before the date of the proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting of Stockholders. The committee will consider only one candidate submitted by such a Stockholder or group for nomination for election at a meeting of Stockholders. The committee will not consider self-nominated candidates or candidates nominated by members of a candidate's family, including such candidate's spouse, children, parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents, nieces and nephews. Stockholders who wish to submit a candidate for nomination directly to the Fund's Stockholders must follow the procedures described in the Fund's Bylaws, as posted to the website columbiathreadneedleus.com. 
The committee will consider and evaluate candidates submitted by the nominating Stockholder or group on the basis of the same criteria as those used to consider and evaluate candidates submitted from other sources. The committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering director candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) the candidate's knowledge in matters relating to the investment company industry; (ii) any experience possessed by the candidate as a director or senior officer of other public or private companies; (iii) the candidate's educational background; (iv) the candidate's reputation for high ethical standards and personal and professional integrity; (v) any specific financial, technical or other expertise possessed by the candidate, and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board's existing mix of skills and qualifications; (vi) the candidate's perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the Board, including the candidate's ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly, work collaboratively with other members of the Board and carry out his or her duties in the best interests of the Fund; (vii) the candidate's ability to qualify as an independent director; and (viii) such other criteria as the committee determines to be relevant in light of the existing composition of the Board and any anticipated vacancies or other factors. 
Members of the committee (and/or the Board) also meet personally with each nominee to evaluate the candidate's ability to work effectively with other members of the Board, while also exercising independent judgment. Although the Board does not have a formal diversity policy, the Board endeavors to comprise itself of members with a broad mix of professional and personal backgrounds. Thus, the committee and the Board accorded particular weight to the individual professional background of each independent Director. The committee held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Compliance Committee.    Supports the Fund's maintenance of a strong compliance program by providing a forum for independent Directors to consider compliance matters impacting the Fund or its key service providers; developing and implementing, in coordination with the CCO, a process for the review and consideration of compliance reports that are provided to the Board; and providing a designated forum for the Fund's CCO to meet with independent Directors on a regular basis to discuss compliance matters. The committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Contracts Committee.    Reviews and oversees the contractual relationships with service providers. Receives and analyzes reports covering the level and quality of services provided under contracts with the Fund and advises the Board regarding actions taken on these contracts during the annual review process. Reviews and considers, on behalf of all Directors, the Fund's management contract to assist the Directors in fulfilling their responsibilities relating to the Board's evaluation and consideration of these arrangements. The committee held six meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  Executive Committee.    Acts, as needed, for the Board between meetings of the Board, and can meet in advance of, and/or for planning, regularly scheduled meetings or other Board matters. The committee held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Investment Review Committee.    Reviews and oversees the management of the Fund's assets. Considers investment management policies and strategies; investment performance; risk management techniques; and securities trading practices and reports any concerns to the Board. The committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Audit Committee.    Oversees the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Fund and its internal controls over financial reporting. Oversees the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statements and independent audits as well as the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the Fund's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls over financial reporting and independent audits. The committee also makes recommendations regarding the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm (i.e., independent auditors) and reviews and evaluates the qualifications, independence and performance of the auditor. The committee oversees the Fund's risks by, among other things, meeting with the Fund's internal auditors, establishing procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns about accounting or audit matters, and overseeing the Fund's Disclosure Controls and Procedures. This committee acts as a liaison between the independent auditors and the full Board and must prepare an audit committee report. This committee operates pursuant to a written charter, a copy of which is available at columbiathreadneedleus.com. The members of this committee are "independent" as required by applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The report of the Audit Committee, as approved by the Board on February 19, 2019, is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix 1. The committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Procedures for Communications to the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors has adopted a process for Stockholders to send communications to the Board. To communicate with the Board of Directors or an individual Director, a Stockholder must send written communications to Columbia Funds Complex, 225 Franklin Street, Mail Drop BX 32-05228, Boston, MA 02110, addressed to the Board of Directors or, as the case may be, an individual Director.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)   For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were 124 portfolios in the Columbia Funds Complex, including  the Fund, overseen by the Directors, except for Mr. Santomero, who oversaw 122 portfolios.  
(b)   Mr. Boudreau, Ms. Carlton, Ms. Paglia, and Ms. Shaw elected to defer a portion of the total  compensation from the Fund payable during the period in the amount of $2,171, $665, $3,745 and $1,663, respectively. The compensation figures reported in the table above include these deferred amounts.  
(c)   Mr. Carmichael served as a Director until December 31, 2018, and stopped receiving compensation from  the Fund and the Columbia Funds Complex as of such date.  
(d)   Mr. Santomero will, if and upon election at the Annual Meeting, become a Director of the Fund effective  April 16, 2019 and, as such, will receive no compensation from the Fund prior to such date. Prior to April 16, 2019, Mr. Santomero has served as a trustee to certain open-end funds in the  Columbia Funds Complex.  
[END TABLE]
No compensation is paid by the Fund or other funds in the Columbia Funds Complex to Directors or officers of the Fund or other funds in the Columbia Funds Complex, as applicable, who are employees or officers of the Manager or its affiliates. 
The independent Board members determine the amount of compensation that they receive, including the amount paid to the Chairman of the Board. In determining compensation for the independent Board members, the independent Board members take into account a variety of factors including, among other things, their collective significant work experience (e.g., in business and finance, government or academia). The independent Board members also recognize that these individuals' advice and counsel are in demand by other organizations, that these individuals may reject other opportunities because of the demands of their duties as independent Board members, and that they undertake significant legal responsibilities. The independent Board members also consider the compensation paid to independent board members of other fund complexes of comparable size and, in doing so, they seek to set their compensation from the Columbia Funds Complex at a level that approximates   or is lower than the median level of compensation paid by such other comparable complexes. In determining the compensation paid to the Chairman, the independent Board members take into account, among other things, the Chairman's significant additional responsibilities (e.g., setting the agenda for Board meetings, communicating or meeting regularly with the Fund's CCO, counsel to the independent Board members, and the Fund's service providers), which result in a significantly greater time commitment required of the Chairman. The Chairman's compensation, therefore, has generally been set at a higher level than the other independent Board members. 
The independent Board members, other than the Board Chairman, are paid an annual retainer of $225,000 with respect to all funds in the Columbia Funds Complex overseen by them, $10,000 of which is allocated from the Fund and one other closed-end fund (collectively, the "Closed-End Funds") based, in part, on the relative assets of the Closed-End Funds. The independent Directors also receive the following compensation from funds in the Columbia Funds Complex other than the Closed-End Funds: committee Chairs each receive an additional annual retainer of $30,000 and sub-committee chairs each receive an additional annual retainer of $5,000. In addition, independent Board members are paid the following fees for attending Board and committee meetings: $5,000 per day for in-person Board meetings and $2,500 per day for in-person committee or sub-committee meetings (if such meetings are not held on the same day as a Board meeting). Independent Board members are not paid for special meetings conducted by telephone. The Board's Chairman will receive total annual cash compensation of $445,000, of which $10,000 is allocated from the Closed-End Funds. 
The independent Board members may elect to defer payment of up to 100% of the compensation they receive in accordance with a Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Plan"). Under the Deferred Plan, a Board member may elect to have his or her deferred compensation treated as if it had been invested in shares of one or more eligible funds in the Columbia Funds Complex, and the amount paid to the Board member under the Deferred Plan will be determined based on the performance of such investments. Distributions may be taken in a lump sum or over a period of years. The Deferred Plan will remain unfunded for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is anticipated that deferral of Board member compensation in accordance with the Deferred Plan will have, at most, a negligible impact on the Fund's assets and liabilities. 
The Fund's Bylaws require each Director to be elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of a Director. 
Your Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that the Stockholders Vote 
FOR 
the Election of Each of the Nominees to Serve as Director of the Fund. 
Proposal 2 
Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
At the Board meeting held January 28th-30th, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors recommended and the Board of Directors, including a majority of those members who are not "interested persons" of the Fund (as defined in the 1940 Act), approved PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the independent registered public accounting firm to serve as auditors of the Fund for 2019. PwC began service as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm effective in the third quarter of 2012. 
Neither the Fund's Charter nor its Bylaws require that Stockholders ratify the selection of PwC as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. The Board of Directors is submitting this matter to the Stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If the Stockholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee of the Board will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC, but may determine to nonetheless continue to retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee and the Board in their discretion may change the selection at any time during the year if they determine that such change would be in the best interests of the   Fund. If no other instructions are provided, it is intended that the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PwC. A representative of PwC will be in attendance at the Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate questions. 
As the Fund's independent accountant, PwC must meet regulatory requirements relating to independence, including the SEC's auditor independence rules which prohibit accounting firms from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities. Specifically, as interpreted by SEC staff, under Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (the Loan Rule), an accounting firm would not be considered independent if it receives a loan from a lender or an affiliate of a lender that is a "record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities." PwC has advised the Audit Committee of the Board that PwC and certain of its affiliates have loans from lenders who are also record owners of more than 10% of the shares issued by several funds in the Columbia Funds Complex or certain other entities within the Ameriprise Financial investment company complex; however, management is not aware of any such lenders having an ownership interest in the Fund of more than 10% of its outstanding shares. 
On June 20, 2016, the SEC staff issued a "no-action" letter (the First Loan Rule No-Action Letter) confirming that it would not recommend that the SEC commence enforcement action against a fund that continues to fulfill its regulatory requirements under the federal securities laws by using audit services performed by an audit firm that is not in compliance with the Loan Rule, provided that: (1) the audit firm has complied with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Rule 3526(b)(1) and 3526(b)(2) or, with respect to any fund or entity to which Rule 3526 does not apply, has provided substantially equivalent communications; (2) the audit firm's non-compliance under the Loan Rule is limited to certain lending relationships; and (3) notwithstanding such non-compliance, the audit firm has concluded that it is objective and impartial with respect to the issues encompassed within its engagement. Although the First Loan Rule No-Action Letter was issued to one fund complex, it is generally available to other fund complexes. On September 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued a second "no-action" letter (together with the First Loan Rule No-Action Letter, the "Loan Rule No-Action Letter") extending the relief under the Loan Rule No-Action Letter indefinitely. On May 2, 2018, the SEC proposed amendments to the Loan Rule, which, if adopted as proposed, would refocus the analysis that must be conducted to determine whether an auditor is independent when the auditor has a lending relationship with certain shareholders of an audit client at any time during an audit or professional engagement period. 
After evaluating the facts and circumstances related to the Loan Rule and PwC's lending relationships, PwC advised the Audit Committee of the Board that (1) PwC is independent with respect to the Fund, within the meaning of PCAOB Rule 3520, (2) PwC has concluded that it is objective and impartial with respect to the issues encompassed within its engagement, including the audit of the Fund's financial statements, and (3) PwC believes that it can continue to serve as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, based on its knowledge and analyses of the facts and circumstances, PwC has confirmed that it is not aware of any facts that would preclude reliance by the Fund on the Loan Rule No-Action Letter. It is the Fund's understanding that issues under the Loan Rule affect other major accounting firms and many other investment company complexes. It is anticipated that an ultimate resolution of the issues under the Loan Rule will be achieved; however, if PwC were determined not to be independent or the Fund were unable to rely on the Loan Rule No-Action Letter or some form of exemptive relief, among other things, the financial statements audited by PwC may have to be audited by another independent registered public accounting firm and the Fund could incur additional expense and other burdens on its operations. 
PwC has audited the 2018 annual financial statements of the Fund and provided tax and other non-audit services to the Fund. PwC has also rendered audit and non-audit services to the Manager and other entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Manager (together, the "Affiliated Service Providers"). 
In making its recommendation, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision by PwC to the Fund of non-audit services or of professional services to the Affiliated Service Providers is compatible with maintaining the accountants' independence and has discussed the accountants' independence with them.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
Unless otherwise indicated, aggregate fees billed to the Fund for professional services provided to the Fund for 2018 and 2017 by PwC were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 AUDIT FEES*    $ 30,000      $ 28,950   
 AUDIT-RELATED FEES*      —          —     
 TAX FEES*      6,753        3,880   
 ALL OTHER FEES*      —          —     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  100% of the services performed during 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved  by the Audit Committee.  
[END TABLE]
Audit fees include amounts related to the audit of the Fund's annual financial statements and services normally provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. Audit-related fees are for audit-related services related to the Fund's semi-annual financial statements. Tax fees include amounts related to tax compliance services rendered for the Fund. 
The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve audit and non-audit services performed for the Fund by PwC. The Audit Committee also is required to pre-approve certain non-audit services performed for Columbia Management or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Columbia Management that provide services to the Fund and such services are directly related to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. Amounts pre-approved for such services were $749,000 in 2017 and $559,000 in 2018 for audit related services that primarily consist of internal controls reviews. The Audit Committee pre-approves permitted services at each regularly scheduled meeting, as needed. In instances where a permitted service requires pre-approval prior to a regularly scheduled meeting, pre-approval authority is delegated to Ms. Carlton (the Committee Chair). Any such pre-approval decision is reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under certain circumstances, preapproval of non-audit services of de minimis amount is not required. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting is required to ratify the selection of PwC as independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund. 
Your Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that the Stockholders Vote 
FOR 
the Ratification of the Selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Fund.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter that was last amended by the Fund's Board of Directors ("Board") at a November 2018 meeting. The purposes of the Audit Committee are 1) (i) to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Fund and its internal control over financial reporting; (ii) to oversee or assist Board oversight of the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statements and the independent audits thereof; (iii) to oversee or assist Board oversight of the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Fund's accounting and financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits; (iv) to approve the engagement of the Fund's independent auditors and to review and evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the independent auditors; and (v) to act as liaison between the independent auditors and the full Board; and 2) to furnish this report. Management of the Fund is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Fund's financial statements, the Fund's accounting and financial reporting principles and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for auditing the Fund's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has considered and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors of the Fund. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as currently in effect. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of any non-audit services not pre-approved by the Audit Committee provided by the Fund's independent auditors to the Manager and to any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Manager that provides ongoing services to the Fund is compatible with maintaining the auditors' independence. Finally, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding independence, and has discussed with the auditors the auditors' independence. 
The members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Fund and are not performing the functions of auditors or accountants. As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to set auditor independence standards. Members of the Audit Committee necessarily rely on the information provided to them by management and the independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the Fund's auditors are in fact "independent." 
Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above, the Audit Committee recommends the inclusion of the audited financial statements of the Fund in the Fund's annual report to Stockholders for the most recent fiscal year.
