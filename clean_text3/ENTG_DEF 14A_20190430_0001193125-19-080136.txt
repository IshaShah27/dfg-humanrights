Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
To Be Held on April 30, 2019 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Entegris, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Entegris" or the "Company"), for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the Company's headquarters at 129 Concord Road, Billerica, Massachusetts on Tuesday, April 30, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, and at any adjournment or adjournments of that meeting. You may obtain directions to the location of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders by contacting our Investor Relations Department either through the Internet at investor.Entegris.com/contactus.cfm or via email at irelations@entegris.com. This proxy statement, the foregoing Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the enclosed form of proxy and the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K are first being mailed or given to stockholders on or about March 20, 2019. 
PROXIES 
A stockholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted by executing and delivering to Entegris another proxy bearing a later date, by delivering a written notice to the Secretary of the Company stating that the proxy is revoked, or by voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Any properly completed proxy forms returned in time to be voted at the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If no instructions are indicated on the proxy, the proxy will be voted IN FAVOR of the election of the eight named nominees as directors and in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors with respect to other matters to come before the 2019 Annual Meeting. In addition, the proxy confers discretionary authority to vote on any other matter properly presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting which is not known to the Company as of the date of this proxy statement, unless the proxy directs otherwise. 
Stockholders may vote by proxy in one of the following three ways: (1) by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope by mail, (2) by completing a proxy using the toll-free telephone number listed on the proxy card in accordance with the specified instructions, or (3) by completing the proxy card via the Internet at the Internet address listed on the proxy card in accordance with the specified instructions. 
All costs of the solicitation of proxies will be borne by Entegris. In addition to solicitations by mail, the Company's directors, officers and regular employees, without additional remuneration, may solicit proxies by telephone, personal interviews and the Internet. Brokers, custodians and fiduciaries will be requested to forward proxy soliciting material to the owners of stock held in their names, and Entegris will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the distribution of proxy materials. 
VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTES REQUIRED 
The record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting was the close of business on March 8, 2019 (the "Record Date"). On the Record Date, there were 135,513,636 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Company's only voting securities, outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. Under the Company's By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. Shares of common stock represented in person or by proxy (including "broker non-votes" and shares which abstain or do not vote with respect to one or   more of the matters presented for stockholder approval) will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting is required for the election of directors (see "Corporate Governance – Majority Voting for Directors" below) and for the approval of the other matters listed in the Notice of Meeting. Shares which abstain from voting as to a particular matter, and shares held in "street name" by brokers or nominees, who indicate on their proxies that they do not have discretionary authority to vote such shares as to a particular matter, will not be counted as votes in favor of such matter, and will also not be counted as votes cast or shares voting on such matter. Accordingly, abstentions and "broker non-votes" will not be included in vote totals and will not affect the outcome of the voting on the election of the directors or the other matters listed in the Notice of Meeting. 
PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors are elected for a term of one year to succeed those directors whose terms are expiring. The persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect as directors the nominees designated by the Board of Directors, whose names are listed below, unless the proxy is marked otherwise. Each of the nominees has indicated his willingness to serve, if elected. However, if a nominee should be unable to serve, the shares of common stock represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. There are no family relationships between or among any officers or directors of Entegris. 
Merger Agreement; Potential Changes to the Board of Directors 
On January 27, 2019, Entegris entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Versum Materials, Inc. ("Versum"). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Versum into Entegris (the "Entegris-Versum Merger"), with Entegris surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation in the Entegris-Versum Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain previously disclosed customary mutual closing conditions, including approval of the Entegris-Versum Merger by the stockholders of Entegris and Versum. 
The Merger Agreement further provides that, at the effective time of the Entegris-Versum Merger (the "Effective Time"), Entegris' Board of Directors will have nine members, including (1) four directors who prior to the Effective Time were members of Entegris' Board of Directors (the "Entegris Designees"), (2) four directors who prior to the Effective Time were members of Versum's Board of Directors, including the Chairman of Versum's Board of Directors as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Versum Designees"), and (3) the Chief Executive Officer of Entegris as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement requires each of the Entegris Designees and Versum Designees to meet the independence standards of the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, with respect to Entegris as of the Effective Time. 
At the Effective Time, the Chief Executive Officer of Entegris as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will become the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and a member of the Board of Directors of the combined company, and the Chairman of Versum's Board of Directors as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be appointed to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the combined company. 
The Entegris-Versum Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2019, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the aforementioned closing conditions. Accordingly, Entegris expects that any changes to its Board of Directors that may occur pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement will occur after the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting. The pendency of the Entegris-Versum Merger has not resulted in any change to Entegris' nominees for director at the 2019 Annual Meeting. As described below, Entegris is nominating for re-election to its Board of Directors all of the currently serving members of its Board of Directors.  As of the date of this proxy statement, neither Entegris nor Versum has finally determined the identities of the Entegris Nominees or the Versum Nominees, respectively, but Entegris expects that, immediately following the Effective Time, Seifi Ghasemi, the current Chairman of the Board of Versum, will serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the combined company and that Bertrand Loy, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of Entegris, will serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and a member of the Board of Directors of the combined company. Entegris expects that the other members of the Board of Directors of the combined company will be determined before the Effective Time. Accordingly, Entegris expects that, upon the closing of the Entegris-Versum Merger, three of the individuals serving as members of the Board of Directors of Entegris immediately prior to the closing will cease to serve members of the Board of Directors of the combined company.

The Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Code of Business Ethics and the Charters of the Audit & Finance Committee, the Management Development & Compensation Committee and the Governance & Nominating Committee, as amended from time to time, are available on the Company's website at http://www.Entegris.com under "Investors – Corporate Governance" and will be provided in printed form to any stockholder who requests them from us. 
Director Independence 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of the directors shall be independent. Currently, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, our Board of Directors is comprised entirely of independent directors. The Board has determined that each of Michael A. Bradley, R. Nicholas Burns, James F. Gentilcore, James P. Lederer, Paul. L. H. Olson, Azita Saleki-Gerhardt and Brian F. Sullivan are "independent" as determined under the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules. The Entegris, Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that there will be an executive session, comprised exclusively of independent directors, at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a structure whereby the Chairman of the Board is an independent director. We believe that having a Chairman independent of management provides strong leadership for the Board and helps ensure critical and independent thinking with respect to the Company's strategy and performance. Our Chief Executive Officer is also a member of the Board of Directors as the management representative on the Board. We believe this is important to make information and insight concerning the Company's business directly available to the directors in their deliberations. Our Board believes that having separate positions, with an independent non-executive director serving as Chairman, is the appropriate leadership structure for our Company at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance. 
Our Chairman of the Board is responsible for the smooth functioning of our Board of Directors, enhancing its effectiveness by guiding Board processes and presiding at Board meetings and executive sessions of the independent directors. Our Chairman also presides at stockholder meetings and ensures that directors receive appropriate information from our Company to fulfill their responsibilities. Our Chairman is an ex officio member of each standing Board committee, providing guidance and, like all directors, taking an active role in evaluating our executive officers. Our Chairman also acts as a liaison between our Board and our executive management, promoting clear and open communication between management and the Board. 
Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. Our Board, either as a whole or through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our Company and the steps we take to manage them. While our Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at our Company, our Board standing committees assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight   responsibilities in certain areas of risk. In particular, our Audit & Finance Committee focuses on financial risk, including internal controls, and receives periodic risk assessment reports from our Internal Audit Department. Our Governance & Nominating Committee focuses on the management of risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for our directors and corporate governance. Finally, our Management Development & Compensation Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs, and related to succession planning for our executive officers. 
Risk Assessment with Respect to Compensation Policies and Practices 
At its December 2018 meeting, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") reviewed the various design elements of our compensation program to determine whether any of its aspects encourage excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. The scope of this review included aspects of executive compensation, as well as consideration of the items of our compensation policies and practices that affect all employees. In general, the process used by the Compensation Committee to complete its risk evaluation was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee identified the compensation related risk that the Company may face;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee identified the material design elements of our compensation policies and practices with respect to all employees; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee then evaluated whether there is a relationship between any of those design elements and any of our most significant risks.  More specifically, the Compensation Committee evaluated whether any of the design elements of our compensation policies and practices encourage our employees to take excessive or inappropriate risks that are reasonably likely to have a material  adverse impact on us.  
[END TABLE]
The result of the Compensation Committee's evaluation was a conclusion that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. More specifically, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation program is designed to encourage employees to take actions and pursue strategies that support our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, without promoting excessive or inappropriate risk. 
The design elements of our program (which are described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section below) do not include unusual or problematic compensatory schemes that have been linked to excessive risk-taking. Furthermore, the design elements of our compensation program that directly tie compensatory rewards to our performance include various counter-balances designed to offset potentially excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. For example, there is a balance between the fixed components of the program and the performance-based components. 
Similarly, with respect to the performance-based components, there is a balance between annual and longer-term incentives. Thus, the overall program is not too heavily weighted towards incentive compensation, in general, or short-term incentive compensation, in particular. The financial incentives are not based simply upon revenue. Rather, they are tied to performance metrics such as EBITA as a percentage of revenue, which more closely align the interests of management with the interests of our stockholders. The performance metrics for incentive payments are established annually and reflect goals that are a stretch, but not so high that they require performance outside of what the Compensation Committee believes is reasonable for us or could motivate management to take actions in which we assume unreasonable levels of risk. In addition, there are caps on how much performance-based compensation may be earned in a particular performance period and the Board of Directors has adopted a policy for clawback of performance-based compensation that was paid out in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the   federal securities laws. Furthermore, the Company maintains stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers, including the named executive officers, in order to assure the continuation of the close alignment of the interests of those executive officers with those of Entegris stockholders. The Compensation Committee also maintains an ongoing dialogue with our management to track progress on performance-based goals in order to foresee and avoid any excessive or inappropriate risk-taking that may otherwise be driven by a desire to maximize performance-based compensation. 
Related Party Transactions 
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy that prohibits any business transaction with a value of $60,000 or more between Entegris and our directors, nominees for director and executive officers or their immediate families. In addition, as part of our annual disclosure documentation process we circulate questionnaires to our directors, nominees for director and our executive officers requiring information as to any business transaction with a value of $60,000 or greater between Entegris and those persons or a member of his or her immediate family. The answers to these questionnaires are reviewed for compliance with this policy by management and discussed with the Audit & Finance Committee and our independent registered public accounting firm. Since January 1, 2018, there has been no such business transaction between Entegris and any director, nominee or executive officer or member of their immediate family. 
Majority Voting for Directors 
On December 17, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to the Company's By-Laws and to its Corporate Governance Guidelines to implement a change in the vote required to elect directors in uncontested elections of directors from a plurality-voting standard to a majority-voting standard. This change was effective as of the date of adoption. 
These amendments to the By-Laws provide that a director nominee will be elected in an uncontested director election only if the number of votes cast "for" the nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "against" the nominee. Directors are elected by a plurality vote at any "contested" election, which is defined as an election where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directorships to be filled. These amendments to the By-Laws also prohibit the Board from nominating for election (or filling a vacancy or newly created directorship with) any candidate who has not agreed in advance to submit an irrevocable resignation that would take effect upon (a) the failure to receive the required majority vote for reelection in the next election, and (b) the Board's acceptance of such resignation. These amendments to the By-Laws impose a similar requirement on director candidates nominated by stockholders. All nominees for election as director listed above have agreed to tender such a resignation. 
If an incumbent director does not receive the required vote for reelection, the Governance & Nominating Committee of the Board will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept the director's resignation; the Board will consider this recommendation and determine, within 90 days after certification of the election results, whether to accept the director's resignation and will promptly disclose its decision (including the reasons underlying the decision) in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Board and Committee Meetings 
The Board of Directors has a standing Audit & Finance Committee, Management Development & Compensation Committee and Governance & Nominating Committee, each of which is described in more detail below. The current members of each of the committees of the Board of Directors are as follows:

The Board of Directors has a standing Audit & Finance Committee, which provides the opportunity for direct contact between the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and the directors. As noted above, the Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit & Finance Committee, a copy of which is posted on the Company's web site http://www.Entegris.com under "Investors – Corporate Governance". The responsibilities of the Audit & Finance Committee include selection, appointment, compensation and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm as well as reviewing the scope and results of audits and reviewing the Company's internal accounting control policies and procedures. The Audit & Finance Committee held seven meetings during 2018. Each of the members of the Audit & Finance Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to be "independent" as defined under the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules and to comply with the independence requirements contemplated by Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of the Audit & Finance Committee possess the attributes of an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in the rules of the SEC. 
The Board of Directors also has a standing Management Development & Compensation Committee, which reviews executive compensation and management development programs and provides recommendations to the Board regarding Entegris' compensation programs. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Management Development & Compensation Committee, a copy of which is posted on the Company's web site http://www.Entegris.com under "Investors – Corporate Governance". The responsibilities of the Management Development & Compensation Committee include determining the compensation of the named executive officers and the compensation policies impacting other executive officers, reviewing and recommending changes to equity incentive and other employee benefit plans, reviewing the administration of such plans, reviewing the Company's management development programs and strategies and reviewing and recommending annual compensation for the Board. The Management Development & Compensation Committee held five meetings during 2018. The charter for the Management Development & Compensation Committee does not authorize the delegation of these responsibilities. Each of the members of the Management Development & Compensation Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to be "independent" as defined under the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules. 
The Board of Directors has a standing Governance & Nominating Committee, which provides recommendations to the Board regarding Entegris' corporate governance and corporate responsibility programs   and recommends nominees to be elected to the board of directors. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Governance & Nominating Committee, a copy of which is posted on the Company's web site http://www.Entegris.com under "Investors – Corporate Governance". The responsibilities of the Governance & Nominating Committee include the periodic review of corporate governance guidelines and matters related to corporate responsibility, review of matters relating to the size, composition, required skills and structure of the Board of Directors and committees thereof, the review and evaluation of potential candidates for nomination to the Board, recommendation to the Board of a slate of nominees for election as directors each year and the determination to accept or reject resignations of directors who fail to receive a majority vote for their re-election to the Board as described above. The Governance & Nominating Committee held two meetings during 2018. Each of the members of the Governance & Nominating Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to be "independent" as defined under the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules. 
The Board of Directors held seven meetings during 2018. Each current director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors and of any committee on which he or she served that was held during the period for which he or she was a director or member of any such committee. 
Director Nomination Process 
The Governance & Nominating Committee is responsible for managing the process for nomination of new directors. The committee may identify potential candidates for first-time nomination as a director using a variety of sources – recommendations from our management, current directors, stockholders or contacts in communities served by Entegris, or by conducting a formal search using an outside search firm selected and engaged by the Governance & Nominating Committee. Following the identification of a potential director-nominee, the Governance & Nominating Committee commences an inquiry to obtain sufficient information concerning the background of a potential new director-nominee. Included in this inquiry is an initial review of the candidate with respect to the following factors: (1) whether the individual meets the minimum qualifications for first-time director nominees specified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines; (2) whether the individual would be considered independent under applicable rules of NASDAQ and the SEC; and (3) whether the individual would meet any additional requirements imposed by law or regulation on the members of the Audit & Finance Committee and/or the Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Board. 
The Governance & Nominating Committee evaluates candidates for director nominees in the context of the current composition of the Board taking into account all factors it considers appropriate, including but not limited to, the characteristics of independence, skills, experience, availability for service to Entegris, tenure of incumbent directors on the Board and the anticipated needs of the Board of Directors. The Governance & Nominating Committee believes that the assessment of potential nominees to be recommended by the Governance & Nominating Committee should include consideration of the following factors: (i) a position capable of making, or a record of, valuable contributions to the business community, (ii) personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment and a reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust, respect, competence and adherence to the highest ethical standards, (iii) experience in the semiconductor/microelectronics industry or in other industries in which the Company operates; (iv) whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation and attendance at all meetings; (v) candor and willingness to operate on a team and to seek consensus; (vi) diversity with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, and geography; and (vii) relevant knowledge and diversity of background and experience in such things as business, manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing, international business, government and the like. The Board is committed to actively seeking out women and minority candidates as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills as part of each Board search the Company undertakes. In addition, at least one member of the Board should have accounting or related financial management expertise, as determined in the business judgment of the Board. The Governance & Nominating Committee will consider potential nominees recommended by our stockholders for such committee's consideration taking into account the same considerations as are taken into account for other potential nominees. Stockholders may recommend candidates by writing to the Chair,   Governance & Nominating Committee in care of the Company's Corporate Secretary at Entegris, Inc., 129 Concord Road, Billerica, MA 01821. Our By-Laws provide for additional procedures and requirements for stockholders wishing to nominate a director for election as part of the official business to be conducted at an annual stockholders meeting, as described further under "Stockholder Proposals and Nominees for 2020 Annual Meeting" below. In addition, as noted above, our By-Laws require that all nominees, as a condition to being nominated, agree to submit an irrevocable resignation that would take effect upon (a) the failure to receive the required vote for reelection in the next election, and (b) the Board's acceptance of such resignation. 
Communications with the Independent Directors 
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate directly with a member or members of the Board of Directors or the non-management directors either individually or as a group by addressing their correspondence to the director or directors, c/o our Corporate Secretary, at the address listed above, with a request to forward the same to the intended recipient. All such communications will be reviewed by the Company's Corporate Secretary and if they are relevant to the Company's operations, policies and philosophies, they will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Board (Mr. Olson). The Chairman of the Board will provide to the directors copies or summaries of any such stockholder communications as he considers appropriate. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Members of the Board of Directors are encouraged to attend Annual Meetings of Stockholders. All current directors then in office attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Director Compensation 
The Board of Directors has adopted the following compensation arrangements for non-employee directors: an annual cash retainer of $75,000. Committee chairs receive an annual fee of: $10,000 for the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee, $20,000 for the Chair of the Audit & Finance Committee and $15,000 for the Chair of the Management Development & Compensation Committee. Non-employee directors are also entitled to an annual equity award of $145,000 worth of restricted stock units valued on the date of each Annual Meeting with restrictions lapsing on the earlier of the date of the next Annual Meeting or the first anniversary of the award date. In addition, non-employee directors are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with services as a director. The Entegris Board of Directors adopted the following compensation arrangement for the independent Chairman of the Board (Mr. Olson): the above specified annual cash retainer plus an annual chair's cash retainer of $55,000. All of the foregoing fees are based on a June 2018 through May 2019 fiscal period and are paid quarterly in advance. Mr. Loy receives no compensation for his service as a director.

Stock Ownership Guidelines for Directors 
During 2018, the Board of Directors maintained stock ownership guidelines for directors in order to assure the close alignment of director interests with those of Entegris stockholders. This alignment is a critical objective of the equity awards discussed above. Under these guidelines, which were amended in May 2018, each director shall be required to hold Entegris Common Stock with a value equal to five (5) times the annual cash retainer in effect at the time of each annual determination. Determination of compliance with this guideline is made as of January 15th of each year. Compliance with this guideline will be calculated based on the average of the prior calendar year's month end closing prices on the NASDAQ for Entegris Common Stock. Shares of Entegris Common Stock that are owned by a director outright as well as vested deferred shares/units count towards compliance with this guideline. Directors have five (5) years following their initial election to the Entegris Board of Directors or the date on which the Stock Ownership Guidelines were adopted to achieve the minimum holding required by the guidelines. As of January 15, 2019, all directors were in compliance with the stock ownership guideline policy or were within the five-year compliance grace period. 
COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Set forth below is summary information concerning certain compensation earned, paid or awarded during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 by the Company to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and to the three other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of fiscal 2018. Throughout this proxy statement we refer to these individuals collectively as the named executive officers.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSIONAND ANALYSIS 
Objectives of Executive Compensation Policies 
The Company's executive compensation policies are designed so that: (i) total compensation is tied to individual performance, (ii) total compensation will vary with the Company's performance in achieving financial and other strategic objectives, and (iii) long-term incentive compensation is closely aligned with stockholders' interests. Further, the Company's executive compensation policies provide that the proportion of variable compensation increases as an employee's level of responsibility increases so that compensation for senior executives is aligned with the Company's performance. For these reasons, the Company's executive compensation policies prioritize: pay-for-performance, competitive compensation, employee retention and alignment with stockholders' interests. The overall objectives of the executive compensation policies are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, retain, motivate and reward high-caliber executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• foster teamwork and support the achievement of Entegris' financial and strategic goals through performance based financial incentives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• promote the achievement of strategic objectives which lead to long-term growth in stockholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• encourage strong financial performance by establishing competitive goals for target performance and leveraging incentive programs through stock-based  compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of executive officers with those of Entegris and its stockholders by making incentive compensation dependent upon Company  performance.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), which is comprised solely of independent non-employee directors, as described under "Corporate Governance" above, retained the services of the independent compensation advisory firm Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") to assist with the review and evaluation of the Company's compensation policies and to suggest new or alternative compensation arrangements where appropriate. The use of an independent consultant provides additional assurance that our programs are reasonable and consistent with the Company's objectives. The Compensation Committee selected FW Cook based on its national reputation as an expert in compensation practices, its industry knowledge, and its familiarity with the Company and its past compensation practices. FW Cook reports to and takes direction from the Compensation Committee. The assignment of projects by management to FW Cook requires the prior approval of the Compensation Committee. During 2018, FW Cook performed services primarily for the Compensation Committee under its direction and performed only incidental consulting services for Entegris. 
In addition, in establishing its compensation policies for a given year, the Compensation Committee will evaluate the results from the most recent shareholder advisory vote on compensation to consider any implications of such advisory vote for the Compensation Committee's compensation policies and determine whether any changes are appropriate. At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 97% of the votes cast with respect to the advisory vote on executive compensation voted to approve the compensation paid in 2017 to the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee determined that no significant change in its compensation policies should be recommended to the Board as a result of this advisory vote. 
Evaluation of Compensation against External Data 
In the design of the 2018 compensation programs, the Compensation Committee evaluated each element of target total direct compensation (the sum of base salary, target annual incentive and grant date present value of long-term incentives) as well as total compensation against corresponding compensation data from comparable companies collected by FW Cook. The Compensation Committee compared the Company's compensation practices and target compensation levels to that provided to executives among a group of companies that were evaluated by FW Cook and the Compensation Committee as being comparable to Entegris. In 2017, the   Compensation Committee, working with FW Cook, further reviewed and revised the peer group in light of mergers and acquisition activity and the Company's strategic focus on specialty chemicals, removing two acquired peers (CLARCOR Inc. and Intersil Corporation). The revised 18 company peer group shown below was approved by the Compensation Committee to inform its decisions with respect to target total direct compensation levels for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.   FLIR Systems, Inc.    MKS Instruments, Inc. 
 Cabot Microelectronics Corporation   Graco Inc.    Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. 
 Coherent, Inc.   II-VI Incorporated    Teradyne, Inc. 
 Cree, Inc.   Innospec Inc.    TTM Technologies, Inc. 
 Diodes Incorporated   Materion Corporation    Versum Materials, Inc. 
 Ferro Corporation   Microsemi Corporation    Watts Water Technologies, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
This group has been designed so that the Company's size relative to the foregoing peer companies approximates the median in terms of revenue, operating income and market capitalization because these are the metrics that most strongly correlate to market target compensation levels. In addition, these peer companies operate in similar or related industries to the Company. 
Information concerning the compensation practices of these companies was drawn from their proxy statements or other public filings. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the peer group, with the assistance of FW Cook to assure that the companies included continue to be as closely comparable to the Company as reasonably possible. 
FW Cook supplemented this data with compensation survey data from technology companies and a broader, general industry compensation survey to develop a composite market perspective on competitive pay levels. As a general matter, the Compensation Committee intends to set target total direct compensation for the named executive officers at the market median with deviations as appropriate for individual executives to reflect factors such as tenure, performance and criticality to the Company. 
Based upon the Compensation Committee's review of the compensation arrangements discussed below, the compensation levels of the above peer companies, general market pay practices for executives and its assessments of individual and corporate performance, the Company and the Compensation Committee believe that the value and design of the Company's executive compensation policies for 2018 were appropriate. While executive officers, principally the Senior Vice President for Human Resources, worked closely with the Compensation Committee and with FW Cook, to design Entegris' compensation programs for 2018, the Compensation Committee ultimately decides which policies to adopt and directs and approves the design of all compensation programs as well as the specific compensation paid to each of the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. Discussions concerning CEO compensation are between FW Cook and the Compensation Committee without executive officer involvement.  Elements of Compensation 
The 2018 Entegris compensation program for senior executives, including the named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table below, consisted of a number of elements which are summarized in the following table. Due to Entegris' focus on short-term incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation, illustrated in the table below, a meaningful portion of each executive officer's target total direct compensation is dependent on the Company's performance. Approximately 56% of the Chief Executive Officer's target total direct compensation and approximately 45% of the target total direct compensation of the other named executive officers is "at risk", being dependent on the Company's performance.

Short-Term Incentive Compensation (Entegris Incentive Plan)     Rewards achievement of Company financial performance criteria to:   Incentivize the achievement of annual financial performance metrics that will drive our  long-term success; and   Incentivize achievement of  pre-established business objectives.    In 2018, Entegris Incentive Plan awards were again based on the Companys performance with respect to EBITA as a percentage of revenue (weighted 75%) and on the achievement of  specified key business objectives for the year (weighted 25%). During 2018, the Companys performance exceeded the target level for the EBITA metric and met some of the key business objectives qualifying for a combined weighted-average award of  139.6% of target.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation     The Company awards to its executive officers time vested restricted stock units and stock options, which both vest ratably over four  years, and performance share units that provide the opportunity to earn shares of the Company based on the Companys total shareholder return (TSR) as compared with the TSR achieved by the companies that comprise the Philadelphia Semiconductor  Index over a three-year period. The purposes for long-term incentive awards are to:   Promote executive ownership of our stock;   Promote retention of executives in a normally competitive labor market over the longer  term;   Encourage management focus on critical performance metrics creating value  for stockholders; and   Align the program with peer group and market practices,  where appropriate.    No changes to the long-term incentive award type use and mix were made for 2018. Named executive officer grants were delivered in stock options (weighted 30% on a value basis),  relative total shareholder return PSUs (weighted 30%) and time-vested restricted stock units (weighted 40%), as described under Long-Term Incentive Compensation below.

The use of these compensation elements enables us to reinforce our pay for performance philosophy and to strengthen our ability to attract and retain high-quality executives. The Company and the Compensation Committee believe that this combination of compensation elements provides an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay and achieves an appropriate balance between short-term financial and operational performance and long-term shareholder value. The Compensation Committee determines the amount of compensation under each component of executive compensation granted to the executive officers to emphasize performance-based compensation tied to financial metrics approved by the Compensation Committee and to achieve the appropriate balance between cash compensation and equity compensation, as well as to reflect the level of responsibility of the executive officer. There is no pre-established policy or target for the allocation between either cash and non-cash or short-term and long-term incentive compensation. With respect to fiscal 2018, the total compensation paid or awarded to the named executive officers included both short-term cash incentive compensation and equity based long-term incentive compensation. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee has in the past analyzed, and expects that, from time to time, it will analyze, tally sheets prepared for each senior executive, including the named executive officers as a benchmark for its compensation decisions. Typically, these tally sheets have been prepared by our human resources and finance departments. Each of these tally sheets presents the dollar amount of each major component of the named executive officers' compensation, including current cash compensation (base salary and short-term incentive compensation), accumulated deferred compensation balances and outstanding equity awards. The overall purpose of the tally sheets is to bring together in one place, all of the elements of actual and potential future compensation of our named executive officers, as well as information about wealth accumulation, so that the Compensation Committee may analyze both aggregate total amount of actual and projected compensation as well as internal pay equity and other decisions regarding executive compensation.  When making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee also looks at the target total direct compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and the other named executive officers relative to that provided to similarly-situated executives at the market data provided by FW Cook. The Compensation Committee believes, however, that a benchmark should be a point of reference for measurement – but not the determinative factor for our executives' target compensation. The purpose of the comparison is merely to supplement and not to supplant the analyses of internal pay equity, wealth accumulation potential and the individual performance of the executive officers that we consider when making compensation decisions. Because the comparative compensation information is just one of the several analytical tools that are used in setting executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has discretion in determining whether to use this information and/or the nature and extent of its use. 
Base Salary 
In general, base salary for each employee, including the named executive officers, is established based on the individual's job responsibilities, performance and experience; the Company's overall budget for merit increases; and the competitive environment. Each year, we survey the compensation practices of companies serving the semiconductor and other industries deemed relevant as well as general market pay practices for executives in the United States and in other countries in which we have significant employee populations in order to assess the competitiveness of the compensation we offer. In addition, for senior executives, including the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee evaluates base salary against corresponding compensation data from our peer group. In fiscal 2018, we continued to target base salary at the median of the peer group proxy and survey market reference points compiled by FW Cook. 
As noted above, the Company and the Compensation Committee believe that our success is dependent on our ability to hire and retain high-caliber executives in critical functions, and the pursuit of this objective may require us to recruit individual executives who have significant compensation and retention packages in place with other employers. In order to attract such individuals to Entegris, we may be required to negotiate compensation packages that deviate from the general principle of targeting base pay at the market median. Similarly, we may determine to provide compensation outside of the normal cycle to individuals to address retention issues. 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation 
Entegris has for a number of years maintained a short-term variable incentive compensation program, the Entegris Incentive Plan ("EIP"), which generally provides for a potential cash award based upon the achievement of annual financial and operating performance objectives in accordance with a sliding scale established by the Compensation Committee, subject to adjustment by the Compensation Committee, with a fractional award for performance above the threshold level, a full award for target performance and a premium award of up to 200% of target for extraordinary performance. In addition to the financial criteria and operating performance objectives, awards under the EIP are conditioned on the Company achieving an operating profit. During 2018, the Chief Executive Officer continued to be eligible to receive an incentive compensation payment targeting 100% of his base salary and the named executive officers listed in the "Summary Compensation Table" below other than the Chief Executive Officer continued to be eligible to receive an incentive compensation payment ranging from 60% to 75% of their base salary at target performance. The EIP is administered by, and all awards are made at the discretion of, the Compensation Committee. 
Under this plan, with respect to 2018, an incentive pool is established based upon the level of the attainment of financial objectives established by the Compensation Committee. For 2018, the EIP awards were based on: (i) the achievement of EBITA as a percentage of revenue within a range established by the Compensation Committee (from threshold of 11.5% of revenue to maximum of 27.5% of revenue) with target performance established at 19.5%, weighted at 75% and providing for awards ranging from 0% of target for threshold or below threshold performance to a maximum of 200% of target for performance at the top of the range; and   (ii) the achievement of critical business objectives (relating to revenue growth, key product initiatives, and operational performance), weighted at 25% and providing for awards ranging from 0% for threshold or below threshold performance (depending on the particular objective) to 200% of target if all critical business objectives were achieved at the maximum level specified. For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an EIP payout of 139.6% of target. 
The EIP awards for the named executive officers for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 are reflected in the column entitled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the 2018 EIP award is also reflected in the "Fiscal Year 2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards" table below. 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
During 2018, executives and certain key employees were eligible to receive equity grants and awards under the Entegris 2010 Stock Plan, as amended, which is administered by the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock unit awards, stock option awards and performance share unit awards, as described below, were the three equity vehicles used by Entegris for long-term incentive awards to executive officers during 2018. The 2018 long-term incentive awards to the named executive officers are listed in the "Fiscal Year 2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards" table below under the columns entitled "Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards", "All Other Stock Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units" and "All Other Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying Options". 
The Compensation Committee believes that long-term incentive awards to executive officers, including the named executive officers, should be comprised of a mixture of restricted stock units, stock options and performance share units. Accordingly, for 2018 the Compensation Committee approved equity awards for executive officers comprised, as a percentage of the total annual grant value, of 40% restricted stock units, 30% stock options and 30% performance share units, which has been unchanged since 2015. A description of the terms of each type of equity award and the reasons why the Compensation Committee believes each is an appropriate long term incentive equity vehicle follows. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock Units. Forty percent of the 2018 equity award to executive officers consisted of restricted stock units, with restrictions  lapsing in four equal installments on  February 19th of the first through the fourth  years following the date of award. The award of restricted stock units is designed to enable the Company to retain executive officers and other key employees during turbulent economic times and in a competitive labor market. In addition, non-executive employees receiving equity awards in 2018 received restricted stock units, with the restrictions lapsing ratably over four years in accordance with the foregoing schedule.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Options. Thirty percent of the 2018 equity awards to executive officers consisted of stock options to vest in four equal installments on  February 19th of the first through the fourth years  following the date of grant and have a seven-year term. The Compensation Committee believes that the award of stock options is an effective mechanism to align the interests of our executive officers with those of Entegris stockholders which is  expected to lead to an increase in the long-term value of Entegris. This is because stock options only provide value to the awardee if the price of the Company's stock appreciates, which creates a strong performance orientation, consistent with  our pay for performance philosophy. All stock options granted to executive officers by our predecessor companies and by the Company were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Share Units. Thirty percent of the 2018 equity awards to executive officers, consisted of performance share units, which provide the  opportunity to earn shares of the Company based on the Company's TSR as compared with the TSR achieved by the companies that comprise the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index over a three year period following the date of award. Early in 2018, each  recipient of a performance share award received a target allocation of performance share units; the final number of shares which may be earned range from 0% to 150% of target. The number of shares   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     actually earned at the end of the performance period is based on a pre-established payout curve, which provides for earn outs of 50%, 100% and 150% of  target for performance at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, respectively, with linear interpolation between such levels (no shares are earned for performance below  the 25th percentile). Performance share awards are also  subject to limitation: (i) if the Company's absolute TSR is negative then the maximum number of shares that may be earned is the target performance share allocation; and (ii) in no event may the value of shares earned on the vesting  date exceed 300% of the initial grant date fair value of the target share allocation at award. Performance share units earned over the three year performance period will be fully vested on the last day of the performance period and are settled as  soon as practicable following certification of the Compensation Committee of the amount of shares earned. The Compensation Committee included performance share units as a component of the 2018 long term incentive award for executive officers because  the Compensation Committee believes that relative TSR is an important metric for our stockholders evaluation of the Company's performance against the performance of other companies; the performance share units thus create an additional  alignment with stockholder interests through an objective and relatively simple performance metric. In addition, based on the Compensation Committee's review of peer company market data, it believes that TSR based performance share units are  becoming an increasingly significant portion of equity incentives used by those companies that will compete with us in attracting, hiring, motivating and retaining a talented, entrepreneurial and creative team of executives. In February 2019, with  respect to the performance share units awarded for the 2016-2018 performance period, the Compensation Committee certified that Entegris' stock performed at the 95th percentile versus companies in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, resulting  in the vesting of shares at 103.66% of target, including the impact of the limitation described in clause (ii) above.  
[END TABLE]
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Company maintains stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers, including the named executive officers, in order to assure the continuation of the close alignment of the interests of those executive officers who are elected by the Board of Directors with those of Entegris stockholders. This alignment is a critical objective of the long-term incentive compensation discussed above. The guidelines, which were amended in May 2018, provide that the Chief Executive Officer should attain and maintain beneficial ownership of Entegris stock having a value equal to six times his annual base salary; Executive Vice Presidents should attain and maintain beneficial ownership of Entegris stock with a value equal to four times their respective annual base salaries, the Chief Financial Officer should attain and maintain beneficial ownership of Entegris stock with a value equal to three times his annual base salary, Senior Vice Presidents should attain and maintain beneficial ownership of Entegris stock with a value equal to two times their annual base salary and other executive officers should attain and maintain beneficial ownership of Entegris stock with a value equal to their annual base salary. Since Mr. Graves is also an Executive Vice President, he is held to the higher ownership standard of four times base salary. For purposes of the stock ownership guidelines, beneficial ownership of Entegris stock includes direct holdings, indirect holdings by immediate family and 401(k) and employee stock ownership plans, restricted stock and restricted stock units and the net share value of in-the-money vested and unvested stock options. The guidelines also provide that executives should achieve this beneficial ownership of Entegris stock within five years of their appointment to these positions and thereafter maintain that level of ownership. As of February 1, 2019, all of the named executive officers serving at the end of 2018 were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines or were within the five-year compliance grace period. 
Tax Deductibility 
The Company structures its compensation policies so that the compensation it pays is deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes whenever it is reasonably possible to do so, while also meeting its compensation objectives, though recent changes to tax law, described below, make it more difficult to pay deductible compensation for certain individuals. In any event, certain non-deductible compensation may be paid,   and the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reserve the authority to award non-deductible compensation to executives in appropriate circumstances or to modify compensation initially intended to be deductible if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company's best interests. 
At the time the Compensation Committee made its 2018 compensation decisions, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code placed a one million dollar limit on the amount of compensation that the Company could deduct for tax purposes for any year with respect to the executive who serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at year-end, and any of the Company's three other most highly compensated employees who serve as executive officers at year-end, other than the Chief Financial Officer. The one million dollar limit did not apply to performance-based compensation, as defined under Section 162(m). However, the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) was repealed by tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to current and former named executive officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, in excess of one million dollars will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee will continue to focus on performance-based compensation, though certain of the requirements of Section 162(m) will no longer be relevant, and thus will not be taken into consideration when setting future compensation. 
Chief Executive Officer Compensation 
The Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation package of the Chief Executive Officer of Entegris in accordance with the objectives and methodology described above. In evaluating the Chief Executive Officer's target total direct compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee also considered compensation levels of chief executive officers in the market pay analysis conducted by FW Cook, individual performance and Entegris' recent financial performance. 
In connection with Mr. Loy's promotion to Chief Executive Officer in 2012, on December 12, 2012 the Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Mr. Loy employing him as President and Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO Agreement"). The CEO Agreement took effect as of November 28, 2012 and cancelled and replaced the Severance Protection Agreement, dated May 13, 2011, between the Company and Mr. Loy. As of December 31, 2018, under the CEO Agreement, Mr. Loy receives a base salary of $850,000 per year (which reflects increases in each of 2018, 2016 and 2015) and variable compensation pursuant to the EIP at a target performance equal to 100% of base salary. Mr. Loy is eligible to participate in the Company's Long-Term Incentive Program and to receive equity awards from time to time as determined by the Board of Directors. The CEO Agreement is subject to annual automatic renewal unless the Board sends notice of non-renewal sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the initial or any renewal term. In the event that Mr. Loy's employment is terminated by the Board without cause or by Mr. Loy for "good reason" as defined in the CEO Agreement (generally, removal from office, material diminution of his duties, authority or compensation, breach of the CEO Agreement by the Company, or failure to require a successor corporation to assume the CEO Agreement) then Mr. Loy is entitled to accrued but unpaid compensation; a severance benefit of salary continuation for a period of two (2) years following termination, which, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2018, would be $1,700,000; the continuation of health and dental benefits for Mr. Loy and his immediate family for the entirety of such severance pay period; and all equity awards outstanding as of the date of termination shall continue to vest in accordance with each award's original vesting schedule and vested awards shall continue to be exercisable during such severance period and for a period of 90 days thereafter. In the event that Mr. Loy's employment is terminated by reason of death or disability, then all unvested equity awards outstanding as of the date of such termination vest, the value of which, assuming a date of December 31, 2018, are shown in columns (e) and (f) in the table in "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" below, and Mr. Loy or his representative have a period of one year following termination to exercise vested stock options. In addition, the CEO Agreement imposes non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality covenants on Mr. Loy which continue for the duration of the above referenced severance period. In addition, as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below, Mr. Loy has an agreement providing him with certain   severance benefits in the event that his employment is terminated after a Change in Control of the Company. During 2013, Mr. Loy agreed to amend this Change in Control Agreement to remove the change in control tax gross-up provisions. 
Benefits 
We provide benefit programs to executive officers and to other employees. The following table generally identifies such benefit plans and identifies those U.S. employees who may be eligible to participate:

All Entegris officers receive company-paid Long-Term Disability coverage that provides a monthly benefit of 60% of qualified salary to a maximum of $15,000 per month.  
[END TABLE]
Personal Benefits 
The Company does not offer the named executive officers perquisites other than the life and disability insurance (which is cost effective for the Company), and relocation expenses and allowances. 
Retirement Plan 
During 2018, Entegris offered retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the tax-qualified Entegris, Inc. 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (2017 Restatement), hereafter referred to as the 401(k) Plan, which generally provides for an employer match for employee contributions. Executive officers participated in the 401(k) Plan on the same terms as those available for other eligible employees in the U.S. The 401(k) Plan provides a long-term savings vehicle that allows for pre-tax and/or post-tax Roth contributions by employees and tax-deferred earnings. The Company made matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan equal to 100% of such employee contributions on the first 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the next 2% of eligible compensation, not to exceed the annual IRS limit. 
In connection with the 401(k) Plan we also maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Under this non-qualified retirement plan, certain senior executives, including the named executive officers, are allowed certain salary deferral benefits that would otherwise be lost by reason of restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code limiting the amount of compensation which may be deferred under tax-qualified plans. Compensation that may be deferred into the non-qualified retirement plan include employee and matching employer contributions that are in excess of the maximum deferral amount allowed under the terms of the 401(k) Plan. Participant accounts are credited with an investment return equivalent to that provided by the investment vehicles elected by the participant, which may be allocated among the same investment funds as are offered with respect to the 401(k) Plan accounts. 
The individual participant balances in the 401(k) Plan and the above non-qualified retirement plan reflect a combination of: (1) the annual amount contributed by the Company or by the employee to the 401(k) Plan and the non-qualified retirement plan and the amount of his or her cash compensation that the employee elects to   defer; (2) the annual contributions and/or deferred amounts being invested at the direction the employee (the same investment choices are available to all participants); and (3) the continuing reinvestment of the investment returns until the accounts are paid out. This means that similarly situated employees, including the named executive officers, may have materially different account balances because of a combination of these factors. See the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table" below for more information on account balances and earnings under this non-qualified retirement plan for the named executive officers. 
Summary Compensation Table 
The following table summarizes the reportable compensation, in accordance with Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, to the named executive officers for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

(1)  The employer matching contribution reflected in column (c) is established by an offset formula which includes contributions to the  employee's 401(k) account in the calculation of the employer matching contribution under this non-qualified retirement plan. The amounts listed for each of the named executive officers in column  (c) is detailed with respect to each named executive officer in footnote 7 to the Summary Compensation Table above in clause (b) of that footnote.  
(2)  The amounts listed for each of the named executive officers in column (d) is determined by the size of the  non-qualified retirement plan account of the respective named executive officers and by their respective investment elections under the SERP from among the same investment funds that are offered under the  Company's 401(k) plan.  
(3)  The amounts in column (f) represent the fully vested balance as of December 31, 2018 and include amounts deferred in previous years.  These amounts include contributions reported in the summary compensation table for years 2017 and 2016 as follows: Mr. Loy, $56,403 and $49,095, respectively; Mr. Graves, $20,098 and $16,595, respectively; Mr. Edlund, $21,915 and  $12,581, respectively; Ms. Rice, $0 and $0, respectively; and Mr. Haris, $8,097 and $0, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
The Company also maintains a Deferred Compensation Plan that permits eligible participants, subject to certain restrictions, to defer a specified portion of his or her base salary, incentive compensation and stock compensation for a fixed period specified by the eligible participant at the time the deferral election is made. Eligible participants are those employees who qualify as highly compensated within the meaning of ERISA and who have been designated as eligible by the Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Amounts deferred under this plan receive notional earnings based on the investment performance of investments selected by the eligible participant from among the same selection of   investment funds as are offered under the Company's 401(k) plan. During 2018, none of the named executive officers participated in this plan. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control 
There are currently in effect Executive Change in Control Termination Agreements with Mr. Loy, Mr. Graves, Mr. Edlund, and Ms. Rice to provide them with certain severance benefits in the event of a "Change of Control" of Entegris. A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred when (1) any person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 30% or more of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock, (2) if those members who constituted a majority of the Board of Directors cease to be so or (3) if an agreement for the merger or other acquisition of the Company is consummated. If during the two-year period following a Change in Control the executive's employment is terminated or if the executive terminates employment for "good cause" (as defined in the agreement – generally certain adverse changes to the terms or conditions of the executive's employment), a so-called "double trigger", then the executive will become immediately entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  payment of all unpaid compensation and expenses earned or incurred prior to the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii)  a lump-sum severance payment equal to the sum of two times the executive's base salary plus two  times the greater of the highest annual bonus during the three years prior to termination or target bonus for the year of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii)  medical, dental and life insurance benefits for executive and executive's family members for a period of two years following the date of  termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iv)  immediate vesting of all unvested equity awards, and, in the case of stock options, the ability to exercise stock options for a period of up  to one year following such termination (or, if earlier, until the expiration date of the options); and

The net value of in-the-money vested and unvested stock options based on the  closing price of the Company's stock on the last trading day of 2018, is: (a) in the case of Mr. Loy – $7,395,356; (b) in the case of Mr. Graves – $1,237,122; (c) in the case of Mr. Edlund – $1,788,296; (d) in  the case of Ms. Rice – $0; and (e) in the case of Mr. Haris – $71,467.  
(4)  Reflects the value of restricted stock units and performance share units, which are calculated assuming the Company achieves target  performance, still subject to restrictions and valued based on the closing price of the Company's stock on the last trading day of 2018 ($27.90).  
[END TABLE]
The change in control agreements for Mr. Graves and Mr. Edlund also provide for an additional tax "gross-up" payment to the executive of an amount sufficient to satisfy, on an after-tax basis, any excise tax payable by such executive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as a result of any payments or benefits received by him. The change in control agreements also include a confidentiality covenant and two year post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants by each named executive officer. As noted above, pursuant to the Company's policy, new change in control agreements entered into after 2013 do not contain any change in control tax gross-up provisions. 
Severance Benefits in Connection with Termination. As describe above in "Chief Executive Officer Compensation" and "Employment Agreements", Mr. Loy and Mr. Graves have certain agreements with the Company that provide for severance in the event they are terminated by us without "cause" or if they are terminated "for good reason". Please see those discussions for a detailed description of the terms of those agreements and a description of the estimated payments and benefits in the event they are terminated by us without "cause" or if they are terminated "for good reason". 
Treatment of Equity Awards in Connection with a Change in Control. With respect to performance share units, if the awards held by executives are assumed or continued in connection with a change in control, performance would be determined based on actual performance through the consummation of a change in control and the awards would continue to vest following such change in control based on continued service through the end of the performance period, except that if the executive is terminated without cause or resigns with good reason during the 24 months following the change in control, the award would vest "double-trigger" upon such termination. If performance share units are not assumed or continued in connection with a change in control, awards held by executives would vest upon the consummation of the change in control, with performance determined based on actual performance through the consummation of the change in control. 
With respect to restricted stock units and stock options, if the awards are assumed or continued in connection with a change in control, the awards would vest "double-trigger" upon the executive's termination without cause, or, to the extent provided in his or her Executive Change in Control Termination Agreements, upon the executive's resignation for "good cause." If such restricted stock units and stock options held by executives are not assumed or continued in connection with a change in control, the awards would vest upon the consummation of the change in control. In addition, in the event of a "covered transaction" (which is generally defined as (i) a consolidation or merger in which Entegris is not the surviving corporation or which results in the acquisition of all of Entegris' common stock by a single person or entity or group of persons acting in concert, (ii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of Entegris' assets, or (iii) a dissolution or liquidation of Entegris), outstanding restricted stock units and stock options would vest in full upon the consummation of the covered transaction. 
The Entegris-Versum Merger. The Board of Directors has determined to treat the consummation of the Entegris-Versum Merger as a "change in control" or term of similar meaning for purposes of Entegris' compensation plans and arrangements, including its equity awards and severance agreements.  CEO Pay Ratio 
We believe that there has been no significant change to the Company's employee population or compensation arrangements and the median employee's circumstances have not changed. There have been no changes that the Company reasonably believes would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. As a result, we are using the same median employee for the calculation of the 2018 CEO Pay Ratio as we did for the 2017 CEO Pay Ratio. In 2017, to determine the pay ratio required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company first identified the median employee using our global employee population as of December 31, 2017, which included all global full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that were employed on that date. The Company used "gross wages paid" as the consistently applied compensation measure across its global employee population, measured from January 1 through December 31, 2017, to calculate the median employee compensation. The Company annualized the compensation for any full-time and part-time employees that it hired in 2017 and that were employed on December 31, 2017. The median employee was identified in 2017 and compensation for the same median employee is being utilized for 2018. The Company determined this median employee's annual total compensation using the Summary Compensation Table methodology as detailed in Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, and compared it to the total compensation of our CEO, as detailed in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 to arrive at the pay ratio disclosed below. The Company's median employee's 2018 compensation was approximately $52,736 and the Company's CEO's 2018 compensation was $4,726,687. As a result, pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company's 2018 CEO to median employee pay ratio is approximately 89.6:1. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
During 2014, the Board of Directors adopted a policy against hedging, pledging and speculative transactions in the Company's stock. This policy covers directors, Executive Officers, employees and consultants and prohibits, directly or indirectly engaging in any hedging or monetization transactions with respect to the Company's securities; pledging, hypothecating, or otherwise encumbering shares of the Company's common stock or other equity securities as collateral for indebtedness, or engaging in short-term or speculative transactions in the Company's securities including short-term trading where the Company's securities are sold within six months following the purchase (or vice versa) and short sales of the Company's securities (i.e., the sale of a security that the seller does not own). 
Clawback Policy 
In December 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an incentive compensation clawback policy. The Compensation Committee determined that it may be appropriate to recoup or "claw back" certain annual cash and long-term equity incentive compensation in specified situations. The Company may recoup paid incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, seek to recoup the difference between the incentive compensation paid and the lower amount that would have been paid based upon accurate information or restated financial results. The Compensation Committee has flexibility to update the policy to be consistent with any subsequent SEC rules on this topic. In addition, the Company now includes a specific reference to this clawback right in its equity award agreements. 
Management Development & Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The current members of the Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors are James F. Gentilcore, Chair, R. Nicholas Burns, James P. Lederer, and Azita Saleki-Gerhardt. No member of the Management Development & Compensation Committee was at any time during fiscal year 2018 an officer or employee or former officer or employee of either the Company or of any   subsidiary, nor has any member of such committee had any relationship with Entegris requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933. 
During fiscal 2018, no executive officer of the Company has served as a director or member of the compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of or member of the Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Company. 
MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT & COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Management Development & Compensation Committee of the Company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's directors and officers and persons who own more than 10 percent of Entegris Common Stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Entegris common stock.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE 
The Audit & Finance Committee is currently composed of four members and acts under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The members of the Audit & Finance Committee are independent directors, as defined in the Audit & Finance Committee Charter and in the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
The Audit & Finance Committee reviewed the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and discussed these financial statements with the Company's management. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. Management represented to the Audit & Finance Committee that the Company's financial statements had been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit & Finance Committee selected KPMG LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, which selection was ratified by the Stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and to issue a report on those financial statements. More specifically, the Audit & Finance Committee reviews, evaluates, and discusses with the Company's management and with the independent registered public accounting firm, the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the plan for, and report of the independent registered public accounting firm on each audit of the Company's financial statements;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's financial disclosure documents, including all financial statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or  sent to stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in the Company's accounting practices, principles, controls or methodologies; significant developments or changes in accounting rules  applicable to the Company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the adequacy of the Company's internal controls and accounting, financial and auditing personnel and the areas of risk that could impact the  Company's business.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit & Finance Committee also reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements and the matters required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Audit Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees) with KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018. PCAOB Audit Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees) requires the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to discuss with the Company's Audit & Finance Committee, among other things, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• methods to account for significant unusual transactions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates and the basis for the auditors' conclusions regarding  the reasonableness of those estimates; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• disagreements with management over the application of accounting principles, the basis for management's accounting estimates and the disclosures  in the financial statements.  
[END TABLE]
KPMG LLP also provided the Audit & Finance Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence). PCAOB Rule 3526 requires auditors annually to disclose in writing all relationships that in the auditor's professional opinion may reasonably be thought to bear on independence, confirm their perceived independence and engage in a discussion of independence. The Audit & Finance Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters disclosed in this communication and that firm's independence from Entegris. The Audit & Finance Committee also considered whether the provision of the audit related and tax services to Entegris by the independent registered public accounting firm, which are referred to under PROPOSAL 2 – RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 below, is compatible with maintaining such auditors' independence and concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm met the specified independence standards. 
Based on its discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and its review of the representations and information provided by management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit & Finance Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
In performing all of these functions, the Audit & Finance Committee acts only in an oversight capacity. The members of the Audit & Finance Committee have necessarily relied on the information, opinions, reports and statements presented to them by Entegris management, which has the primary responsibility for financial statements and reports. The members of the Audit & Finance Committee have also relied on the work and assurances of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, who in their report express an opinion on the Company's annual financial statements. Accordingly, while the Audit & Finance Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as described above, the foregoing oversight procedures do not assure that management has maintained adequate financial reporting processes and controls, that the financial statements are accurate, or that the audit would detect all inaccuracies or flaws in the Company's financial statements. The information set forth in this report of the Audit & Finance Committee is not "soliciting material", deemed to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not incorporated by reference into any filings of the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, irrespective of any general incorporation language contained in any such filing. 
AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE 
James P. Lederer, Chair 
Michael A. Bradley 
James F. Gentilcore 
Brian F. Sullivan  PROPOSAL 2 – RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), independent registered public accounting firm, has reported on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Audit & Finance Committee selected KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 and has also reviewed and approved the scope and nature of the services to be performed for Entegris by that firm. Representatives of KPMG are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting to make a statement if they wish to do so, and to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. The engagement agreement entered into with KPMG for fiscal year 2019 is subject to mediation and arbitration procedures as the sole method for resolving disputes. 
Ratification of the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the Audit & Finance Committee to be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the audit work of the independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Board of Directors is submitting this matter to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If the selection of KPMG is not ratified by the majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, the Audit & Finance Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, and may retain that firm or another firm without re-submitting the matter to the Company's stockholders. Even if stockholders vote in favor of ratification of the appointment, the Audit & Finance Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders. 
Representatives of KPMG regularly attend meetings of the Audit & Finance Committee. The Audit & Finance Committee pre-approves and reviews audit and non-audit services performed by KPMG as well as the fees charged by KPMG for such services. In its pre-approval and review of non-audit service fees, the Audit & Finance Committee considers, among other factors, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the auditors' independence. To avoid potential conflicts of interest in maintaining auditor independence, publicly traded companies are prohibited from obtaining certain non-audit services from its independent registered public accounting firm. In 2018 and 2017, we did not obtain any of these prohibited services from KPMG. Entegris uses other accounting firms for these types of non-audit services. For additional information concerning the Audit & Finance Committee and its activities with KPMG, see "Corporate Governance" and "Report of the Audit & Finance Committee" above. 
Audit Fees 
Aggregate fees for professional services rendered for the Company by KPMG for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were:

[END TABLE]
The Audit services for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of professional services rendered for the integrated audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; the statutory audits of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries; the review of the Company's interim consolidated financial statements in   quarterly reports to the SEC; incremental audit services in connection with our acquisition of SAES Pure Gas, a comfort letter in connection with our 2017 notes offering; a comfort letter in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility in 2018 and the services normally provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings with the SEC. 
The fees for Tax services for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were for tax matters relating to a management hub in Singapore and transfer pricing of the Company's products, services in response to tax reform, as well as for services related to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice for the Company. 
There were no fees for All Other services for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. 
The charter of the Audit & Finance Committee requires the pre-approval of all non-audit services before any such non-audit services are performed for the Company. The charter of the Audit & Finance Committee is posted on the Company's web site http://www.Entegris.com under "Investors – Corporate Governance". The Audit & Finance Committee adopted pre-approval policies and procedures with respect to audit and permissible non-audit services ("Services"). Under this policy, Services must receive either a general pre-approval or a specific pre-approval by the Audit & Finance Committee. The grant of a general pre-approval of Services is limited to identified Services that have been determined not to impair the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and must include a maximum fee level for the Services approved. A request for specific pre-approval must include detailed information concerning the scope of the Services and the fees to be charged. The policy also provides for a special delegation of pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Audit & Finance Committee where the commencement of Services is required prior to the next scheduled meeting of the Audit & Finance Committee and it is impractical to schedule a special meeting; any such pre-approval by the Chair is subject to review by the full Audit & Finance Committee. All of the fees listed as paid for 2018 and 2017 in the table above received pre-approval by the Company's Audit & Finance Committee. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF KPMG AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019.  PROPOSAL 3 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The following proposal gives our stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve or not approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, who are listed in the Summary Compensation Table above. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and our compensation philosophy, policies and practices, as disclosed under the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement. We are providing this vote as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed in the "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" section of this proxy statement, we are asking our stockholders to vote "FOR" the adoption of the following resolution: 
While we intend to carefully consider the voting results of this proposal, the final vote is advisory in nature and therefore not binding on us, our Board of Directors or the Management Development & Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors and the Management Development & Compensation Committee value the opinions of all of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE ADOPTION 
OF THE ABOVE RESOLUTION INDICATING APPROVAL OF THE
