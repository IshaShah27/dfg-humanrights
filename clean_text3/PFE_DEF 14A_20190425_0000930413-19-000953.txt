A message from   Pfizer's Lead   Independent   Director
Shantanu Narayen
Dear Shareholders:
On behalf of Pfizer's Board of Directors, thank you for your investment and continued confidence in the company and our Board. I am honored to serve as Lead Independent Director and to work closely with my fellow Directors as we serve on your behalf to carry out our fiduciary duty to oversee our company.
Management Succession Planning
The past year has been significant for the Board as we considered organizational changes, including a successful CEO transition. In September 2018, the Board elected Dr. Albert Bourla as CEO and elected Mr. Ian Read as Executive Chairman, effective January 1, 2019. The Board's unanimous decision was part of a thoughtful, multi-year succession planning process involving every independent member of the Board.
Ever since Dr. Bourla became Chief Operating Officer and joined the Board in early 2018, the Board has been continually impressed with his contributions at both the management and Board level, which helped affirm our decision that he is the right person to lead Pfizer at this time. We believe Dr. Bourla's deep experience at Pfizer, strong track record of success, and commitment to innovation will drive advancements across the company and enhance shareholder value.
Board Oversight of Strategy
Throughout 2018, the independent Directors worked closely with our leadership to ensure that the Board effectively oversaw Pfizer's strategy and operations. We regularly discussed significant business and organizational initiatives, our R&D pipeline, capital allocation, business development opportunities, enterprise risk management and corporate culture.
Notably, these conversations included sessions focused on our commitment to explore strategic options for the Consumer Healthcare business and to make a decision by year-end. After careful deliberation and a thorough review process, in December 2018 Pfizer announced an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline plc to form a new consumer healthcare joint venture. The Boards of Directors of both companies unanimously approved the transaction.
Evaluation of Board Leadership Structure
Each year during our evaluation of the Board's leadership structure, the independent Directors carefully consider whether to maintain a combined Chairman/CEO or to separate the positions of Chairman and CEO. The Board concluded that having Dr. Bourla as CEO and Mr. Read as Executive Chairman provides continuity of leadership during this time of transition, while maintaining the role of Lead Independent Director ensures that the independent Directors continue to have robust leadership in the boardroom.
It is important to the Board that we maintain the flexibility to select the leadership structure best suited to meet the needs of our business and shareholders at any given time. We will, of course, continue to evaluate the Board's leadership structure on an annual basis. In addition, as Lead Independent Director, I am responsible for leading the independent Directors' annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the Executive Chairman and of the CEO.
Board Refreshment
To ensure effective refreshment and proactively manage eventual vacancies on the Board due to upcoming retirements, the current Directors consider a diverse pool of qualified candidates who could potentially serve as Board members. We were pleased to announce in 2018 the elections of Dr. Dan Littman, a renowned immunologist and molecular biologist with achievements and recognition in both medicine and science, and Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer's current CEO.
Both candidates are excellent additions to the Board, further enhancing the diversity of backgrounds and expertise in the boardroom. Their elections were informed by the Board's continued focus on its composition and its annual evaluation process, which ensures the appropriate balance of skills, diversity, experience and tenure in light of our business needs.
After 13 years of service, Dr. Dennis Ausiello will retire from the Board and will not stand for re-election in 2019. We thank him for his service on the Board, and are grateful to have benefitted from his scientific expertise, valuable business insight and strong commitment to Pfizer and its shareholders.
In addition, as part of our ongoing commitment to proactive Committee refreshment, at the upcoming April 2019 Board Meeting, the Board will vote to elect Mr. Ronald Blaylock to the Audit Committee and Dr. Dan Littman to the Regulatory and Compliance Committee, contingent upon their election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Ongoing Commitment to Shareholder Engagement
In closing, the Board continues to prioritize engaging with shareholders and responding to your feedback. Members of the Board and senior management engaged with investors representing more than 30% of shares outstanding in 2018. As is detailed in this Proxy Statement, we covered a range of topics and the Board continues to use your input to inform our practices and policies.
We look forward to serving your interests in 2019 and beyond. Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Shantanu Narayen
Lead Independent Director

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
[END TABLE]
Chief Executive Officer Succession
In October 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors unanimously elected Dr. Albert Bourla, the company's Chief Operating Officer, to succeed Mr. Ian Read as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective January 1, 2019. Mr. Read was elected to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2019. Mr. Shantanu Narayen will continue in his role as Lead Independent Director. The Board believes this structure will help ensure continuity of strong and effective leadership.
The election of Dr. Bourla was the result of a multi-year succession planning process, led by the independent Directors. During this timeframe, the Board had the opportunity to observe and evaluate Dr. Bourla in many different settings, including as a Board member since February 2018. The Board was continually impressed with Dr. Bourla's business performance, depth of experience, proven leadership and track record for success and, therefore, elected him to lead the company into the future as CEO.
Board Composition
Our goal is to maintain a diverse Board representing a wide range of experience and perspectives, which are important to enhancing the Board's effectiveness in fulfilling its oversight role. Below we highlight the composition of our Director nominees.

2018 Shareholder Outreach
We believe that a robust shareholder outreach program is an essential component of maintaining our strong corporate governance practices. In our discussions with investors, we seek their input on a variety of corporate governance topics and other issues that may impact our business or reputation. We strive for a collaborative approach with investors to solicit and understand a variety of perspectives. During 2018, we solicited feedback from investors representing approximately 50% of our outstanding shares and engaged with more than 30 global institutional investors representing over 30% of our outstanding shares. Such engagement included the participation of the Chair of our Corporate Governance Committee when requested. Overall, investors' sentiment was positive with respect to our Board of Directors, our corporate governance practices, including the frequency of our shareholder outreach, and our executive compensation program. Shareholder feedback was summarized and shared with the Board of Directors.
Areas of particular focus during our engagements with investors included CEO succession planning, Board composition, with a focus on the recruitment process for new Director candidates, drug pricing, product safety, human capital management and the company's sustainability priorities.
For more information about our 2018 shareholder engagement program and the actions we took in response to shareholder feedback, see "Governance â Board Information â Corporate Governance Committee Report" and "Governance âShareholder Outreach" later in this Proxy Statement.
Executive Compensation Highlights
Pfizer's pay-for-performance compensation philosophy is set by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Our goal is to align each executive's compensation with Pfizer's short-term and long-term performance and provide the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives crucial to Pfizer's long-term success.

6   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Item 1 â Election of Directors
Eleven members of our Board are standing for re-election, to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders. A majority of the votes cast is required for the election of Directors in an uncontested election (which is the case for the election of Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting). A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a Director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. Our Corporate Governance Principles contain detailed procedures to be followed in the event that one or more Directors do not receive a majority of the votes cast "for" his or her election at the Annual Meeting.
Each nominee elected as a Director will continue in office until our next Annual Meeting and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or retirement.
We expect each nominee for election as a Director to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is not able to serve, the persons appointed by the Board of Directors and named as proxies in the proxy materials or, if applicable, their substitutes (the Proxy Committee) may vote their proxies for substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of Directors serving on the Board.
The Board has determined that all Director nominees (other than Mr. Ian C. Read and Dr. Albert Bourla) are independent of the company and management and meet Pfizer's criteria for independence (see "Director Independence" below).
Criteria for Board Membership
The Corporate Governance Committee focuses on Board succession planning on a continuous basis. In performing this function, the Committee recruits and recommends the nominees for election as Directors to the full Board of Directors. The goal is to achieve a Board that provides effective oversight of the company with the appropriate diversity of perspectives, experience, expertise, skills, specialized knowledge, and other qualifications and attributes of the individual Directors.
Important general criteria and considerations for Board membership include:

The Committee also considers, on an ongoing basis, the background, experience and skills of the incumbent Directors that are important to Pfizer's current and future business needs, including, among others, experience and skills in the following areas:
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   7
The Board and each Committee conduct rigorous annual evaluations to help ensure satisfaction of the criteria for Board membership (see "Evaluation of Board Effectiveness" below). Based on these activities and their review of the current composition of the Board, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board determined that the criteria for Board membership have been satisfied.
Selection of Candidates
Director Skill Set Considerations; Use of Matrix
In recruiting and selecting Board candidates, the Corporate Governance Committee takes into account the size of the Board and considers a skills matrix. This skills matrix helps the Committee determine whether a particular Board member or candidate possesses one or more of the skill sets, as well as whether those skills and/or other attributes qualify him or her for service on a particular committee. The Committee also considers a wide range of additional factors, including each Director's and candidate's projected retirement date, to assist in Board succession planning; other positions the Director or candidate holds, including other boards of directors on which he or she serves; the results of the Board and Committee evaluations; the company's current and future business needs; and the independence of each Director and candidate, to ensure that a substantial majority of the Board is independent. While the company does not have a formal policy on Board diversity, we believe the composition of the Board should be diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity, background, professional experience and perspectives.
Potential Director Candidates
On an ongoing basis, the Corporate Governance Committee considers potential Director candidates identified on its own initiative, as well as candidates referred or recommended to it by other Directors, members of management, search firms, shareholders and other sources (including individuals seeking to join the Board).
Shareholders who wish to recommend candidates may contact the Corporate Governance Committee as described in "How to Communicate with Our Directors" below. All candidates are required to meet the criteria outlined above, as well as those discussed under "Director Independence" below and in our Corporate Governance Principles and other governing documents, as applicable, as determined by the Corporate Governance Committee. Shareholder nominations must be made according to the procedures required under our By-laws (including via our proxy access by-law) and described in this Proxy Statement under the heading "Submitting Proxy Proposals and Director Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting." Shareholder-recommended candidates and shareholder nominees whose nominations comply with these procedures and who meet the criteria referred to above will be evaluated by the Corporate Governance Committee in the same manner as the Corporate Governance Committee's nominees.
Retirement Policy
Under Pfizer's Corporate Governance Principles, a Director is required to retire when he or she reaches age 73. A Director elected to the Board prior to his or her 73rd birthday may continue to serve until the annual shareholders meeting following his or her 73rd birthday. On the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board may waive this requirement as to any Director if it deems a waiver to be in the best interests of the company.

Governance
Overview
Pfizer is committed to exercising strong corporate governance practices. Good governance promotes the long-term interests of our shareholders, strengthens Board and management accountability and improves our standing as a trusted member of the communities we serve. We maintain and enhance our long record of excellence in corporate governance by regularly refining our corporate governance policies and procedures to reflect evolving practices and issues raised by our shareholders and other stakeholders.
Our governance structure and processes are guided by key governance documents, including our Corporate Governance Principles and Committee Charters, which govern the operation of the Board of Directors and its Committees in the execution of their responsibilities. The Principles are reviewed at least annually by the Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board and are updated periodically in response to changing regulatory requirements, evolving practices, issues raised by our shareholders and other stakeholders, and otherwise as circumstances warrant. Our Corporate Governance Principles are included as "Annex 1" to this Proxy Statement.
Board Information
Board Leadership Structure
The Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure to ensure both independent oversight of senior management and a highly engaged and high-functioning Board. Based on its experience, considerable engagement with shareholders, and an assessment of research on this issue, the Board understands that numerous viewpoints concerning a board's optimal leadership structure exist.
Given the dynamic and competitive environment in which we operate, the Board believes that the right leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. Under our By-laws and Corporate Governance Principles, the Board can and will change its leadership structure if it determines that doing so is appropriate and in the best interest of Pfizer and its shareholders at any given time. Consistent with this understanding, the independent Directors do not view any particular board leadership structure as preferred and consider the Board's leadership structure on at least an annual basis. This consideration includes the evaluation of alternative leadership structures in light of the company's current operating and governance environment, a review of peer company leadership structures, and investor feedback, with the goal of achieving the optimal model for Board leadership and effective oversight of senior leaders by the Board.
The Board recognizes that in circumstances where the positions of Chairman and CEO are combined or the Chairman is not independent, investors believe it is imperative that the Board elect a strong Lead Independent Director with a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities. Our Corporate Governance Principles align with the Board's goal of achieving the optimal model for Board leadership and investor preferences. See "Our Lead Independent Director" below.

    2018 Annual Review of Leadership Structure   Following a thorough review by the Corporate Governance Committee          and the independent Directors, the independent Directors most recently reconsidered the Board's leadership structure in September          2018 and determined that the positions of Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer would not be combined and that the role          of Lead Independent Director would continue to be held by Mr. Shantanu Narayen. Dr. Albert Bourla was elected Chief Executive Officer,          effective January 1, 2019. Dr. Bourla's election was the result of a vigorous multi-year management succession planning process          by the Board. Dr. Bourla succeeded Mr. Ian Read, who transitioned into the role of Executive Chairman on January 1, 2019. In this          role, Mr. Read focuses on the leadership of the Board, provides advice and counsel to the CEO and Executive Leadership Team, and          participates in selected engagements with government officials and key customers, as requested by the CEO. We believe that our          leadership structure is optimal at this time and will help ensure continuity of strong and effective leadership.

The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Management is responsible for assessing and managing risk, including through the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, subject to oversight by the Board. The ERM program provides a framework for risk identification and management. Each risk is assigned to a member or members, as appropriate, of our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) â the heads of our principal businesses and corporate functions. The Board believes that its leadership structure and the ERM program support the risk oversight function of the Board.
The Board executes its oversight responsibility for risk assessment and risk management directly and through its Committees:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Board considers significant enterprise risk topics, including,          among others, risks associated with our strategic plan, our capital structure, our research and development activities, and drug          pricing, access and reimbursement. In addition, the Board receives regular reports from members of our ELT that include discussions          of the risks involved in their respective areas of responsibility. The Board is routinely informed of developments that could affect          our risk profile or other aspects of our business.   The Board is kept informed of its Committees' risk oversight          and other activities through reports of the Committee Chairs to the full Board. These reports are presented at every regular Board          meeting.

The Board's Oversight of Company Strategy
The Board and its Committees are involved in overseeing our corporate strategy, including major business and organizational initiatives, capital allocation priorities and potential business development opportunities. The Board engages in discussions regarding our corporate strategy at nearly every Board meeting and, at least annually, receives a formal update on the company's short- and long-term objectives, including the company's operating plan and long-term corporate strategic plan. The Board's Committees oversee elements of our strategy associated with their respective areas of responsibility.
The Board's Oversight of Company Culture
Management establishes and reinforces the company's culture, which the Board and its Committees oversee. The Board recognizes the value of Pfizer's colleagues and the need for the company to build and sustain a culture where colleagues of diverse backgrounds and abilities contribute their unique viewpoints and perspectives to all aspects of the business. The PfizerVoice survey, conducted annually, is one way that the company measures colleague engagement on an anonymous basis. The results of this survey are reported to the Board annually and compared with results from prior years. The Board also meets with colleagues during annual site visits and attends an annual dinner with high performing colleagues.
The Board's Committees oversee elements of our culture associated with their respective areas of responsibility. The Compensation Committee is kept informed of Pfizer's compensation practices, including pay equity, through regular updates from Human Resources leaders. In addition, matters involving company culture, including steps taken to appropriately address matters such as inappropriate workplace behavior, harassment and retaliation, are routinely reported to the Audit Committee. The Regulatory and Compliance Committee, responsible for oversight of the company's Compliance Program, receives updates on the company's culture of integrity and the tone set by leaders throughout the organization.
The Board's Role in Succession Planning
MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION PLANNING
Succession planning for Pfizer's senior management positions, which ensures continuity of leadership over the long-term, is critical to the company's success. The Board is responsible for planning for CEO succession, as well as certain other senior management positions. The topic is discussed regularly in executive sessions. To assist the Board, the CEO annually provides the Board with an assessment of other senior managers and their potential to succeed him. The CEO also provides the Board with an assessment of persons considered potential successors to certain senior management positions.
As a result of the CEO succession planning process, in October 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors unanimously elected Dr. Albert Bourla, the company's Chief Operating Officer, to succeed Mr. Ian Read as CEO, effective January 1, 2019. Mr. Read was elected to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2019. Mr. Shantanu Narayen will continue in his role as Lead Independent Director. The Board believes this structure will help ensure continuity of strong and effective leadership.
The election of Dr. Bourla was the result of a multi-year succession planning process, led by the independent Directors. During this timeframe, the Board had the opportunity to observe and evaluate Dr. Bourla in many different settings, including as a Board member since February 2018. The Board was continually impressed with Dr. Bourla's business performance, depth of experience, proven leadership and track record for success and, therefore, elected him to lead the company into the future as CEO.
In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee will review periodically with the CEO the succession plans relating to positions held by elected corporate officers and will make recommendations to the Board with respect to the selection of individuals to hold these positions.
In October 2018, Pfizer announced the members of the ELT that report to Dr. Bourla, effective January 1, 2019.
BOARD SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Corporate Governance Committee focuses on Board succession planning on a continuous basis. In performing this function, the Committee is responsible for recruiting and recommending nominees for election as Directors to the full Board of Directors. The goal is to achieve a Board that provides effective oversight of the company with the appropriate diversity of perspectives, experience, expertise, skills, specialized knowledge, and other qualities and attributes of the individual Directors.

26   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Corporate Governance Committee Report
The Corporate Governance Committee seeks to maintain and enhance Pfizer's record of excellence in corporate governance by regularly reviewing and refining, when appropriate, Pfizer's corporate governance policies and practices. The following are examples of how we worked to achieve these objectives in 2018.
Board Leadership Structure: In connection with the multi-year CEO succession planning process, the Committee and the independent Directors conducted a thorough annual review of the Board's leadership structure. In connection with the election of Dr. Bourla as CEO, Mr. Read transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board and Mr. Narayen continued in his role as Lead Independent Director.
Board and Committee Matters; Director Evaluations: During 2018, we assessed Director qualifications for serving on various committees, assessed Director independence, conducted a comprehensive evaluation process for the Board and its Committees and recommended changes to the leadership and composition of certain committees. In addition, the Committee reviewed and, where appropriate, recommended changes to our governing documents, including certain Committee Charters, and continued to review the functioning of the Board and Committees to help ensure their effectiveness.
Recruitment and Assessment of Potential New Directors: In 2018, we continued an ongoing Board succession planning process to identify and assess potential Director candidates, based upon a skills matrix and other criteria. We considered a diverse pool of potential Director candidates based on recommendations provided by our Chairman and CEO, the independent Directors, management, external advisors and other resources. Resulting from this process, in March 2018, the Committee recommended and the Board elected Dr. Dan R. Littman as a Director and a member of the Corporate Governance and Science and Technology Committees. The Committee considered the election of Dr. Littman as a Director upon recommendation by certain Board members and evaluation by a third-party search firm. Among other qualifications, Dr. Littman brings significant depth of experience in medicine and science, healthcare and pharma and academia to the Board. We also considered unsolicited requests to join the Board.
Corporate Social Responsibility: At year-end, we received an update concerning the company's social investment strategy, progress on sustainability initiatives and external non-financial reporting trends. Further, we received an update on Pfizer's environmental sustainability initiatives and position on climate change.
Public Policy/Corporate Political Spending/Lobbying Activities: Under our Charter, we also maintain an informed status on company issues related to public policy, including political spending practices. We were informed of Pfizer's public policy and corporate political spending practices through periodic discussions and reviews of the company's annual Political Action Committee and Corporate Political Contributions Report. The Committee also received a report from management regarding the company's federal and state lobbying priorities and activities, including an overview of the benefits derived from the company's association with certain trade and other organizations, in accordance with our Charter.
Legislative and Regulatory Developments: We continued to monitor and evaluate corporate governance and executive compensation developments, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and NYSE listing standards through reports provided by management.
Shareholder Engagement:We engaged in reviews of shareholder and stakeholder communications at each of our meetings and were informed of shareholder feedback received during Pfizer's year-round investor outreach. The Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee, Mr. Joseph Echevarria, participated in discussions with several investors at their request. The Committee was also kept apprised of all shareholder proposals submitted during the proxy season and discussions with the proponents.

Regulatory and Compliance Committee Report
The Committee assists the Board of Directors with the oversight of significant healthcare-related regulatory and compliance issues. Under the terms of its Charter, the Committee receives reports regarding Pfizer's compliance program, for which management has primary responsibility.
In 2018, we received reports and discussed with management, including the Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer, significant healthcare-related regulatory and compliance risks and related compliance program initiatives, functions and risk management.
Among the matters considered were:
In our activities, we considered potential risks and steps Pfizer has taken to mitigate risk in areas within our oversight.

Shareholder Outreach
Connect
Engaging with investors is fundamental to our commitment to good governance and essential to maintaining our strong corporate governance practices. Throughout the year, we seek opportunities to connect with our investors to gain and share valuable insights into current and emerging global governance trends.
During 2018, we engaged with more than 30 global institutional investors representing over 30% of shares outstanding to discuss various corporate governance and related matters, including executive compensation, sustainability initiatives and other industry-specific issues. We also engaged with major proxy advisory firms. Those meetings were conducted in person, via teleconference or one-on-one at conferences throughout the year. Although shareholder outreach is primarily a function of management, members of the Board also participate when appropriate. In late 2018, Mr. Joseph Echevarria, Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee, met with several institutional investors to discuss, among other things, Board oversight of risk, drug pricing and executive compensation. In addition to speaking with our institutional investors, we are responsive to individual investors' and other stakeholders' inquiries.
Collaborate
We strive for a collaborative approach to shareholder outreach and value the variety of investors' perspectives received, which deepens our understanding of their interests and motivations and fosters a mutual understanding of governance priorities. Items on the meeting agendas covered a range of topics, including, but not limited to, those listed below.
Summary of Certain 2018 Shareholder Discussions
New Leadership Structure: The election of Dr. Albert Bourla as CEO and Mr. Ian Read as Executive Chairman was a key area of interest for many investors. Investors sought details about the succession planning process, the respective roles of the Executive Chair, CEO and Lead Independent Director, and in particular, how they will work together during this transition period. In addition, we received questions about Dr. Bourla's leadership style, background, expertise and views on corporate culture.
Action taken: This feedback was shared with the Board. We provided additional disclosure concerning the roles and responsibilities of the Executive Chair, CEO and Lead Independent Director in this Proxy Statement.
Board-related:Board composition continues to be of strong interest. Investors inquired about Board succession planning, both in terms of particular skills the Board is seeking, and its process and resources for identifying board candidates, especially qualified female candidates. We also received inquiries about the Board's annual evaluation process, including its consideration of third-party providers and use of individual Director evaluations in the process. Several investors inquired about Pfizer's policy regarding outside directorships and provided feedback on the maximum number of outside directorships they believe to be optimal. In general, investors were positive about the Board, including its mix of skill sets, tenure and diversity.
Action taken: This feedback was shared with the Board. See disclosures regarding Board composition, Board Committee refreshment and Director skills throughout this Proxy Statement.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   29
Risk Oversight:With respect to risk oversight, investors inquired about our overall ERM program. Several investors sought clarity about the specific roles of the Board and the Audit and Regulatory and Compliance Committees, as well as management, in the risk oversight process. Investors were interested in discussing Board and Committee oversight of risks related to reputation, drug pricing, product safety and human capital management. Questions were also asked about regular and emerging risk factors that the company considers most significant.
Action taken: This feedback was shared with the Board. In response, the disclosures concerning Board and Committee oversight of risks have been modified to provide greater clarity. See disclosures regarding risk oversight throughout this Proxy Statement.
Executive Compensation:During 2018, we engaged with investors to solicit comments and answer questions on our executive compensation program, our disclosures regarding the Compensation Committee's decision-making processes and recent trends/events related to executive compensation. Overall, investors continued to show support for our program and generally commented that they viewed it as aligned with performance and shareholder interests. Investors were interested in discussing the long-term components of our program and the various financial and operational performance metrics used in our short-term and long-term incentive plans.
Action taken: See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section later in this Proxy Statement.
Sustainability Factors:Investor interest in the company's sustainability priorities and reporting of non-financial performance metrics remains strong as they strive to gain a broader understanding of the company's strategic objectives. Some investors expressed interest in Pfizer's position on climate change and the use of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures reporting framework. Certain investors were interested in how the company and the Board of Directors monitor our corporate culture and human capital priorities. In terms of reporting on non-financial performance metrics, investors were generally positive about our reports and understanding of the challenges facing Pfizer and other companies to expand environmental and social performance disclosures.
Action taken: This feedback was shared with the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee receives an update at least annually on Pfizer's corporate responsibility initiatives. For additional information about the company's corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts, please see the "Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability" section later in this Proxy Statement and Pfizer's 2018 Annual Review at www.pfizer.com/annual. Please note that our 2018 Annual Review is not a part of our proxy solicitation materials. We also provide disclosure regarding Board and Committee oversight of company culture in "The Board's Oversight of Company Culture" section earlier in this Proxy Statement.

At least quarterly, we share investor and other stakeholder feedback directly with the Corporate Governance Committee. We view communication between our shareholders and the Board as a dialogue and, when appropriate, members of our Board engage directly with our shareholders.
We communicate with our shareholders through various platforms, including via our website, in print and in person at shareholder meetings or investor presentations. In 2018, in addition to meeting with institutional investors, we responded to more than 600 inquiries from individual shareholders sent to the Board of Directors or Corporate Secretary.

Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
Corporate responsibility and sustainability are integral to Pfizer's business strategy and our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen. We have always focused on delivering strong financial results, and we remain committed to doing so in a way that respects the communities and environments in which we operate.
We are actively engaged in a dialogue with investors around their interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance and the impact on financial results. Today, we strive to have these principles permeate Pfizer at every level â including our Board of Directors â which maintains oversight for these issues through the Corporate Governance Committee. The Committee maintains an informed status on our corporate social responsibility, sustainability and philanthropic efforts through regular updates from management.
We continue to evolve our approach to issues relevant to our business strategy, reputation and key stakeholders. For example, we are committed to helping achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2016. Pfizer supports the SDGs and works to align its scientific focus and corporate objectives to improve global public health impact and sustainable development. Achieving good health and well-being is integral to all 17 of the goals and is specifically addressed in Goal 3, which states that every person deserves access to quality healthcare.

Public Policy Engagement and Political Participation
BOARD OVERSIGHT
The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for maintaining an informed status on public policy and corporate political spending practices through periodic discussions and reviews of the company's annual Political Action Committee (PAC) and Corporate Political Contributions report. Management also informs the Committee of the company's lobbying priorities and activities through semi-annual reports, including a year-end report on lobbying priorities for the coming year.
ENGAGING IN PUBLIC POLICY
We operate in a highly regulated and competitive industry. It is fundamental to our business, our patients and our shareholders that we engage on public policy issues that may affect our ability to meet patients' needs and enhance shareholder value. These issues include advancing biomedical research and healthcare innovation; advocating for protecting intellectual property rights; and improving patient access to care. We regularly work with policy makers to help create and maintain an innovative environment where we can cultivate new medicines, bring them to market and ensure that patient health and safety remain a priority.
Pfizer is also a member of several industry and trade groups, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable. These organizations, along with the others to which we belong, represent both the pharmaceutical industry and the business community at large in an effort to bring about consensus on broad policy issues that can impact our business. Our support of these organizations is evaluated annually by the company's Government Affairs leaders based on these organizations' expertise in healthcare policy and advocacy and support of key issues of importance to Pfizer. In addition to their positions on healthcare policy issues, we realize these organizations may engage in a broad range of other issues that extend beyond the scope of issues of primary importance to Pfizer. If concerns arise about a particular issue, we are able to convey our concerns, as appropriate, through our colleagues who serve on the boards and committees of these groups. We believe there is value in making sure our positions on issues important to Pfizer and our industry are communicated and understood within those organizations. Pfizer's participation as a member of these groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with the positions of the organization and/or its members.

Employees are required to report any conduct that they believe to be an actual or apparent violation of Pfizer's policies on business conduct. Retaliation against any employee who seeks advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct, or provides information in an investigation is strictly prohibited. Our Audit Committee has procedures to receive, retain and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters and to allow for confidential and anonymous submissions by employees with concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.

Other Governance Practices and Policies
Director Independence
Our Board of Directors has adopted Director Qualification Standards (Standards) to evaluate and determine Director independence. Our Standards meet, and in some respects exceed, the independence requirements of the NYSE.
Director Qualification Standards. To qualify as independent under our Standards, a non-employee Director must have no material relationship with Pfizer other than as a Director. The Standards include strict guidelines for Directors and their immediate families regarding employment or affiliation with Pfizer or its independent registered public accounting firm; prohibitions against Audit Committee members having any direct or indirect financial relationship with Pfizer; considerations for evaluation of Compensation Committee member independence; and restrictions on both commercial and not-for-profit relationships between non-employee Directors and Pfizer. Directors may not receive personal loans or extensions of credit from Pfizer, must deal at arm's length with Pfizer and its subsidiaries, and must disclose any circumstance that might be perceived as a conflict of interest. Our Director Qualification Standards can be found on our website at https://investors.pfizer.com/corporate-governance/the-pfizer-board-policies/default.aspx.
Under our Standards, certain relationships and transactions are not considered to be material transactions that would impair a Director's independence, including the following:
In 2018, no indebtedness existed between Pfizer and any entity of which a Director or an immediate family member of a Director was an executive officer.
Drs. Ausiello, Hobbs and Littman are employed at medical or academic institutions with which Pfizer engages in ordinary-course business transactions. Mr. Narayen is the chief executive officer of Adobe Systems Incorporated and Mr. Smith is the chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters Corporation, companies with which Pfizer engages in ordinary-course business transactions. We reviewed our transactions with each of these entities and found that these transactions were made in the ordinary course of business and were below the levels set forth in our Standards (1% of the annual revenues of these entities in each of the last three years).
Under our Standards, contributions to not-for-profit entities in which a Director of the company, or a Director's spouse, serves as an executive officer, amounting to less than 2% of that organization's latest publicly available total revenues (or $1 million, whichever is greater), will not serve as a bar to the Director's independence. None of our Directors, or their spouses, is an executive officer of a not-for-profit organization to which Pfizer contributed in 2018. Nonetheless, a summary of charitable contributions to not-for-profit organizations with which our Directors or their spouses are affiliated was made available to the Corporate Governance Committee. None of the contributions approached the levels set forth in our Standards.
Independence Assessment. Together with Pfizer's legal counsel, the Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed the applicable legal and NYSE standards for Board and Committee member independence, as well as our Standards. A summary of the answers to annual questionnaires completed by each of the Directors and a report of transactions with Director-affiliated entities are also made available to the Committee. On the basis of this review, the Committee has delivered a report to the full Board of Directors, and the Board has made its independence determinations based upon the Committee's report and the supporting information.
The Board has determined that all of our current Directors (other than Mr. Ian C. Read and Dr. Albert Bourla) are independent of the company and its management and meet Pfizer's criteria for independence. The independent Directors are Drs. Dennis A. Ausiello, Helen H. Hobbs and Dan R. Littman; Ms. Suzanne Nora Johnson; and Messrs. Ronald E. Blaylock, W. Don Cornwell, Joseph J. Echevarria, James M. Kilts, Shantanu Narayen and James C. Smith. The Board has determined that Mr. Ian C. Read is not independent because of his employment as Pfizer's Executive Chairman and that Dr. Albert Bourla is not independent because of his employment as Pfizer's CEO.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   35
In making these determinations, the Board considered that, in the ordinary course of business, relationships and transactions may occur between Pfizer and its subsidiaries on the one hand and entities with which some of our Directors are or have been affiliated on the other.

Non-Employee Director Compensation
Our non-employee Directors receive cash compensation, as well as equity compensation in the form of Pfizer stock units, for their Board service.
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
In 2018, compensation for our non-employee Directors consisted of the following:
Our Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and advising on the compensation of our non-employee Directors. To assist with this duty, they have engaged an independent compensation consultant, FW Cook & Co., and specifically George Paulin, its Chairman, to perform periodic reviews of our non-employee Director compensation program, which includes an analysis of market trends and best practices and a comparison versus our Pharmaceutical Peer group and General Industry Comparator companies.
The compensation program for our non-employee directors was last revised in April 2018 upon recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee in consultation with FW Cook & Co. Under the Pfizer Inc. Nonfunded Deferred Compensation and Unit Award Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Unit Award Plan), other than as described below, during 2018, each Director received Pfizer stock units with a value of $192,500, as of the date of grant, upon election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, provided the Director continued to serve as a Director following the meeting. Prior to April 2018, when first elected to the Board, a new Director also received the full value of the Pfizer stock unit award grant under the Unit Award Plan at the time of his/her election. Accordingly, Dr. Littman received Pfizer stock units upon his election to the Board in 2018 with a value of $187,500, as of the date of the grant (which was the amount of the Pfizer stock unit grant under the Unit Award Plan at the time of his election).
In April 2018, the non-employee director compensation program was revised to provide that any new Director first elected to the Board after April 2018 will receive a pro-rata grant of Pfizer stock units having a value equal to the ratio of service as a Director during the year multiplied by $192,500, as of the date of grant. In 2019, each non-employee Director will receive Pfizer stock units with a value of $192,500, as of the date of grant, upon election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, provided the Director continues to serve as a Director following the meeting. Under the Pfizer Inc. 2014 Stock Plan, non-employee Directors may not receive grants that have a value of more than $500,000, as of the date of grant, in any 12-month period. If the 2019 Stock Plan is approved by shareholders at our 2019 Annual Meeting, the aggregate value of Pfizer stock units granted, plus cash retainer paid to a non-employee Director during a 12-month period, may not exceed $800,000.
Since Mr. Read remains an employee of the company, he does not receive the non-employee Director Compensation described above. Dr. Bourla does not receive any compensation for his service as a Director. For additional information regarding Mr. Read's compensation and Dr. Bourla's compensation, see the "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" section later in this Proxy Statement.
DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP
Non-employee Directors are required to own shares of Pfizer common stock having a value of at least five times their annual cash retainer, currently $712,500 worth of Pfizer stock. For purposes of satisfying this requirement, a Director's holdings include, in addition to shares held outright, units granted to the Director as compensation for Board service and shares or units held under a deferral or similar plan. A Director has five years from (a) the date of his or her first election as a Director, or (b) if later, the date of an increase in the amount of Pfizer stock required to be held, to satisfy this ownership requirement. We maintain policies that prohibit Directors from pledging Pfizer stock or engaging in activities considered to be hedging of our common stock, and none of our Directors has pledged Pfizer stock as collateral for personal loans or other obligations.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   37
2018 Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership
Shares held as a multiple of Annual Cash Retainer (dollar value of shares determined using Pfizer's closing stock price as of December 31, 2018).
DEFERRED COMPENSATION
Cash Compensation.Non-employee Directors may defer all or a part of their annual cash retainers under the Unit Award Plan until they cease to be members of the Board. At a Director's election, the cash retainer fees held in the Director's account can be credited with Pfizer stock units or deemed invested in the same investments available to Pfizer employees under certain deferred compensation plans. The number of Pfizer stock units is calculated by dividing the amount of the deferred fee by the closing price of Pfizer's common stock on the last business day of the fiscal quarter in which the fee is earned. If fees are deferred as Pfizer stock units, the number of stock units in a Director's account is increased by crediting additional stock units based on the value of any dividends on the common stock. When a Director ceases to be a member of the Board, the amount attributable to stock units held in his or her account is paid in cash or in shares of Pfizer stock, at the Director's election. The amount of any cash payment is determined by multiplying the number of Pfizer stock units in the account by the closing price of our common stock on the last business day before the payment date.
Equity Compensation.Directors who have met the stock ownership requirements as of December 31 of the prior year are permitted each year to elect to defer units granted in the immediately following year or to receive the units in shares. All of the eligible non-employee Directors will defer units granted in 2019. The number of deferred stock units in a Director's account is increased by crediting additional stock units based on the value of any dividends on the common stock. Units deferred are not payable until the Director ceases to be a member of the Board, at or after which time they are paid in cash or in shares of Pfizer stock, at the Director's election. The amount of any cash payment is determined by multiplying the number of Pfizer stock units in the account by the closing price of our common stock on the last business day before the payment date.
MATCHING GIFT PROGRAM
Our non-employee Directors may participate in the Pfizer Foundation Matching Gift Program, which is also available to all Pfizer employees. In 2018, under this program, the Pfizer Foundation(1) matched contributions to eligible Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, up to a maximum of $15,000 per year, per Director. Contributions to religious organizations, private foundations and organizations that do not accept donations from the Pfizer Foundation, as well as to individuals, are not eligible for a match. In addition, in 2018, the Pfizer Foundation matched contributions made through the Annual Giving Campaign, up to a maximum of $15,000 per year, per Director. Effective January 2019, the Pfizer Foundation will match donations up to $20,000 per year, inclusive of any donations made during the Annual Giving campaign.
The matching contributions made by the Pfizer Foundation with respect to our non-employee Directors are included in the 2018 Director Compensation Table below.

Beneficial Owners
Based on filings made under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2018, the only persons or entities known by us to be a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock were as follows:
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our Directors and certain of our officers to file reports of holdings and transactions in Pfizer equity with the SEC and the NYSE. Based on our records and other information, we believe that in 2018 our Directors and our officers who were subject to Section 16(a) met all applicable filing requirements.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   41
Related Person Transactions and Indemnification
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION APPROVAL POLICY
Pfizer has adopted a Related Person Transaction Approval Policy (the Policy) that is administered by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which Pfizer or a subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related person under the Policy has a direct or indirect material interest. Under the Policy, management determines whether a transaction requires review by the Corporate Governance Committee.
Transactions requiring review are referred to the Corporate Governance Committee for approval, ratification or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporate Governance Committee decides whether or not to approve such transactions and approves only those transactions that are deemed to be in the best interests of the company. If the company becomes aware of an existing transaction with a related person that has not been approved under this Policy, the matter is referred to the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. The Corporate Governance Committee then provides a summary of such transactions, including their terms, structure and business purpose, as well as the Corporate Governance Committee's approval decision, to the Audit Committee for their information.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
Following Dr. Ausiello's retirement from the Board, which is effective as of the 2019 Annual Meeting, the company is considering entering into a consulting agreement with Dr. Ausiello for his service as a science, medicine and biotech advisor to our Worldwide Research, Development and Medical organization from time to time. The transaction will be submitted to the Corporate Governance Committee for its approval, pursuant to the Policy, provided the consulting agreement is finalized.
INDEMNIFICATION
We indemnify our Directors and our elected officers to the fullest extent permitted by law so that they will be free from undue concern about personal liability in connection with their service to Pfizer. Our By-laws require indemnification, and we have also entered into agreements with those individuals that contractually obligate us to provide this indemnification to them.
42   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Item 2 â Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of Pfizer's independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee conducts a comprehensive annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence. The Committee considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm should be rotated and considers the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm. In evaluating and selecting the company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, historical and recent performance of the current independent audit firm, an analysis of known significant legal or regulatory proceedings related to the firm, external data on audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) reports, industry experience, audit fee revenues, firm capabilities and audit approach, and the independence and tenure of the audit firm.
The Audit Committee selected, and the Board of Directors ratified the selection of, KPMG LLP (KPMG) to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Pfizer's auditors have been KPMG and its predecessor firm, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., since 1987. Prior to that, Pfizer's auditors were Main Hurdman (until its acquisition by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. in 1987) and its predecessors. We have not been able to determine the specific year that Main Hurdman and its predecessor firms began serving as our auditor, however, we are aware that Main Hurdman and its predecessor firms have served as our auditor since at least 1942.
In accordance with SEC rules and KPMG policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide audit service to our company. For lead and concurring review audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the lead audit partner under this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of Pfizer and our shareholders, and we are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Although ratification is not required by our By-laws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG to our shareholders for ratification because we value our shareholders' views on Pfizer's independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event that our shareholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered a recommendation to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Pfizer and our shareholders.
See "GovernanceâBoard InformationâBoard CommitteesâThe Audit Committee" for additional information on the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm.
Representatives of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting to answer questions. They also will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.

Audit and Non-Audit Fees
The following table shows the fees for professional services rendered by KPMG for the audit of the company's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by KPMG during those periods.
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Consistent with requirements of the SEC and the PCAOB regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting the compensation of and overseeing the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.
Prior to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management submits for Audit Committee approval a list of services and related fees expected to be rendered during that year within each of four categories of services:
Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves independent registered public accounting firm services within each category, and the fees for each category are budgeted. The Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval categories. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The delegated member must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer's results and the assessment of Pfizer's internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer's financial statements, as well as, when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management represented to the Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.
In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor's independence from Pfizer and its management. As part of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from Pfizer.
We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor's independence. The Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.
As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer's Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.
The Committee discussed with Pfizer's Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of Pfizer's internal controls, and the overall quality of Pfizer's financial reporting and compliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in Pfizer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of Pfizer's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

Item 3 â 2019 Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee believes that Pfizer's executive compensation program is consistent with the goals of our executive compensation philosophy and that it drives performance, encourages an appropriate sensitivity to risk and increases shareholder value. This pay-for-performance philosophy is set by the Compensation Committee and is intended to align each executive's compensation with Pfizer's short-term and long-term performance and to provide the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain high-caliber executives who are crucial to Pfizer's long-term success.
A significant portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of our executives directly relates to Pfizer's total shareholder return and to other performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic and operating plans, as well as our pay levels compared with those of our Pharmaceutical Peer and General Industry Comparator groups. In making such comparisons, we consider company market capitalization and complexity as indicated by revenues, range of products, international operations and other factors because we use such factors in setting target levels of compensation and determining the value and levels of award opportunities.
We implement our pay-for-performance philosophy and achieve our program goals by following three key principles:
Results of 2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
Pfizer's executive compensation program received substantial shareholder support and was approved, on an advisory basis, by 92.6% of the votes cast at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Our Compensation Committee and the other members of our Board believe that this level of approval of our executive compensation program indicates our shareholders' strong support of our compensation philosophy and goals, and the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2017 and early 2018. The consistent high level of support from our shareholders for our executive compensation program over the past several years is a result of our Compensation Committee's commitment to compensating our executives in a manner that provides a strong link between pay and performance. We believe it is also reflective of our philosophy and goals, market best practices and strong shareholder engagement.
2018 Pay for Performance
During 2018, the company continued to deliver on our strategy, execute on our business plan and enhance shareholder value as we evolved to reflect the changing needs of our business, our patients and the pharmaceutical industry. We continued to strengthen our pipeline, advancing several significant pipeline programs and receiving seven key approvals from the FDA. We also enhanced shareholder value through prudent capital allocation decisions and delivered solid financial results. The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for 2018 is reasonable and appropriate, is aligned with the performance of our company and is working to ensure that our management's interests align with increasing shareholder value.
In deciding how to cast your vote on this proposal, the Board requests that you consider the structure of Pfizer's executive compensation program in connection with our 2018 performance, which is more fully discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section also contains more details about how we implement our philosophy and goals, and how we apply these principles to our compensation program. In particular, we discuss how we set compensation targets and other objectives and evaluate performance against those targets and objectives to ensure that performance is appropriately rewarded.

Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   47
Item 4 â Approval of the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan
On February 28, 2019, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (the Committee), the Board of Directors (the Board) approved the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan (the 2019 Plan), subject to shareholder approval at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The 2019 Plan will replace and supersede the 2014 Stock Plan (the Prior Plan). If the 2019 Plan is approved by our shareholders, it will become effective April 25, 2019 (the Effective Date). If approved, the maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will be 400,000,000, plus (i) the number of shares that remain available for issuance as of the Effective Date under the Prior Plan, and (ii) the number of shares that are subject to outstanding awards as of the Effective Date that, in the future, terminate, expire, or are forfeited, cancelled, or settled for cash. As of March 1, 2019, 111,031,948 shares remained available for grants under the Prior Plan, which is the only Pfizer plan under which equity-based compensation may currently be awarded to executives, other employees and non-employee Directors. After the Effective Date of the 2019 Plan, no awards will be granted under any other equity plans of the company.
In the opinion of the Committee and the Board, an increase in the number of shares available for grants is necessary as a part of our continuing commitment to attract, retain and motivate employees and to align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders.
The 400,000,000 shares of common stock newly reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan, plus the shares remaining available for grant under the Prior Plan as of the Effective Date (and any shares that come back to the share reserve in the event of expiration, forfeiture or cancellation), are expected to provide us with sufficient shares to cover the awards to be granted over the next four to five years. As discussed in further detail below, in determining the share reserve, the Committee and the Board took into account, among other things, our stock price and volatility, share usage, burn rate and dilution, the existing terms of our outstanding awards, and our fungible share counting ratio of 3:1 for full-share awards under the 2019 Plan.
We are also seeking approval of the 2019 Plan in order to: (i) comply with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules requiring stockholder approval of equity compensation plans; and (ii) allow the Compensation Committee to grant incentive stock options to employee participants in the 2019 Plan.
OVERVIEW
Equity-Based Compensation â Key Component of Compensation Program
Equity-based compensation is a key component of our total compensation package. As a worldwide biopharmaceutical company, attracting, retaining and motivating specialized talent is critical to achieving our strategic and operating goals, including our goal to increase shareholder value.
Highlights of the Plan and Best Practices
The Plan and our other related governance practices and policies contain provisions that are consistent with the interests of our shareholders and with our corporate governance practices. In addition, the company maintains a no hedging or pledging policy.

KEY DATA
The following table includes information regarding outstanding equity awards and shares available for future awards under the company's equity plans as of December 31, 2018 (and without giving effect to approval of the 2019 Plan or the February 28, 2019 annual grant).
USAGE OF SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR GRANT
Overhang
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 525 million shares of our common stock subject to outstanding equity awards or available for future equity awards under the Prior Plan, which represented approximately 8% of diluted common shares outstanding (or "overhang percentage"). The 400 million new shares proposed to be included in the 2019 Plan share reserve would increase the overhang percentage by an additional 6% to approximately 14%.
Share Usage and Burn Rate
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   49
REASONS FOR SEEKING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
We use equity compensation as a key tool for the attraction, retention and motivation of the best available talent. If shareholder approval is not obtained, we will continue to operate under the terms of the Prior Plan. We anticipate that we will exhaust the current reserve of shares under the Prior Plan after making our normal annual grants of equity awards in 2020, depending upon the stock price.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLAN
The following is a summary of the principal features of the 2019 Plan. This summary is not a complete description of all of the provisions of the 2019 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2019 Plan, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as "Annex 2".
Purpose
The general purpose of the 2019 Plan is to allow Pfizer to continue to utilize equity awards to attract, retain and motivate employees and to further align the interests of our employees with those of Pfizer's shareholders. Non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, TSRUs, SARs, RSUs, performance awards, performance share awards (PSAs), portfolio performance shares (PPSs) and other stock unit awards may be granted under the 2019 Plan.
Administration and Duration
The selection of employee participants in the 2019 Plan and the level of participation of each employee participant will be determined by the Compensation Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee will make such determinations as to any grants to non-employee Directors. The Compensation Committee may delegate any or all of its authority to administer the 2019 Plan as it deems appropriate, except that no delegation may be made to an employee of Pfizer in the case of awards made to individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The 2019 Plan will terminate on April 24, 2029, unless terminated earlier by the Board or the Compensation Committee.
Plan Benefits
Future grants will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, or in the case of awards to non-employee Directors, the Corporate Governance Committee, and accordingly, future benefits under the 2019 Plan are not currently determinable. However, the 2019 awards granted to executive officers and all other employees would not have been increased if they had been made under the proposed 2019 Plan, rather than under the Prior Plan. The 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table appearing elsewhere in this Proxy Statement show the awards that were made under the Prior Plan in 2018 to our NEOs. As discussed herein under "Non-Employee Director Compensation," each person who is serving as a non-employee Director of the company following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be granted an award of Pfizer stock units with a grant date dollar value equal to $192,500, which would result in the grant of stock units with an aggregate grant date dollar value of $1,732,500 if all non-employee Director nominees receive an award following the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Additionally, the following table shows the number of shares subject to awards granted under the 2014 Plan on February 22, 2018 (as part of our annual long-term incentive award cycle) to members of our Executive Leadership Team (the ELT) (including the CEO), other senior executives and members of our senior management team (the ELTI) and other employees (All Others).
Shares Subject to the Plan; Share Counting
Subject to adjustments for changes in capitalization, a total of 400,000,000 shares will be authorized for grant pursuant to awards under the 2019 Plan, plus the number of shares that remain available for grant as of the Effective Date under the Prior Plan, and the number of shares that are subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plan as of the Effective Date that terminate, expire, or are forfeited, cancelled, or settled for cash. The 2019 Plan provides that awards other than stock options and SARs/TSRUs will be counted against the 2019 Plan maximum in a 3-to-1 ratio. For example, if we grant an award of 100 RSUs and 100 PSAs, we would reduce the shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan by 300 shares and 600 shares, respectively.
50   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Any shares that terminate, expire, or are forfeited, cancelled or settled in cash, may be used for the future grant of awards to the extent of such termination, expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or settlement. Any shares that again become available for future grants shall be added back as one (1) share for options or TSRUs or SARs, and as three (3) shares for awards other than options, TSRUs or SARs, including in each case with respect to awards granted under the Prior Plan. Shares subject to awards under the 2019 Plan or an award under the Prior Plan that is outstanding on the Effective Date may not again be made available for issuance or delivery if such shares are (i) shares that were subject to a stock-settled TSRU/SAR and were not issued upon the net settlement or net exercise of such TSRU/SAR, (ii) shares delivered or withheld by the company to pay the exercise price of an option, (iii) shares delivered to or withheld by the company to pay the withholding taxes related to an award, (iv) shares withheld by the company in connection with the net settlement of an award, or (v) shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an option exercise.
The shares to be delivered under the 2019 Plan will be made available from authorized but unissued shares of Pfizer common stock, from treasury shares and/or from shares purchased in the open market or otherwise.
Limitations on Awards under the 2019 Plan
During the term of the 2019 Plan, no individual may be granted stock options, TSRUs, SARs, performance-based or other equity awards covering more than twenty million (20,000,000) shares during any consecutive 36-month period. The same ratio for counting awards against the maximum number of authorized shares also applies for counting awards to individuals against this limit.
No participant under the 2019 Plan will be paid a performance cash award in any calendar year in an amount in excess of $20,000,000.
No more than 400,000,000 shares may be granted as incentive stock options under the 2019 Plan.
Certain of the foregoing limits were included because of the historic inclusion under the Prior Plan (so that the awards may be considered performance-based under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code)) and have not been removed under the 2019 Plan notwithstanding the repeal of the performance-based exceptions to the limitation on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code. The limitations are not intended to reflect an intention to grant awards at such levels.
As noted above in the section entitled "Non-Employee Director Compensation," pursuant to the 2019 Plan, the dollar value of equity awards and/or the cash retainer that may be granted to any one non-employee Director under the 2019 Plan or otherwise is limited to an aggregate value (at grant) of $800,000 in any consecutive 12-month period.
Eligibility
All employees of the company and its affiliates, as well as the company's non-employee Directors, are eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan. From time to time, the Compensation Committee will determine who will be granted awards, and the number of shares subject to such grants. As of February 25, 2019, approximately 34,066 persons (including 34,042 employees, 14 executive officers and 10 non-employee Directors) were eligible under the current criteria to receive awards under the 2019 Plan.
Minimum Vesting Period
The 2019 Plan prescribes a minimum vesting period of at least twelve months for an award, provided that the Compensation Committee may grant awards without regard to the foregoing minimum requirement with respect to up to five percent (5%) of the shares subject to the 2019 Plan described above. Any substitute awards, cash-denominated awards and awards to non-employee Directors that vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of shareholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding annual meeting are excluded from such minimum vesting period.
No Dividends or Dividend Equivalents on Unvested Awards
Notwithstanding any provision of the 2019 Plan to the contrary, dividends, dividend equivalents and dividend equivalent units will only be paid if, and to the extent, the underlying award vests, regardless of whether vesting is contingent upon the achievement of performance goals or time.
Prohibition on Repricing
The 2019 Plan does not permit the repricing of options, TSRUs or SARs, or the exchange of underwater options, TSRUs or SARs for cash or stock/units, and options, TSRUs and SARs may not be granted at a discount to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date (with an exercise price lower than the fair market value) without shareholder approval. The limited circumstance of the assumption or substitution of awards in a transaction that involves the adjustment of awards in order to preserve aggregate value would not be considered a repricing for this purpose.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   51
Transferability
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, awards granted under the 2019 Plan may not be transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution and, during his or her lifetime, any options or awards may be exercised only by the participant or his/her estate. The 2019 Plan explicitly prohibits the transfer of awards to third parties for consideration.
Certain Adjustments
In the event of any change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock of the company by reason of a recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, separation, liquidation, stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, combination of shares or any other change in the corporate structure or shares of stock of the company, an appropriate adjustment will be made consistent with applicable provisions of the Code and Treasury Department rulings and regulations, and as the Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion deems equitable or appropriate, including:
Change in Control
Unless the Compensation Committee or the Board determines otherwise at the time of grant, in the event a participant's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause during the 24-month period following a change in control:
Additionally, the Compensation Committee or the Board may provide for awards to be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in connection with a change in control. However, if the option price per share under any outstanding option is equal to or greater than the price per share in the change in control, or the value (change in stock price plus projected dividend equivalents) of any outstanding TSRU or SAR is negative, the Board may cancel such award without the payment of any consideration.
Recoupment Policy
Awards under the 2019 Plan are subject to the company's policies on recoupment of gains realized from any awards as may be in effect from time to time. All awards granted under the 2019 Plan will be subject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the company's securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law.
Amendment and Revocation
The Board may amend or revoke the 2019 Plan, but may not, without prior approval of our shareholders:
Additionally, the Board may not take any action with respect to an affected participant without such participant's consent if the action would materially impair the participant's rights under any outstanding award.
52   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
TYPES OF AWARDS
Stock Options
Options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either non-qualified stock options or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Code. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date the option is granted. On February 28, 2019, the closing price of our shares traded on the NYSE, as published in the Wall Street Journal, was $43.35 per share.
The option price is payable in cash or, if the grant provides, in common stock. Generally, all options terminate after a 10-year period from the date of the grant. The 2019 Plan also provides for the automatic exercise of options that are due to expire in the event that the option price is less than the fair market value of the underlying shares.
The Compensation Committee determines the terms of each stock option grant at the time of the grant.
Total Shareholder Return Units / Stock Appreciation Rights
A TSRU or SAR represents a right to receive the excess of (i) the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date of the settlement pursuant to the terms of the grant plus dividends, if applicable, over (ii) the grant price of the right on the grant date, as specified by the Compensation Committee. TSRUs and SARs may, but need not, be granted in tandem with options. The Compensation Committee determines the terms of each TSRU/SAR at the time of the grant. Any freestanding TSRU/SAR may not be granted with a grant price that is less than the fair market value of the stock on the date the TSRU/SAR is granted and cannot have a term longer than 10 years. Distributions to the recipient may be made in common stock, in cash or in a combination of both as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Restricted Stock Awards
Restricted stock is stock issued with such contingencies or restrictions as the Compensation Committee may impose. Until the conditions or contingencies are satisfied or lapse, the stock is subject to forfeiture. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, a recipient of a restricted stock award has the same voting, dividend and other rights as holders of common stock, except that the 2019 Plan prohibits the payment of dividends on unearned/unvested awards. If the participant ceases to be an employee before the end of the contingency or restricted period, the award is forfeited, subject to such exceptions as authorized by the Compensation Committee.
Restricted Stock Units
An RSU is an award of a right to receive, in cash or shares, as the Compensation Committee may determine, the fair market value of one share of Pfizer common stock, on such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may determine.
Performance-Based Awards
The 2019 Plan has been designed to permit the Compensation Committee to grant performance-based awards that are earned subject to the achievement of set performance goals, including PSAs, PPSs, performance cash awards and other awards/units. A performance award may be in any form of award permitted under the 2019 Plan. The Compensation Committee may select periods during which performance criteria chosen by the Committee are measured for the purpose of determining the extent to which a performance award has been earned. The Compensation Committee decides whether the performance levels have been achieved, what amount of the award will be paid and the form of payment, which may be cash, stock or other property or any combination. The 2019 Plan has also been designed to permit the grant of performance-based awards that are denominated in cash.
Performance goals may be based on the achievement of specified levels of company performance (or performance of an applicable unit or division of the company) under one or more of the measures described in the 2019 Plan, relative to the performance of other corporations or comparable businesses, and may provide for the inclusion or exclusion of specified extraordinary, nonrecurring charges.
As described in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis under "Tax Policies," the exception from the Section 162(m) $1.0 million deduction limit for qualified "performance-based" compensation paid to certain covered executive officers has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. From such effective time of the changes to Section 162(m), the company is no longer able to grant qualified performance-based compensation, other than where transition relief may apply.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   53
U.S. TAX TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND AWARDS
The following is a summary of the effect of U.S. federal income taxation on the participants in the 2019 Plan and the company. This summary does not discuss the income tax laws of any other jurisdiction (including U.S. state or local jurisdiction) in which the recipient of the award may reside.
Incentive Stock Options
An incentive stock option results in neither taxable income to the optionee, nor a deduction to the company at the time it is granted or exercised. If the optionee holds the stock received as a result of an exercise of an incentive stock option for at least two years from the date of the grant and one year from the date of exercise, then the gain realized on disposition of the stock is treated as a long-term capital gain. If the shares are disposed of during this period, however (i.e., a "disqualifying disposition"), then the optionee will include the income, as ordinary compensation for the year of the disposition, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares, upon exercise of the option over the option price (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized upon disposition over the option price). The excess, if any, of the sale price over the fair market value on the date of exercise will be a short-term capital gain. In such case, the company will be entitled to a deduction, in the year of such a disposition, for the amount includible in the optionee's income as compensation, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code. The optionee's tax basis in the shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option is equal to the option price paid, plus any amount includible in his or her income as a result of a disqualifying disposition.
Non-Qualified Stock Options
A non-qualified stock option results in no taxable income to the optionee or deduction to the company at the time it is granted. An optionee exercising a non-qualified stock option will, at that time, realize taxable compensation in the amount of the excess of the then market value of the shares over the option price. Subject to the applicable provisions of the Code, including Section 162(m), a deduction for federal income tax purposes will be allowable to the company in the year of exercise in an amount equal to the taxable compensation realized by the optionee. The optionee's tax basis in shares received upon exercise is equal to the sum of the option price plus the amount includible in his or her income as compensation upon exercise.
Any gain (or loss) upon subsequent disposition of the shares will be a long- or short-term gain (or loss), depending upon the holding period of the shares.
If a non-qualified stock option is exercised by tendering previously owned shares of the company's common stock in payment of the option price, then, instead of the treatment described above, the following will apply: a number of new shares equal to the number of previously owned shares tendered will be considered to have been received in a tax-free exchange; the optionee's basis and holding period for such number of new shares will be equal to the basis and holding period of the previously owned shares exchanged. The optionee will have compensation income equal to the fair market value on the date of exercise of the number of new shares received in excess of such number of exchanged shares; the optionee's basis in such excess shares will be equal to the amount of such compensation income; and the holding period in such shares will begin on the date of exercise.
Total Shareholder Return Units / Stock Appreciation Rights
Generally, the recipient of a stand-alone TSRU/SAR will not recognize taxable income at the time the stand-alone TSRU/SAR is granted.
If an employee receives the appreciation inherent in the TSRU/SAR (change in stock price plus dividends from grant date to settlement date) in cash, the cash will be taxed as ordinary income to the employee at the time it is received. If an employee receives the appreciation inherent in the TSRU/SAR in stock, the value is converted into stock which is taxable as ordinary income at the fair market value of the stock.
In general, there will be no federal income tax deduction allowed to the company upon the grant or termination of TSRU/SARs. However, upon the settlement of a TSRU/SAR, the company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income the recipient is required to recognize as a result of the settlement, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code.
Restricted Stock Awards / Performance Stock Awards
No income will be recognized at the time of grant by the recipient of a restricted stock award or performance stock award while such award is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Generally, at the time the substantial risk of forfeiture terminates with respect to a stock award, the then fair market value of the stock awarded will constitute ordinary income to the employee. Subject to the applicable provisions of Section 162(m), a deduction for federal income tax purposes will be allowable to the company in an amount equal to the compensation realized by the employee.
54   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Other Awards
In the case of an award of RSUs, performance awards, dividend equivalents or dividend equivalent units or other stock or cash awards, the recipient will generally recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to any cash received and the fair market value of any shares received on the date of payment or delivery. In that taxable year, the company will receive a federal income tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income which the recipient has recognized, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code.

The grant and exercise of options and awards under the 2019 Plan to non-employee Directors and to employees outside the U.S. may be taxed on a different basis.

Executive Summary
Our Organization Changes: Organizing for Future Growth
Effective with the beginning of the company's 2019 fiscal year, our commercial business operations are now positioned in the following organizational structure:
[BEGIN TABLE]

We re-aligned our commercial operations in 2019 for a number of reasons, including:
We believe this new structure better positions each business to achieve its growth potential as we transition to a period post-2020 where we expect higher and more sustained revenue growth due to declining LOEs and the potential of our late-stage pipeline.
LEADERSHIP TRANSITION
On October 1, 2018, Pfizer announced that the Board unanimously elected Dr. Albert Bourla, our then COO, to succeed Mr. Ian Read as CEO, effective January 1, 2019, and that Mr. Read would serve as Executive Chairman of Pfizer's Board of Directors.
The changes were the result of a multi-year succession planning process led by the independent Directors, during which the Board had the opportunity to observe and evaluate Dr. Bourla in many different settings, including as a Board member since February 2018. The Board also decided that maintaining a governance structure that includes an Executive Chairman and a strong Lead Independent Director is optimal at this time and will help ensure continuity of strong and effective leadership. Mr. Shantanu Narayen, who became our Lead Independent Director in April 2018, will continue as the company's Lead Independent Director. Our Board determined this leadership structure to be appropriate for the company at this time, as it allows for Dr. Bourla to continue to focus on the day-to-day operations of the company, advance Pfizer's long-term strategy and deliver the next growth phase of Pfizer. Dr. Bourla has developed an extensive knowledge of the industry over his 25-year career at Pfizer and has demonstrated an ability to build and grow the business.
Mr. Read's deep knowledge of the business and governmental affairs, as well as the relationships he has built with our shareholders, patients and policy makers, will ensure leadership continuity at the Board level and assist the Board with oversight of management during the leadership transition period.
Mr. Read's key responsibilities as Executive Chairman will include Board leadership, input on key matters that relate to Pfizer's long-term growth strategy, government affairs, shareholder engagement (as requested by the CEO) and serving as an advisor to Dr. Bourla during the leadership transition period to help ensure an orderly and successful business transition.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
Annually, the Compensation Committee performs a comprehensive review of our executive compensation program to ensure the program is aligned with our long-term business strategy, drives performance and reflects shareholder engagement and feedback, as appropriate. As part of this review, the Committee's independent compensation consultant provides the Committee with a review of executive compensation trends and best practices, as well as any relevant regulatory updates that may impact our short- and long-term executive compensation programs. The Committee uses this information to form decisions on executive compensation and to validate the link between pay and performance.
Based on the Committee's annual review and in response to changing business needs and market best practices, the Committee took the following actions to enhance our executive compensation program. The following are key compensation actions taken in 2018:

Pfizer's Executive Compensation Program
Pfizer's executive compensation program is designed to strengthen the link between pay and performance. We deliver the majority of our NEOs' compensation in the form of performance-based awards. A significant percentage of total target compensation is "at-risk" through both our short- and long-term incentive awards. These awards are linked to actual performance and include a substantial percentage of compensation in the form of performance-based equity awards.

Pfizer's Pay-for-Performance Philosophy
The Committee believes that Pfizer's pay-for-performance executive compensation program is consistent with the goals of its executive compensation philosophy to drive performance and increase shareholder value. This philosophy, set by the Committee, aligns each executive's compensation with Pfizer's short- and long-term performance and provides the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives crucial to Pfizer's long-term success. A significant portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of our executives (including the NEOs) is directly related to Pfizer's total shareholder return (TSR) and to other performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic and operating plans. We also benchmark our performance against that of our Pharmaceutical Peer group and General Industry Comparators with consideration of company market capitalization and complexity as indicated by revenues, range of products, international operations and other factors. We use these factors in setting target levels of compensation and determining the value and level of award opportunities.

 Our executive compensation pay-for-performance principles include:â¢ positioning total direct compensation and each compensation element at approximately the median          of our Pharmaceutical Peer and General Industry Comparator companies, with consideration of relative company market capitalization          and complexity;â¢ aligning annual incentive awards with annual operating, financial and strategic objectives;          andâ¢ rewarding absolute and relative performance in TSR through long-term equity incentive awards.

2018 NEO Pay Mix
Our program consists of three key components: salary, annual short-term and long-term incentive awards.
2018 NEO Total Direct Compensation (TDC)
TDC is the sum of base salary, annual bonus earned for the performance year, and annual long-term incentive grants attributable to the performance year. This "performance-year" approach is used by our Committee to determine TDC competitiveness versus peers, and to evaluate the alignment of annual pay and performance. However, performance-year TDC differs from the amount reported in the Summary Compensation Table (SCT) as the amount for equity grants in the SCT reflects the grants made during the year for which applicable performance goals have been set under GAAP rules, and the performance-year TDC calculation includes the value of the annual long-term incentive grant, attributable to the performance year, without regard to when the annual LTI performance goal is established.

CEO 2018 COMPENSATION
The graph below illustrates and compares the three main components of Mr. Read's 2017 and 2018 Performance-Year TDC and the amounts reflected in the SCT. The graph is not intended as a substitute for the SCT.
2018 Performance Year. The 2018 performance year TDC ($13.0 million) represents an approximate 26% decrease year-over-year from the 2017 performance-year TDC ($17.6 million), reflecting a decrease in the annual LTI award value as a result of Mr. Read's shift from Chairman and CEO to Executive Chairman (effective January 1, 2019); offset in part by a higher bonus of $3.0 million (compared to 2017 performance year bonus of $2.6 million).
2018 SCT. The two main differentials between the 2018 SCT TDC ($18.9 million) and the 2018 performance year TDC ($13.0 million) are the following:

Compensation Practices
COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT
Pfizer continues to implement and maintain leading practices in its compensation program, shareholder outreach and related areas. We conduct an annual comprehensive assessment of potential risks related to our compensation program, policies and practices.
Executive Compensation Program. An assessment is conducted annually by FW Cook & Co., the Committee's independent advisor. The assessment focuses on (1) having an appropriate balance in our program structure to mitigate compensation-related risk with cash versus stock, short-term versus long-term measurement and financial versus non-financial goals; and (2) best-practice policies to mitigate compensation-related risk including recovery/clawbacks, stock ownership guidelines, equity administration rules, and insider-trading and hedging prohibitions.
Global Compensation Programs. An assessment of our compensation programs globally is designed with outside counsel and conducted annually by management and reviewed by the Committee's independent advisor. The assessment includes the evaluation of our global incentive plans and commission plans, and takes into consideration the plan metrics, plan participation rates, recovery/clawback provisions and other risk-mitigation factors, as well as the maximum potential payouts.
LEADING COMPENSATION PRACTICES
2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation and Shareholder Outreach Program
HISTORICAL ADVISORY VOTES
Pfizer's executive compensation program has received strong shareholder support over the past several years. At the 2018 and 2017 Annual Meetings, Pfizer's executive compensation program received support of 92.6% and 93.6% of the votes cast, respectively. Our Committee and the other members of our Board believe this consistent high level of support from our shareholders is a result of our commitment to ensure a strong link between pay and performance.

    Robust 2018 Shareholder Outreach Program   Pfizer is committed to open and continued communication with our shareholders.          In 2018, we continued our longstanding robust investor outreach program to solicit valuable feedback on a variety of topics, as          well as to understand their perspectives on Pfizer's executive compensation program, our decision-making processes, our disclosure          and recent trends/events, all of which were shared with the Committee and the Board. This outreach program ensures that the Committee          and Board gain valuable insight into our shareholders' views about the company, its pay and governance practices. In addition,          shareholder engagement is a valuable tool to gather insight about the issues that matter most to our shareholders so Pfizer can          address them effectively.   We solicited feedback from investors representing approximately 50%          of our outstanding shares and engaged with more than 30 global institutional investors representing over 30% of our outstanding          shares. Investor feedback was generally positive regarding our executive compensation programs and its link between pay and performance.          The Committee and Board value our shareholders' insight and will continue to seek their input on an ongoing basis throughout          the year.

2018 Executive Compensation Program Summary (cont'd)
SECTION 1 â Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program
2018 Salaries
Salary is a fixed amount of compensation for performing day-to-day responsibilities. Salary represented approximately 11% of total direct compensation (year-end salary, target annual incentive and target annual long-term incentive) for the CEO and approximately 19% for the other NEOs. Base salaries for the NEOs are reviewed on an annual basis and in connection with a promotion and/or other changes in responsibilities.
The table below shows the annual salaries for our NEOs set by the Committee, effective April 1, 2018.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   / Annual Incentive Award Program/Global Performance Plan (GPP)
The Compensation Committee determines the annual incentive bonus percentage funding based on performance against three pre-set weighted financial goals that are based on Pfizer's annual operating plan. Achievement versus our pre-set goals is measured using the same key operating assumptions as those in our annual budget.*

Financial Results for Annual Incentive Purposes
The annual incentive program was funded at 109% as we exceeded the 2018 target goals for Adjusted Diluted EPS and Cash Flow from Operations while we fell slightly below the target goal for Total Revenue. The Committee also considered the company's outstanding performance with respect to the pipeline in setting the funding level. The Committee set the target goals for annual incentive purposes in the first quarter of 2018, utilizing a budgeting approach that considered prior year's performance, expected growth, the impact of business development activity, losses of exclusivity and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Committee then determined that a sufficient degree of stretch existed in the targets (See "Process for Determining Annual Incentive Pool Funding" on page 70 for additional information).
These results are different than our results under GAAP. See "Financial Measures" on page 106 for a comparison of U.S. GAAP numbers to these objectives for annual incentive purposes.
2018 Financial Objectives (for Annual Incentive Purposes)
The table below provides a comparison of 2017 Results with 2018 Threshold, Target and Results.
For more information on revenues see "Revenues â Overview" on page 20 in the 2018 Financial Report.
2018 TARGET SETTING FOR ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARD OPPORTUNITY
The target annual incentive award opportunity for our NEOs represents a percentage of a salary grade midpoint which is set based on market data. The use of midpoints provides uniformity of annual bonus targets as all individuals in the same salary grade have the same target bonus. This reduces the impact of compounding the differences in salary when bonus targets are based on a percentage of actual salary. Target annual incentive award levels are reviewed annually to ensure alignment with our compensation philosophy of targeting each compensation element and total direct compensation to approximately the market median, and with consideration of internal equity among our ELT members.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   71
2018 ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS
In February 2019, the Committee determined the annual incentive awards for the NEOs for 2018 performance:
Annual incentive award targets and payout ranges for 2018, as well as the actual annual incentive award payouts for each of the NEOs, are:
2018 Annual Long-Term Incentive Award Program (Equity)
Our annual long-term incentive awards are structured to align our executives' interests with the interests of our shareholders. The Committee expects our executive officers to focus their efforts on Pfizer's long-term performance and its shareholder value creation:
72   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Pfizer's annual long-term incentive compensation for our NEOs (and the other ELT members) is delivered entirely in the form of performance-based equity awards using two vehicles that incentivize long-term value creation:
2018 Grant Value of Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards
The 2018 grant value of each NEO's annual long-term incentive award was set by the Committee based on competitive market data (targeted to median), relative duties and responsibilities, the individual's future advancement potential, the individual's impact on Pfizer's results and for retention purposes.
These grant values, which differ from the accounting values shown in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table," were as follows:
Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs)
TSRUs, which deliver value based on absolute total shareholder return, vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and settle on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant date, as applicable. The settlement value equals the difference between the settlement price and the grant price (both as described below), plus dividend equivalents accumulated during the term. The grant price is the closing stock price on the date of grant ($35.74 for the TSRUs granted on February 22, 2018), and the settlement price is the 20-day average of the closing prices ending on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant. The settlement value is delivered in shares of Pfizer common stock.

Performance Share Awards (PSAs)
The PSA performance is measured against two metrics: (1) operating income (OI)(1) over three one-year periods; and (2) relative TSR as compared to the DRG Index over the three-year performance period.
The chart below provides the details of the PSA program and the Committee's rationale for its decisions regarding the features of the PSAs:

SECTION 2 â How We Determine Executive Compensation
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, determines the compensation for each of our executives (including the NEOs) and oversees the design and administration of Pfizer's executive compensation program. Each year, the Committee reviews and considers a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the executive compensation program, including the elements of each NEO's compensation, with input from the Committee's independent compensation consultant. The independent members of the Board review all decisions by the Committee relating to the compensation of our executives.

In 2018, the Committee continued to retain the firm of FW Cook & Co., represented by George Paulin, its Chairman, as the Committee's independent compensation consultant. They advise the Committee on executive compensation matters in accordance with our policy on criteria and assessment of the firm's independence. Generally, these services can include: advising the Committee on our executive compensation program, philosophy and evolving industry practices; providing market information and analysis regarding the competitiveness of our program design; reviewing our peer groups; evaluating management proposals and our specific awards; and reviewing other compensation amounts for appropriateness and in relationship to company performance.
In 2018, as part of his ongoing services to the Committee, Mr. Paulin attended five of the six Committee meetings held during the year. As he was unable to attend one of the scheduled meetings, he provided his feedback prior to the meeting.
During 2018, Mr. Paulin, in addition to providing guidance before and during the Committee meetings, advised the Committee on all compensation matters it considered and advised on various executive pay topics, including the impact of legislative and regulatory developments related to compensation and performance target setting, benchmarked executive positions, and performed a risk analysis of the company's executive compensation policies and programs. With respect to the CEO succession process, Mr. Paulin advised the Committee and other Board members on matters relating to the new CEO and Executive Chairman positions based on his experiences with similar transitions along with recent market data including compensation levels for each position.
Fees Paid. The total amount of fees paid to FW Cook & Co. in 2018 for services provided to the Compensation Committee was $208,514. The Committee also reimburses FW Cook & Co. for Mr. Paulin's reasonable travel and business expenses. In addition, FW Cook & Co. serves as the independent advisor to the Corporate Governance Committee regarding non-employee Director compensation matters, as appropriate, and received fees of $22,645 in 2018 for this work.
How We Establish Targets
Total target direct compensation for each executive is set at approximately the 50th percentile of the market as defined by our Pharmaceutical Peers and General Industry Comparators. A significant portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of our executives (including the NEOs) is directly related to Pfizer's total shareholder return and to other performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic and operating plans, as well as our performance against that of our Pharmaceutical Peers and General Industry Comparators. In making such comparisons, the Committee considers company market capitalization and complexity, as indicated by revenues, range of products, international operations and other factors, because the Committee uses such factors in setting target levels of compensation and determining the value and level of award opportunities.
On an annual basis, the Committee reviews the total compensation opportunity of each NEO (as well as the other ELT members). This includes cash compensation (salary and target annual incentive) and target annual long-term incentive compensation, as well as perquisites, retirement benefits and health and insurance benefits. The Committee, with the advice of its independent compensation consultant, then sets each NEO's compensation target for the current year. This generally involves establishing an annual incentive opportunity and a long-term incentive award. Regular salary adjustments, if any, typically become effective on April 1 of each year. The Committee's decisions are reviewed and ratified by the independent members of the Board.

Our 2018 Peer Groups â Competitive Pay Positioning
We recognize that while some information is available on the performance of our non-U.S.-based peer companies, the compensation data can be limited in terms of comparable benchmarks and other information compared to peers with U.S. pay models. Using the companies in both groups provides a good balance and increases the amount of comparable compensation data available to perform our annual benchmarking analysis. Both groups are used as they are also a source of talent for Pfizer, and have complex businesses, as well as the availability of comparative data. We review these groups annually to determine if any changes are necessary. In 2018, the Committee reduced the number of general industry comparators to 19 from 21 by eliminating Express Scripts and Microsoft as a result of a then pending and now completed merger and a different pay model, respectively.

Linking Pay and Performance
This section highlights the Committee's key compensation decisions for 2018 based on the Committee's review of each NEO's performance and annual assessment and advice from its independent compensation consultant, FW Cook & Co.
SETTING PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
The performance objectives for our NEOs reflect the goals the Committee believes our executives should focus on during the year in order to achieve Pfizer's business goals, including financial, operating and/or strategic plans. Progress against these objectives is monitored and reviewed during the year. The Committee recognizes that increasing TSR should be emphasized; however, they also acknowledge that performance against this objective may not be reflected in a single 12-month period.

DETERMINING 2018 AWARDS
For 2018, the Committee reviewed the annual incentive funding matrix, and found that the funding ranges corresponding to their respective performance levels and their relative relationship were appropriate. The Committee also concluded that the degree of difficulty of the targets (and other points on the matrix) was appropriately challenging while being reasonable, given the business environment and related factors. The Committee also reviewed the target levels for the annual long-term incentive awards and concluded that they were appropriate and did not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.
PAYING FOR PERFORMANCE
The Committee made decisions about individual compensation elements and total compensation using its judgment, advice from its independent compensation consultant, and input from the CEO (in the case of the other NEOs), focusing primarily on each NEO's performance against his individual financial and strategic objectives and other performance factors, as illustrated in the "2018 NEO Performance Summaries", as well as Pfizer's overall performance. The Committee also considered a variety of qualitative factors, including the business environment in which the results were achieved. The Committee determined each NEO's compensation based on multiple factors, including the competitive market, individual performance, internal equity and affordability. The Committee took into consideration the key individual accomplishments described below, which were also important factors in assessing the respective NEO's performance for 2018.

Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   83
Salary and Annual Incentive Targets
The Committee approved salaries and 2019 target annual incentive award levels which are based on a percentage of salary midpoints for the NEOs as follows:
2019 Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards
In February 2019, the Committee granted long-term incentive awards to the NEOs in consideration of their 2018 performance and their expected future performance. These awards included 50% of the award value granted as 5- and 7-Year TSRUs and the remaining 50% granted as PSAs.
NOTE: Consistent with historical practice, long-term incentive award values are converted into units using the closing stock price/value on the first trading day of the week of grant. The PSA values were converted to units using the closing stock price on February 25, 2019 of $43.08. The 5-Year TSRU values were converted to TSRUs using $8.31 and the 7-Year TSRU values were converted to TSRUs using $9.86, representing the estimated value at grant using the Monte Carlo Simulation model as of February 25, 2019.
EQUITY AWARD GRANT PRACTICES
The Committee customarily approves equity awards to eligible employees, including the NEOs, at its meeting held in late February of each year and the awards are ratified by the independent members of the Board and granted as of the day of ratification. Equity grants to certain newly hired employees, including executive officers, are effective on the last business day of the month of hire. Special equity grants to continuing employees are effective on the last business day of the month in which the award is approved. TSRU and stock option grants have an exercise/grant price equal to the closing market price of Pfizer's common stock on the grant date. Our equity incentive plan prohibits the repricing or exchange/cash out of equity awards without shareholder approval.

 Insurance Plans  Provide health and family security benefits, such as medical insurance,          dental insurance, life insurance and long-term disability insurance.    Programs are designed to provide certain basic quality of life benefits          and protections to Pfizer employees, including the NEOs, and at the same time enhance Pfizer's attractiveness as an employer          of choice.   The cost of these plans is shared between the employee and the company.          The company's annual cost of the benefit coverage for each NEO ranges from approximately $20,000 to $29,000, based on the          coverage selected. 
 Deferred Compensation  Executives are permitted to elect to defer receipt of their annual          incentive awards and any shares earned under the PSAs into the Pfizer Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP).    Annual incentive awards may be deferred under one or more of the          following plans: Pfizer Savings Plan (PSP), the Pfizer Supplemental Savings Plan (PSSP) and/or DCP. Deferrals into the DCP and          PSSP may be notionally invested and deferrals into the PSP may be invested in a selection of mutual funds, Pfizer stock and/or          a cash equivalent fund (DCP only).   The Pfizer stock unit funds are credited with dividends, which are          reinvested into dividend equivalent units or other investments. Deferred RSUs required to be deferred in 2016 and later may only          be deferred into the Pfizer stock fund.

Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   85
SECTION 6 â Other Compensation Programs and Policies
PERQUISITES
We provide a limited number of perquisites to our ELT members (including the NEOs): limited personal use of company aircraft, reimbursement for certain financial counseling and home security services. The transportation benefits provide increased efficiencies and allow more productive use of our executives' time and, in turn, greater focus on Pfizer-related activities. The Committee believes these perquisites are consistent with market practice and contribute to executive security, recruitment and retention.
We do not provide tax "gross-ups" for perquisites provided to the NEOs, except in the case of certain relocation expenses (consistent with our relocation policy for U.S.-based employees generally). Therefore, executives (including the NEOs) pay taxes due on perquisites (other than certain relocation expenses). The Committee reviews and carefully considers the reasonableness of and rationale for providing these perquisites.

86   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
The amounts for perquisites disclosed in the "All Other Compensation" column and in the table below have been valued based on the incremental costs to the company for the personal use of company-provided aircraft. Incremental costs for personal use consist of the variable costs incurred by Pfizer to operate the aircraft for such use. Such costs do not include fixed or non-variable costs that would be incurred whether or not there was any personal use of the aircraft, such as crew salaries and benefits, insurance costs, aircraft purchase costs, depreciation, and scheduled maintenance.
2018 Incremental Cost of Perquisites
The following table summarizes the incremental cost of perquisites for the NEOs in 2018.
Tax Policies
Prior to 2018, IRC Section 162(m) generally limited to $1.0 million the amount of non-performance-based remuneration that Pfizer could deduct in any calendar year for certain executive officers. We structured our annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards with the intention of meeting the exception to this limitation for "performance-based" compensation, as defined in IRC Section 162(m), so that these amounts could be fully deductible for income tax purposes.
To maintain flexibility and the ability to pay competitive compensation, we do not require all compensation to be deductible. Historically, since the non-performance-based compensation paid to our NEOs has exceeded $1.0 million, in prior years, a portion of their compensation has not been deductible.
Effective January 1, 2018, the exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation was repealed, such that compensation paid to our NEOs (including non-grandfathered performance based compensation) in excess of $1.0 million is not deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The company will utilize the transition relief provisions for eligible compensation to the extent possible. We will continue to maintain flexibility and the ability to pay competitive compensation by not requiring all compensation to be deductible.
Derivatives Trading/Hedging Policy
Executive officers, including the NEOs, may not purchase or sell options on Pfizer common stock or engage in short sales of Pfizer common stock. Also, trading by executive officers in puts, calls, straddles, equity swaps or other derivative securities that are directly linked to Pfizer common stock (sometimes referred to as "hedging") is prohibited. These provisions also apply to our non-employee Directors.
Compensation Recovery/Clawback
The Compensation Committee may, if permitted by law, make retroactive adjustments to any cash- or equity-based incentive compensation paid to NEOs and other executives in the event of any accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under federal securities law. Where applicable, we will seek to recover any amount the Committee determines to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive officer.
In addition, our equity and cash incentive awards contain compensation recovery/clawback provisions that authorize the cancellation and reduction of outstanding awards and the return of shares or cash paid or gain realized from an award, if the NEOs, other executives or employees: (i) engage in any activity in competition with the company; (ii) engage in any activity inimical, contrary or harmful to the interests of the company (or directly supervise any employee who engages in such activity) or that violates any company policies; or (iii) disclose or misuse any confidential information or material concerning the company.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   87
Furthermore, in accordance with the terms of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee's (RCC) Charter, if there is a government or regulatory action that, in the judgment of the RCC, has caused significant financial or reputational damage to the company or otherwise indicates a significant compliance or regulatory issue within the company, then the RCC shall make a written recommendation to the Compensation Committee concerning the extent, if any, to which the incentive-based compensation of any executive, senior manager, compliance personnel and/or attorney involved in the conduct at issue or with direct supervision over an employee that engaged in the conduct at issue should be reduced, extinguished, or recovered.
The company will disclose its decision to take action when required by, and in compliance with, SEC rules and regulations and other applicable laws. In addition, when legally permissible to do so, the company will disclose a decision to take action when the facts and circumstances of the matter have been publicly disclosed in the company's filings with the SEC and where disclosure can be made without prejudicing the company and its shareholders.
These recovery/clawback policies are in addition to any policies or recovery rights provided under applicable law.
Stock Ownership and Holding Requirements
Our NEOs are subject to stock ownership and holding requirements. Employee directors (CEO and COO for 2018 and Executive Chairman and CEO beginning in 2019) are required to own Pfizer common stock equal in value to at least six times their annual salary. Each of the other NEOs is required to own Pfizer common stock equal in value to at least four times their annual salary. For purposes of these requirements, ownership includes not only shares owned directly by the NEO, but also shares and certain units held through various Pfizer plans and programs. We have also established milestone guidelines that we use to monitor progress toward meeting these targets over a five-year period, at the end of which the executive is expected to have reached the applicable ownership level.
Until an NEO reaches the applicable milestone, he must hold and may not sell any shares (except to meet tax withholding obligations). Once the ownership level is met, NEOs must hold and may not sell shares if doing so would cause ownership to fall below that level. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Read and Dr. Bourla owned Pfizer common stock and units equal in value to approximately 19x and 7x times their respective salaries. We believe that these holding requirements align the interests of our NEOs with those of our shareholders. Additionally, certain long-term incentive awards continue to vest and settle in accordance with their stated terms following an NEO's retirement, rather than vesting upon retirement, maintaining the alignment with shareholders into retirement.
2018 STOCK OWNERSHIP(1)
Note: Consistent with our policy prohibiting the pledging of Pfizer stock, none of our NEOs or other executive officers has pledged Pfizer stock as collateral for personal loans or other obligations.

GENERAL
Contributions to the Pension Plan are made entirely by Pfizer and are paid into a trust fund from which benefits are paid. Under the Pension Plan (which was frozen on December 31, 2017), the amount of annual earnings that may be considered in calculating benefits and the maximum annual pension benefit is limited by law. Under the Supplemental Plans (also frozen on December 31, 2017), Pfizer provides, out of its general assets, amounts substantially equal to the difference between the amount that would have been paid in the absence of these IRC limits and the amount that may be paid under the Pension Plan. The Supplemental Plans are non-funded; however, in certain circumstances Pfizer has established and funded trusts to secure obligations under the Supplemental Plans. In 2015, for eligible active participants, an offer was made to allow a one-time election of a notional transfer of the post-2004 Supplemental Pension Plan benefit to the Pfizer Supplemental Savings Plan (PSSP) effective January 2016. Mr. Read was eligible for the offer and chose to elect the transfer which was in the amount of $30,992,370. It represents a transfer amount of $26,964,478 in January 2016, with the remaining amount of $4,027,892 transferred in March 2016. By electing the notional transfer, Mr. Read ceased participating in the Pension Plan effective December 31, 2015. The remaining benefit not transferred is unchanged and will be payable to him consistent with the terms of the plan. The change in pension value reported in the SCT represents the impact of interest rates and mortality on his remaining benefit. The Board policy on pension benefits for Executives will be applied as if the notional transfer had not been made (discussed later in this Proxy Statement).
98   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
The present value of accumulated benefits has been computed based on the assumptions as of December 31, 2018 in the following table, which was used in developing our financial statement disclosures:
PENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS(1)
For the purpose of computing the Lump Sum Values shown in the Pension Benefits Table, lump sum interest rates as of January 1, 2019 are 3.21% for annuity payments expected to be made during the first 5 years, 4.26% for payments after 5 and up to 20 years, and 4.55% for payments made after 20 years. For the portion of the Wyeth formula benefit accrued prior to January 1, 2012, the lump sum assumption as of January 1, 2019 is based on the Unisex 1994 Group Annuity Mortality table blended 50% Male and 50% Female, and an interest rate of 1.50%, which is 120% of the November 2018 immediate PBGC lump sum interest rate used to calculate lump sums during the first quarter of 2019.
EARLY RETIREMENT PROVISIONS
Under the Pension Plan and Supplemental Plan, the normal retirement age is 65. Under the PRAP Sub-Plan, if a participant terminates employment with an age and years of service combination equal to or greater than 90, the employee is entitled to receive either an annuity or an equivalent lump sum that is unreduced under the terms of the Pension Plan or the Supplemental Pension Plan for early payment. Mr. Read attained this milestone during 2010. Under the PRAP Sub-Plan, if an employee retires on or after age 55 with 10 or more years of service, that participant may elect to receive either an early retirement annuity or lump sum payment, reduced by 4% per year (prorated for partial years) for each year between benefit commencement and age 65. If an employee does not satisfy any of the above criteria and has three years of vesting service under the Pension Plan, that participant may elect to receive an annuity starting on or after age 55, reduced by 6% per year for each year (prorated for partial years) prior to age 65, or beginning in 2019, an immediate annuity or lump sum actuarially reduced to the age at distribution, if elected within a six month window after termination.
BOARD POLICY ON PENSION BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES
The Board has a policy to seek shareholder approval prior to the payment of amounts to any senior executive from the company's defined benefit pension plans if his or her benefit, computed as a single life annuity, will exceed 100% of the senior executive's final average salary, as calculated at the discretion of the Committee. This policy applies to all benefit accruals after
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   99
January 1, 2006. For purposes of this policy, "final average salary" means the average of the highest five calendar years' earnings (as defined by the Committee and not based on the legacy pension plan definition), where earnings include salary earned during the year and annual cash incentives (or bonus) earned for the year. This policy will be applied as if the notional transfer of certain supplemental benefits had not been made.
2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table(1)
This table summarizes activity during 2018 and account balances in our various non-qualified savings and deferral plans for our NEOs. The following plans permit the executives to defer eligible earnings on a pre-tax basis: Pfizer Supplemental Savings Plan (PSSP) and DCP. Other than employer contributions to the PSSP, the account balances in these plans are generally attributable to deferrals of previously earned compensation and the earnings on those amounts. In addition to employee deferrals, the PSSP has two types of company contributionsâa company matching contribution and the RSC described in more detail below. The PSSP is a non-qualified supplemental savings plan that provides for the deferral of compensation that otherwise could have been deferred under the related tax-qualified savings plan (PSP) but for the application of certain IRC limitations, plus company matching contributions based on the executive's contributions and the RSC. In addition, the PSSP accepts the transfer of Post-2004 Supplemental Pension Plan benefits into the plan and are treated as re-deferrals as required by IRC Section 409A. Effective January 1, 2018, generally all eligible U.S. based colleagues (including the NEOs) are eligible to participate in the RSC.

Pfizer Savings Plans
GENERAL
The company provides the PSP and the PSSP to U.S.-based employees who meet the eligibility requirements. Employer contribution amounts are reflected in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" or prior years' summary compensation tables, as applicable. Note that investment earnings have not been included in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table".
For 2018, the tax law limits:
SAVINGS PLAN (PSP)
The Savings Plan is a tax-qualified retirement savings plan. Participating employees may contribute up to 30% of "regular earnings" on a before-tax basis, Roth 401(k) basis and after-tax basis, into their Savings Plan accounts, subject to tax law limitations. "Regular earnings" for the Savings Plan includes both salary and bonus. In addition, under the Savings Plan, we generally match an amount equal to one dollar for each dollar contributed by participating employees on the first 3% of their regular earnings, and 50 cents for each additional dollar contributed on the next 3% of their regular earnings. Matching contributions, which are immediately vested, are paid at the end of each quarter provided the employee is employed at the end of each quarter, unless the employee terminated employment due to retirement, death or disability.
In addition to the matching contributions, effective January 1, 2018, following the freeze of the U.S. Pension Plan, generally all Savings Plan participants (including all NEOs) became eligible to participate in the RSC. The RSC is an age- and service-weighted annual company contribution that varies from 5% to 9% of "regular earnings". For 2018 RSC contributions, regular earnings do not include bonus payments made in 2018 (for 2017 performance year), as these bonus payments were considered eligible compensation in the Pension Plan and Supplemental Plans. The RSC is invested in the same fund options selected by the employee for his/her contributions. The RSC vests upon three years of service and is made only if the employee is employed on December 31st of the respective year, unless the employee terminated employment due to retirement, death or disability.
SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS PLAN (PSSP)
The PSSP is intended to provide crediting of company contributions equal to the difference between the amount actually allocated under the PSP and the amount that would have been allocated to an employee's account, if the limits described in the preceding paragraphs under "Pfizer Savings PlansâGeneral" did not exist. Under the PSSP, participants can elect to defer up to 30% regular earnings on a before-tax basis. Generally, under the PSSP, contributions plus earnings are paid out of general assets of the company. Participants can elect to receive payments as a lump sum or in 2 to 20 annual installments following termination from service. Participants who do not make an election receive a lump sum payment. In certain circumstances, we have established and funded rabbi trusts to meet our obligations under the PSSP.
In addition, prior to 2012, Dr. Dolsten participated in the Wyeth Supplemental Employee Savings Plan (Wyeth SESP), an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental savings plan. In certain circumstances, we have established and funded rabbi trusts to meet our obligations under the Wyeth SESP.
Amounts deferred, if any, under the PSSP by the NEOs for 2018 are included in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table". In the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table", PSSP values (including the legacy Wyeth SESP values for Dr. Dolsten) are shown for each NEO. Executive contributions reflect the percentage of salary and bonus the executive has elected to defer under the PSSP. Matching contributions and RSC are shown in the "Pfizer Contributions" column of the table. For the NEOs, the company's matching contributions and RSC, if applicable, under the Savings Plan and the PSSP are also shown in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table". The "Aggregate Earnings" column for the PSSP in the above table represents the amount by which the PSSP (including the legacy Wyeth SESP for Dr. Dolsten) balances changed in the past fiscal year, net of employee and employer contributions.

CEO PAY RATIO
As required in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, Pfizer is required to disclose the ratio of the CEO's annual total compensation to that of the median-paid employee. Further to this requirement, under the disclosure Instructions 2 to Item 402(u), the median-paid employee may be identified once every three years if there is no significant impact to the pay ratio disclosure. As there were no significant changes in our employee population or to the median-paid employee's compensation arrangements in 2018 that would significantly affect the pay ratio disclosure, the employee representing the median-paid employee is the same employee selected for the 2018 Proxy Statement.
The 2018 annual total compensation for Mr. Read was $19,549,213, which is approximately 244 times the annual total compensation of the median-paid employee whose 2018 total compensation was $80,011. The annual total compensation (determined using the requirements for the SCT) consists of salary, bonus, equity and all other compensation. As the median-paid employee was located outside of the U.S., the annual total compensation was converted to USD using the spot exchange rate as of the last business day of the year (December 31, 2018).
As previously reported in the 2018 Proxy Statement, we applied the following steps to identify the median-paid employee:

This table provides certain information as of December 31, 2018, with respect to our equity compensation plans:
Equity Compensation Plan Information
On October 15, 2009, Pfizer acquired Wyeth and assumed the Wyeth Management Incentive Plan (the MIP Plan), pursuant to which no subsequent awards have been or will be made. As of December 31, 2018, 4,087 Pfizer shares were issuable in settlement of the participants' accounts, which are delivered in lump sums and installments upon separation from Pfizer, subject to meeting the requirements of the MIP Plan. Information regarding these shares is not included in the above table.

Financial Measures
The following table contains a comparison of 2018 and 2017 U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP revenues and U.S. GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for annual incentive purposes relating to "Financial Results for Annual Incentive Purposes" within this Proxy Statement (Unaudited). These financial measures for annual incentive purposes utilize budget exchange rates and, therefore, are different from those utilized in our press releases and the Financial Review section in our 2018 Financial Report.

Shareholder Proposals
We expect the following proposals (Items 5-8 on the proxy card) to be presented by shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The proposals may contain assertions about Pfizer or other statements that we believe are incorrect. We have not attempted to refute all of these inaccuracies. However, the Board of Directors has recommended a vote AGAINST these proposals for broader policy reasons described in the "Your Company's Response" section following each proposal.
Mr. Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY, 11021, who represents that he owns no less than 300 shares of Pfizer common stock, has notified Pfizer that he will present the following proposal at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
The Shareholder's Resolution
Proposal 5 - Right to Act by Written Consent
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any valid topic for written.
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if all Allstate and Sprint shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.
A shareholder right to act by written consent and to call a special meeting are 2 complimentary ways to bring an important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. More than 100 Fortune 500 companies provide for shareholders to call special meetings and to act by written consent.
Written consent is also a means to elect a director who could focus on avoiding reoccurrences of events like these:
Class Action Lawsuits over alleged antitrust claims, Epipen.   October 2018
Criticism over alleged tax evasion through shifting profits into tax havens, Oxfam America. Report   September 2018
Lawsuits over alleged heightened risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, Lipitor.   August 2018
DOJ Investigation into alleged payment of bribes to the Ministry of Health of lraq.   August 2018
DOJ Investigation into shortage of intravenous solutions.   July 2018
$23 Million settlement to resolve allegations of using charities in violation of the False Claims Act.   May 2018
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management. Our Directors and management will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus be more alert in avoiding poor performance.
Please vote yes:
Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 5
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   107
Your Company's Response
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. The Board believes that the actions requested by the proponent are unnecessary and not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. A shareholder proposal regarding written consent has been voted on by Pfizer's shareholders at previous Annual Meetings and, each time, the proposal has not received a majority of shareholder support.
PFIZER'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES STRONG BOARD ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUPPORTS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The Board has regularly demonstrated our responsiveness and accountability to our shareholders' concerns through our industry-leading corporate governance practices. In 2017, the Board of Directors amended the company's special meetings by-law to reduce the percentage of outstanding stock required for shareholders to call a special meeting from 20% to 10%. The Board took this action as a result of Pfizer's commitment to corporate governance excellence, a philosophy of responsiveness to investor feedback and the significant minority support received at the 2017 Annual Meeting for a shareholder resolution requesting a 10% ownership threshold. In a similar vein, following discussions with various institutional shareholders, in 2015, the Board amended Pfizer's By-laws to allow for "proxy access" for director nominations, provided that the shareholders and the nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the by-laws.
The Board understands that some shareholders view the ability to act by written consent to be an important right. However, the Board believes that Pfizer's by-law provisions governing the ability to call special meetings offer shareholders a formal and more equitable opportunity, including notice and disclosure to all shareholders, to conduct matters rather than enabling a limited group of shareholders to act by written consent.
YOUR BOARD IS DEDICATED TO ENGAGING WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND LISTENING TO THEIR PERSPECTIVES
Pfizer regards its relationships with shareholders and other stakeholders as fundamental to its strong corporate governance practices. The company regularly engages in discussions with investors, investor advocates and key opinion leaders on a broad variety of governance issues, including the desirability of permitting shareholders to act by written consent.
The Board strongly believes that important matters requiring a shareholder vote should be the subject of shareholder meetings, which provide the opportunity for discussion and interaction among the company's shareholders so that all points of view may be considered prior to a vote. The right to act by written consent could potentially disenfranchise some shareholders and deprive them of this opportunity to carefully consider matters that are important to Pfizer, while presenting an opportunity for special interest investors to improperly push for proposals that are not in the best interest of all shareholders. We believe that shareholders should have an opportunity for fair discussion and to exchange views with the Board before shareholder action is taken.
Since shareholder action by written consent does not require advance notice or communication to all shareholders, it would deprive many shareholders of the opportunity to assess, discuss, deliberate and vote on pending shareholder actions. In addition, this approach may prevent shareholders from receiving accurate and complete information on important pending actions. It would also deny the Board the opportunity to consider the merits of the proposed action and to suggest alternatives for shareholder evaluation.
SUMMARY
We take pride in our responsiveness to shareholders and believe in maintaining policies and practices that serve the interests of all shareholders. Pfizer's existing corporate governance structure is highly supportive of shareholder rights and makes the adoption of written consent unnecessary.
108   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
The National Center for Public Policy Research, 20 F Street, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 2000, which represents that it owns no less than 80 shares of Pfizer common stock, has notified Pfizer that it will present the following proposal at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
The Shareholder's Resolution
Whereas,we believe in full disclosure of our Company's direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether Pfizer's lobbying is consistent with the Company's expressed goals and in the best interest of shareowners.
Resolved,the shareowners of Pfizer request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing:
For purposes of this proposal, a "grassroots lobbying communication" is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. "Indirect lobbying" is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Pfizer is a member.
Both "direct and indirect lobbying" and "grassroots lobbying communications" include efforts at the local, state and federal levels.
The report shall be presented to all relevant oversight committees and posted on Pfizer's website.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT
The Company lobbies on a broad array of issues and works with groups that do the same. That's a good thing as the Company is rightfully exercising free speech. As such, the Company has become a target for anti-free speech activists. These activists are working to defund pro-business organizations by attacking their corporate members.
The Company should take an active role in combating this narrative and attacks on its freedom of association rights.
The Company should be proud of its memberships in trade associations and non-profit groups that promote pro-business, pro-growth initiatives.
For example, the Company's relationships with groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, PhRMA, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce should be applauded and endorsed by shareholders. These groups advance initiatives that are designed to unburden corporations such as Pfizer, allowing them the freedom to create jobs and economic prosperity in the United States.
Rather than letting outside agitators set the message that these relationships are somehow nefarious, the Company should explain the benefits of its involvement with groups that advocate for smaller government, lower taxes, and free-market reforms. The Company should show how these relationships benefit shareholders, increase jobs and wages, help local communities, and generally advance the Company's interests.
The proponent supports the Company's free speech rights and freedom to associate with groups that advance economic liberty. The Company should stand up for those rights.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   109
Your Company's Response
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. The Board believes the actions requested by the proponent are unnecessary and not in the best interests of the company or our shareholders.
LOBBYING PRIORITIES AND DISCLOSURE
Our lobbying priorities consider the interests of our company, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. In 2018, Pfizer's federal lobbying priorities focused on trade, healthcare, access to prescription drugs and patent protection, all of which directly impact our business and shareholder value.
Pfizer's current disclosures, detailing our lobbying priorities, are fully compliant with the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act and filed quarterly with the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Included in the report is the total amount spent on federal lobbying activity for the quarter, which includes the percentage of our dues to trade associations spent on federal lobbying activity, payments to outside consultants, and the time spent by Pfizer colleagues on federal lobbying activity. Our disclosures on federal lobbying activities may be viewed at https://investors.pfizer.com/corporate-governance.
In all states where we are active, we are also fully compliant with state registration and reporting requirements.
We regularly evaluate our reporting practices and seek shareholder input to ensure our disclosures meet their needs and instill confidence in our policies and practices. A shareholder proposal requesting a detailed report on lobbying activities has been voted on by Pfizer's shareholders at previous Annual Meetings and, each time, the proposal has not received a majority of shareholder support.
OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH LAWMAKERS AND TRADE AND INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS
We operate in a highly regulated and competitive industry and continue to face significant legislative and regulatory challenges. It is essential that we actively engage with lawmakers and trade and industry organizations to help build constructive discourse in the political and regulatory environment in support of our business priorities. To enhance these efforts, we are members of several industry and trade groups.
In addition to their positions on healthcare policy issues, we realize these organizations may engage in activities that extend beyond the scope of Pfizer's priorities. Therefore, our participation as a member of various groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with the positions of the organization and/or its members on every issue. If concerns arise about a particular issue, we convey our views, as appropriate, through our colleagues who serve on the boards and committees of these groups. We believe there is value in making sure our position on issues important to Pfizer and our industry is communicated and understood within these organizations.
A listing of our current memberships with several industry and trade groups is available at https://www.pfizer.com/purpose/contributions-partnerships/political-partnerships.
ANNUAL EVALUATION OF OUR SUPPORT FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY GROUPS
We rely on Pfizer's U.S. Government Relations leaders, our experts in public policy and the political environment, to conduct an annual evaluation of our support of trade and industry groups in conjunction with members of the Executive Leadership Team, and our Chief Executive Officer, whenever necessary. These efforts are overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, as described below. Decisions to provide funding are based on an organization's support of issues that impact our industry, including advancing biomedical research, healthcare innovation, advocating for protecting intellectual property rights, and access to medicines. During their evaluation, our leaders will:

110   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
BOARD OVERSIGHT OF OUR LOBBYING ACTIVITIES
Pfizer's Board of Directors and its Committees also play an important role in our public policy engagement and have oversight responsibilities for these activities. The Corporate Governance Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, is responsible for reviewing the company's actions related to public policy, including its lobbying priorities and activities and associations with certain trade and/or legislative organizations through periodic reports from management.
SUMMARY
We believe our current disclosures already address the underlying concerns and satisfy the essential objectives of the proposal. Pfizer's federal and state lobbying disclosures are fully compliant with legal and regulatory requirements. We regularly evaluate our reporting practices and seek shareholder input to ensure our disclosures meet their needs and foster confidence in our policies and practices. We believe our current disclosures sufficiently meet the needs of our shareholders. Additional reporting as requested by the proponent will create an unnecessary expense and will not be of interest to the vast majority of our shareholders.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   111
The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, 609 South Convent Road, Aston, PA 19014-1207, which represents that it owns no less than 200 shares of Pfizer common stock, and co-filers have notified Pfizer that they will present the following proposal at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
The Shareholder's Resolution
Resolved:The shareholders request the Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. This policy would be phased in for the next CEO transition.
If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT:
We believe:
Pfizer's Ian Read has served both as CEO and Chair of the Company's Board of Directors and effective January 1 will step down as CEO and become Executive Chair of the Board. Dr. Bourla will become our new CEO. While this creates a separate Chair role, the position is not held by an independent Director. We believe Pfizer should create a stronger governance structure.
As Andrew Grove, Intel's former chair, stated, "The separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation. Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an employee? If he's an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the Board. The Chairman runs the Board. How can the CEO be his own boss?"
In our view, shareholders are best served by an independent Board Chair who can provide a balance of power between the CEO and the Board. The primary duty of a Board of Directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders. A former CEO serving as Chair can result in excessive management influence on the Board and weaker oversight of management. We urge Pfizer's Board to take the opportunity when Mr. Read leaves the Executive Chair position to appoint a new independent Chair.
Numerous institutional investors recommend independence for these two roles. For example, California's Retirement System CalPERS' Principles & Guidelines encourage separation, even with a lead director in place.
According to ISS "2017 Board Practices", (March 2017), 58% of S&P 1,500 firms separate these two positions and the number of companies separating these roles is growing.
A similar resolution to Pfizer last year received a 25.59% vote.
To simplify the transition, this policy would be phased in and implemented when the next CEO is chosen or when Mr. Read steps down as Executive Chair.
Your Company's Response
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. The Board believes that eliminating the flexibility to select a structure of Board leadership, based on the facts and circumstances presented at a particular point in time is unnecessarily rigid and not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders.
A FLEXIBLE LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR PFIZER AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS
The Board of Directors values having the flexibility of selecting the structure of leadership best suited to meet the needs of Pfizer and our shareholders. The Board which is composed of directors with diverse backgrounds, experience, perspectives and extensive knowledge about the company and our industry is best positioned to evaluate its optimal leadership structure. The Board believes the leadership structure best suited to meet the needs of Pfizer and our shareholders should be based on the
112   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
unique circumstances and challenges confronting the Board and company at any given time, as well as the individual skills and experiences that may be required in an effective Chairman. Given the dynamic and competitive environment in which we operate, the Board believes that the right leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant and does not view any particular Board leadership structure as preferred.
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Principles the independent Directors of the company annually elect a Chairman of the Board, who may or may not be the Chief Executive Officer of the company, based on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee as a result of its annual review of the Board's leadership structure. If the individual elected as Chairman is the Chief Executive Officer, the independent Directors also elect a Lead Independent Director.
In September 2018, following a thorough review by the Corporate Governance Committee and the independent Directors, the independent Directors reconsidered the Board's leadership structure and determined that the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer would not be combined. Following a vigorous multi-year management succession planning process by the Board, Dr. Albert Bourla was elected Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2019. Dr. Bourla succeeded Mr. Ian Read, who transitioned into the role of Executive Chairman on January 1, 2019. Mr. Shantanu Narayen, who has served as Lead Independent Director since April 2018, will continue as Lead Independent Director. We believe this Board leadership structure will help ensure continuity of strong and effective leadership.
OUR LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR PROVIDES STRONG, INDEPENDENT LEADERSHIP
The position of Lead Independent Director at Pfizer comes with a clear mandate, significant authority and well-defined responsibilities under a Board-approved charter. According to the charter, these responsibilities and authority include:
ANNUAL REVIEW OF BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
During the Board's annual review of its leadership structure, the independent Directors considered the pros and cons of alternative leadership structures taking into account the company's performance under the current operating and governance environment, executive leadership changes as well as investor feedback with the goal of achieving the optimal model for Board leadership and effective Board oversight of senior leaders. The Directors will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board's leadership structure on at least an annual basis and make any future decisions based upon the best interests of the company and our shareholders at that time.
The Board, which consists entirely of independent Directors other than Mr. Read and Dr. Bourla, exercises a strong, independent oversight function, which is further enhanced by the fact that our Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance, Regulatory and Compliance and Science and Technology Committees are composed entirely of independent Directors.
SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES SUPPORT INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT
The Board is confident that Pfizer's existing shareholder rights and strong corporate governance practices, including the annual election of directors, majority vote standard in uncontested Director elections, special meeting right and proxy access, provide a strong structure for ensuring independent oversight of the company and make a rigid policy on the selection of the Board's leadership structure unnecessary.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   113
These policies are bolstered by the Board's practices, which include frequent meetings in executive sessions, when our Executive Chairman and our CEO are not present, to discuss matters that fall under their purview as independent Directors. These topics include evaluation of the CEO, other senior leaders and succession planning. Independent Directors in executive session may also discuss the company's operating and financial performance, capital allocation priorities and other Board matters.
Furthermore, Pfizer's independent oversight as led by the Board is enhanced by the Board's ongoing refreshment, focus on diversity among Directors, regular rotation of committee Chairs and of the Lead Independent Director.
SUMMARY
We believe that the Board of Directors should maintain the flexibility to select the optimal structure of leadership best suited to meet the needs of Pfizer and its shareholders at any given time. In addition, given Pfizer's robust governance practices, including our strong Lead Independent Director, we believe that adoption of an independent chair policy is unnecessarily rigid and not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders.
114   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Trinity Health, 766 Brady Avenue, Apt. 635, Bronx, NY 10462 which represents that it owns over $2,000 worth of shares of Pfizer common stock, and other co-filers have notified Pfizer that the following proposal is to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
The Shareholder's Resolution
Resolved,that shareholders of Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") urge the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") to report annually to shareholders on the extent to which risks related to public concern over drug pricing strategies are integrated into Pfizer's incentive compensation policies, plans and programs ("arrangements") for senior executives. The report should include, but need not be limited to, discussion of whether (i) incentive compensation arrangements reward, or not penalize, senior executives for adopting pricing strategies, or making and honoring commitments about pricing, that incorporate public concern regarding prescription drug prices; and (ii) such concern is considered when setting financial targets for incentive compensation arrangements.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT
As long-term investors, we believe that senior executive incentive compensation arrangements should reward the creation of sustainable value. To that end, it is important that those arrangements align with company strategy and encourage responsible risk management.
A key risk facing pharmaceutical companies is potential backlash against high drug prices. Pfizer has been criticized for repeated price increases, and in July 2018 President Trump called out "Pfizer & others" in a tweet, saying they "should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason"; Pfizer then postponed planned increases.
We are concerned that the incentive compensation arrangements applicable to Pfizer's senior executives may discourage them from taking actions, like foregoing price increases, that result in lower short-term financial performance even when those actions may be in Pfizer's best long-term interests.
Pfizer uses revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as metrics for the annual bonus and operating income as a metric for performance share awards. (2018 Proxy Statement, at 66, 68) A 2017 Credit Suisse analyst report identified Pfizer as a company where U.S. net price increases accounted for at least 100% of 2016 net income growth. (Global Pharma and Biotech Sector Review: Exploring Future US Pricing Pressure, Apr. 18, 2017, at 22) In its 2018 report, Credit Suisse characterized Pfizer's 2017 10% net price increase as above-average for the industry and noted that its list price increases were the second highest. (Global Pharmaceuticals: Scoring Sensitivity to Trump's Reforms, May 25, 2018, at 15, 20)
In our view, excessive dependence on drug price increases is a risky and unsustainable strategy, especially when price hikes appear to drive large senior executive payouts. Highlighting this connection, a March 2018 article carried the headline, "Pfizer CEO Gets 61% Pay Raise-to $27.9 Million-As Drug Prices Continue to Climb." (https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/amid-drug-price-increases-pfizer-ceo-gets-61-pay-raise-to-27-9-million/; see also https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2017-08-30/bernie-sanders-take-on-big-pharma-and-lower-prescription-drug-prices) We are concerned that large payouts based on financial metrics that can be affected by pricing create risks for Pfizer.
The disclosure we request would allow shareholders to better assess the extent to which compensation arrangements encourage senior executives to responsibly manage risks relating to drug pricing and contribute to long-term value creation. For example, it would be useful for investors to know whether incentive compensation target amounts reflect consideration of pricing pressures. We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   115
Your Company's Response
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. The Board of Directors, and more specifically the Compensation Committee, believes that the actions requested by the proponents are unnecessary and not in the best interests of the company or our shareholders. Further, Pfizer has already addressed the underlying concerns and satisfied the essential objectives of the proposal through our varied and comprehensive risk management and oversight processes that assess and monitor risks, including risk related to drug pricing. Pfizer's executive compensation program is aligned with long-term performance and shareholder value measures that encourage thoughtful pricing actions. Additionally, our annual disclosure provides comprehensive information regarding our compensation philosophy and the factors integrated into the various components of our program that determine executive compensation each year.
PFIZER'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY IS ALIGNED WITH PERFORMANCE AND LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE
The goal of Pfizer's executive compensation philosophy is to incentivize actions and performance that drive shareholder value. Through the implementation of this philosophy we are working to align each executive's compensation with Pfizer's short- and long-term performance objectives and provide the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives crucial to Pfizer's long-term success. A significant portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of our executives is directly related to Pfizer's long-term total shareholder return and to other long-term performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic and operating plans. Over the past several years our long-term incentive compensation programs accounted for the largest portion of our named executive officers' compensation. For example, in 2017 long-term target incentive compensation, which is composed entirely of performance-based equity awards, comprised 73% of our CEO's annual target direct compensation and on average 60% of our other named executive officers' annual target direct compensation. Therefore, given the balance between our short-term and long-term incentives and our focus on alignment with shareholder value, our program already has imbedded controls to reduce the possibility that our executive officers will make decisions to maximize short-term results at the expense of long-term growth and value for our shareholders.
PFIZER PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURE REGARDING FACTORS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
We provide comprehensive disclosure regarding our compensation philosophy, components of our program and the performance of our executives each year in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) section of our Proxy Statement. Each year the CD&A provides shareholders with in-depth details regarding the Compensation Committee's process for setting executive compensation, the elements of our compensation plans, the factors the Committee considered when setting executive compensation, the various financial metrics and other important goals for the year and how the company's results and each executive's performance against those established metrics and goals impact incentive payouts and overall compensation. In addition, our shareholders have the opportunity to express their opinion of our executive compensation program through their annual say-on-pay vote. We believe that shareholders are given the disclosure necessary to assess our compensation arrangements, and an opportunity to express their opinion on our program, such that the additional report requested by the proponent is duplicative and unnecessary.
PFIZER IS COMMITTED TO PRICING THROUGH THE LENS OF LONG-TERM VALUE
The Board and our management believe that the most fundamental way the biopharmaceutical industry creates value is by discovering innovative medicines that help people live longer, healthier, more productive lives. Pfizer's approach to pricing medicines aims to reflect the value they deliver to patients, insurers, governments and society while allowing us to continue to achieve our mission. We may use flexible pricing approaches based on factors such as local needs, availability of treatment options, and a country's health systems' structure. The price of medicines over time may be impacted by ongoing research investment, patents, marketplace factors, including local laws and mandates among others. In many countries, we may use patient assistance programs to help support patient access when government or payer policies do not sufficiently cover critically needed medicines. Additionally, Pfizer supports healthcare system-wide price transparency that is thoughtful and purpose-driven that can result in improved patient care, a better understanding of the collective comparative value of all medical services, and a more patient-centered use of healthcare resources.
116   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
PFIZER'S COMPENSATION PROGRAM UNDERGOES A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL RISK ASSESSMENT
With the assistance of its independent compensation consultant FW Cook & Co., the Compensation Committee performs an annual comprehensive assessment of potential risks related to our compensation program, policies and practices. Additionally, and as discussed earlier in this Proxy Statement, our Board has oversight responsibility for risk assessment and risk management directly and through its Committees, including through the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. The Board receives regular reports from members of our executive leadership team that include a discussion of risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility and is routinely informed of developments that could affect our risk profile and other aspects of our business. In addition to the Compensation Committee's role in oversight of risk related to our compensation programs, the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing Pfizer's ERM program, which includes reviewing risks associated with drug pricing and other significant risk factors posing potential reputational risk to Pfizer. The Regulatory and Compliance Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing and reviewing significant risks associated with Pfizer's healthcare law compliance programs and applicable laws. Each Committee reports to the Board during every regular meeting which includes discussions on risk oversight. Given the various Board and Committee processes for assessing and reviewing potential risks, any potential risks related to drug pricing and its impact on our executive compensation would be reviewed and addressed by our Board and its Committees.
SUMMARY
The Board believes that the annual report requested by the proponent is duplicative and unnecessary. Our executive compensation program is appropriately balanced and aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Our program does not encourage decisions that would create short-term financial gains at the expense of long-term value. Additionally, our CD&A provides comprehensive information regarding our compensation program and Compensation Committee determinations such that shareholders can assess our executive compensation each year, and provide a fully-informed annual say-on-pay advisory vote. Moreover, our internal processes ensure that we take a thoughtful approach to drug pricing and monitor risks associated with our compensation program and other enterprise risks, including those risks associated with drug pricing.

For all proposals, except approval of the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan, if you abstain from voting or there is a broker non-vote on any matter, your abstention or broker non-vote will not affect the outcome of such vote, because abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast under our By-laws.
*This proposal is also subject to NYSE shareholder approval rules. Broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan; however, abstentions are counted as votes cast and therefore will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal.
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; MAJORITY VOTE POLICY
Under our By-laws and our Corporate Governance Principles, Directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections, such as the election of Directors at the Annual Meeting. This means that the number of votes cast "for" a Director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" a Director nominee. Any nominee who does not receive a majority of votes cast "for" his or her election would be required to tender his or her resignation promptly following the failure to receive the required vote. Within 90 days of the certification of the shareholder vote, the Corporate Governance Committee would then be required to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the Board should accept the resignation, and the Board would be required to decide whether to accept the resignation and disclose its decision-making process. In a contested election, the required vote would be a plurality of votes cast. Full details of this policy are set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles (see "Annex 1" to this Proxy Statement).
RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF KPMG LLP
Under our By-laws, the votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions are not counted as votes "for" or "against" this proposal.
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Under our By-laws, the votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" this proposal.
APPROVAL OF PFIZER INC. 2019 STOCK PLAN
Under our By-laws, the votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan. This proposal is also subject to NYSE shareholder approval rules. Broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan; however, abstentions are counted as votes cast and therefore will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Under our By-laws, the votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve a shareholder proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" the shareholder proposals.

Proxy Materials
Why did I receive these proxy materials?
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation, of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and at any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.
The Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and a proxy or voting instruction card are being mailed or made available to shareholders starting on or about March 14, 2019.
Why did I receive a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" but no proxy materials?
We distribute our proxy materials to certain shareholders via the Internet under the "Notice and Access" approach permitted by rules of the SEC. This approach conserves natural resources and reduces our distribution costs, while providing a timely and convenient method of accessing the materials and voting. On March 14, 2019, we mailed a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" to participating shareholders, containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet. To request a free set of printed materials for this meeting or for future mailings, refer to the Notice for detailed instructions on how to request a copy via Internet, telephone or e-mail.
Can I access the proxy materials and the 2018 Financial Report on the Internet?
This Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and the 2018 Financial Report are available on our website at https://investors.pfizer.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx. Instead of receiving future proxy statements and accompanying materials by mail, most shareholders can elect to receive an e-mail that will provide electronic links to them. Opting to receive your proxy materials online will conserve natural resources and will save us the cost of producing documents and mailing them to you, and will also give you an electronic link to the proxy voting site.
Shareholders of Record: If you vote on the Internet at www.investorvote.com/PFE, simply follow the prompts to enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service. You also may enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service at any time in the future by going directly to http://www.computershare-na.com/green/ and following the enrollment instructions.
Beneficial Owners: You also may be able to receive copies of these documents electronically. Please check the information provided in the proxy materials sent to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record regarding the availability of this service.
What is "householding" and how does it affect me?
We have adopted a procedure, approved by the SEC, called "householding." Under this procedure, shareholders of record who have the same address and last name and receive hard copies of the Annual Meeting materials will receive only one copy of this Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and the 2018 Financial Report, unless we are notified that one or more of these shareholders wishes to continue receiving individual copies. If you and other Pfizer shareholders living in your household do not have the same last name, you may also request to receive only one copy of future proxy statements and financial reports.
Householding conserves natural resources and reduces our printing and mailing costs. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Also, householding will not in any way affect dividend check mailings.
If you are eligible for householding, but you and other shareholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of this Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents, or if you hold Pfizer stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy of each document for your household, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, in writing at P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000; or by telephone, in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, 1-800-733-9393, and outside the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, 1-781-575-4591.
Alternatively, if you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of this Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents or prefer to discontinue your participation in householding, please contact Computershare as indicated above, and a separate copy will be sent to you promptly.
If you are a beneficial owner, you can request information about householding from your broker, bank or other holder of record.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   121
How can I obtain a copy of Pfizer's 2018 Annual Review?
The company's Annual Review is available on our website at www.pfizer.com/annual. Pfizer is working hard to be a green company; therefore, hard copies of the report are no longer produced.
Other Questions
What is a broker non-vote?
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, you must instruct the broker how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the broker can register your shares as being present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under NYSE rules.
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, your broker has discretionary voting authority under NYSE rules to vote your shares on the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. However, your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of Directors, the advisory approval of executive compensation, the approval of the Pfizer Inc. 2019 Stock Plan or the shareholder proposals without instructions from you, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and holding shares as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered in your name with Pfizer's transfer agent, Computershare, you are the "shareholder of record" of those shares. This Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying materials have been provided directly to you by Pfizer.
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares, and this Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents have been provided to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet.
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?
The Board is not aware of any matters that are expected to come before the 2019 Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this Proxy Statement (see "Other Business" below).
If you return your signed and completed proxy card or vote by telephone or on the Internet and other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration, the Proxy Committee appointed by the Board of Directors will have the discretion to vote for you on such matters and intends to vote the proxies in accordance with its best judgment.
Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?
Pfizer will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by our Directors, officers or employees in person or by telephone, mail, electronic transmission and/or facsimile transmission. We have hired Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, to distribute and solicit proxies. We will pay Morrow Sodali LLC a fee of $35,000, plus reasonable expenses, for these services.

Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   123
Annex 1
Pfizer Inc. Corporate Governance Principles
Role and Composition of the Board of Directors
1. General.The Board of Directors (the Board), which is elected by the shareholders, is the ultimate decision-making body of Pfizer Inc. (the Company), except with respect to those matters reserved to the shareholders. It selects the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the senior management team, which is charged with the conduct of the Company's business. Having selected the senior management team, the Board acts as an advisor and counselor to senior management and ultimately monitors its performance. The function of the Board to monitor the performance of senior management is facilitated by the presence of non-employee Directors of stature who have substantive knowledge of the Company's business.
2. Succession Planning.The Board is responsible for planning for succession to the position of Chief Executive Officer as well as certain other senior management positions. To assist the Board, the Chief Executive Officer shall annually provide the Board with an assessment of other senior managers and their potential to succeed him or her. He or she shall also provide the Board with an assessment of persons considered potential successors to certain senior management positions.
3. Board Leadership.The independent Directors will annually elect a Chairman of the Board, who may or may not be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, based on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee as a result of its annual review of the Company's Board leadership structure. If the individual elected as Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer, the independent Directors shall also elect a Lead Independent Director. The Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the shareholders and of the Board as a whole, as well as over executive sessions of the independent Directors, and shall perform such other duties, and exercise such powers, as from time to time shall be prescribed in the Company's By-laws or by the Board; provided that the Lead Independent Director, if any, shall preside over executive sessions of the Company's independent Directors. In addition, the Lead Independent Director, if any, shall facilitate information flow and communication among the Directors and perform such other duties as may be specified by the Board and outlined in the Charter of the Lead Independent Director. The Board shall consider the rotation of the Lead Independent Director, if any, at such intervals as the Board determines on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee.
4. Director Independence. It is the policy of the Company that the Board consist of a majority of independent Directors. The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board has established Director Qualification Standards to assist it in determining Director independence, which either meet or exceed the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) corporate governance listing standards. The Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances in making an independence determination, and not merely from the standpoint of the Director, but also from that of persons or organizations with which the Director has an affiliation.
5. Board Size.It is the policy of the Company that the number of Directors not exceed a number that can function efficiently as a body. The Corporate Governance Committee shall periodically consider and make recommendations to the Board concerning the appropriate size and needs of the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates to fill new positions created by increases in the size of the Board and vacancies that occur by resignation, by retirement or for any other reason.
6. Selection Criteria.To be considered for membership on the Board, candidates should be individuals of proven integrity who have demonstrated, by having a record of substantial achievement in an area of relevance to the Company, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to the Board's advising, counseling and monitoring roles. In selecting Directors, the Board will generally seek leaders of major complex organizations, including within the scientific, government service, educational, finance, marketing, technology and the not-for-profit sectors. In addition, the Board also will seek some Directors who are widely recognized as leaders in the fields of medicine or the biological sciences. A candidate must also possess a judicious and critical temperament that will enable objective appraisal of management's plans and programs. Each Director is expected to serve the best interests of all shareholders and must be committed to enhancing long-term Company growth. Directors should be selected so that the Board of Directors is a diverse body, with diversity reflecting gender, ethnic background and professional experience. Candidates considered by the Corporate Governance Committee shall also be considered by other Directors, based on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, and final approval of a candidate shall be determined by the full Board. Recommendations for Directors received from shareholders will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth above.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   i
7. Voting for Directors.In accordance with the Company's By-laws, unless the Secretary of the Company determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected as of the record date for any meeting of the shareholders, a nominee must receive more votes cast for than against his or her election or re-election in order to be elected or re-elected to the Board. The Board expects a Director to tender his or her resignation if he or she fails to receive the required number of votes for re-election. The Board shall nominate for election or re-election as Director only candidates who agree to tender, promptly following such person's failure to receive the required vote for election or re-election at the next shareholder meeting at which such person would face election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation that will be effective upon Board acceptance of such resignation. In addition, the Board shall fill Director vacancies and new directorships only with candidates who agree to tender, promptly following their appointment to the Board, the same form of resignation tendered by other Directors in accordance with this Corporate Governance Principle.
If an incumbent Director fails to receive the required vote for re-election, then, within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote, the Corporate Governance Committee will act to determine whether to accept the Director's resignation and will submit such recommendation for prompt consideration by the Board, and the Board will act on the Committee's recommendation. The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a Director's resignation.
Any Director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer.
Thereafter, the Board will promptly disclose its decision-making process and decision regarding whether to accept the Director's resignation offer (or the reason(s) for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable) in a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor report) furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If each member of the Corporate Governance Committee fails to receive the required vote in favor of his or her election in the same election, then those independent Directors who did receive the required vote shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them.
However, if the only Directors who receive the required vote in the same election constitute three or fewer Directors, all Directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers.
8. Director Service on Other Public Boards. Ordinarily, Directors should not serve on more than four other boards of public companies in addition to the Company's Board.
9. Former Chief Executive Officer as Director. Upon retirement from the Company, the former Chief Executive Officer will not retain Board membership.
10. Change in Director Occupation. When a Director's principal occupation or business association changes substantially during his or her tenure as a Director, that Director shall tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board the action, if any, to be taken with respect to the resignation.
11. Director Compensation. The Corporate Governance Committee shall periodically review the compensation of non-employee Directors.
12. Ownership Requirement. Each non-employee Director is required to hold shares of the Company's common stock having a value of at least five (5) times the Director's annual base cash compensation while serving as a Director of the Company. For purposes of satisfying these requirements, (a) a Director's holdings of the Company's common stock shall include, in addition to shares held outright, units granted to the Director as compensation for Board service and shares or units held under a deferral or similar plan and (b) each such unit shall have the same value as a share of the Company's common stock. A Director will have five years from the date of (a) his or her first election as a Director or (b) if later, an increase in the amount of the Company's common stock required to be held, to satisfy this ownership requirement.
13. Director Retirement.Directors are required to retire from the Board when they reach the age of 73; a Director elected to the Board prior to his or her 73rd birthday may continue to serve until the annual shareholders meeting following his or her 73rd birthday. On the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board may waive this requirement as to any Director if it deems such waiver to be in the best interests of the Company.
14. Annual Board and Committee Self-Evaluation. The Board (under the supervision of the Corporate Governance Committee) and each Committee will conduct a self-evaluation of their performance at least annually.
ii   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
15. Term Limits.The Board does not endorse arbitrary term limits on Directors' service, nor does it believe in automatic annual re-nomination until Directors reach the mandatory retirement age. The Board self-evaluation process is an important determinant for continuing service.
16. Committees.It is the general policy of the Company that all major decisions be considered by the Board as a whole. As a consequence, the Committee structure of the Board is limited to those Committees considered to be basic to, or required or appropriate for, the operation of the Company. Currently these Committees are the Executive Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Corporate Governance Committee, Regulatory and Compliance Committee and Science and Technology Committee.
The members and chairs of these Committees are recommended to the Board by the Corporate Governance Committee. The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance Committee are made up of only independent Directors, as defined under the NYSE listing standards and all applicable laws and regulations. In addition to the requirement that a majority of the Board satisfy the independence standards noted above in Paragraph 4, Director Independence, members of the Audit Committee also must satisfy an additional NYSE independence standard. Specifically, they may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than their Director compensation. As a matter of policy, the Board also will apply a separate and heightened independence standard to members of both the Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees. No member of either Committee may be a partner, member or principal of a law firm, accounting firm or investment banking firm that accepts consulting or advisory fees from the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Board also will apply any heightened independence standards applicable to members of those Committees pursuant to NYSE requirements.
The Board shall consider the rotation of committee assignments and of committee Chairs at such intervals as the Board determines on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee. Consideration of rotation shall seek to balance the benefits derived from continuity and experience, on the one hand, and the benefits derived from gaining fresh perspectives and enhancing Directors' understanding of different aspects of the Company's business and enabling functions.
17. Director Orientation and Continuing Education. In furtherance of its policy of having major decisions made by the Board as a whole, the Company has a full orientation and continuing education process for Board members that includes extensive materials, meetings with key management and visits to Company facilities.
18. Chief Executive Officer Performance Goals and Annual Evaluation. The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting annual and long-term performance goals for the Chief Executive Officer and for evaluating his or her performance against such goals. The Committee meets annually with the Chief Executive Officer to receive his or her recommendations concerning such goals. Both the goals and the evaluation are then submitted for consideration by the independent Directors at a meeting or executive session of that group. The Committee then meets with the Chief Executive Officer to evaluate his or her performance against such goals.
19. Senior Management Performance Goals. The Compensation Committee also is responsible for setting annual and long-term performance goals and compensation for the direct reports to the Chief Executive Officer. These decisions are approved or ratified by action of the independent Directors at a meeting or executive session of that group.
20. Communication with Stakeholders. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for establishing effective communications with the Company's stakeholder groups, i.e., shareholders, customers, Company associates, communities, suppliers, creditors, governments and corporate partners.
It is the policy of the Company that management speaks for the Company. This policy does not preclude non-employee Directors, including the Chairman of the Board (if the Chairman is a non-employee Director) or the Lead Independent Director, from meeting with shareholders, but it is suggested that in most circumstances any such meetings be held with management present.
21. Annual Meeting Attendance. All Board members are expected to attend our Annual Meeting of Shareholders unless an emergency prevents them from doing so.
Board Functions
22. Agenda.The Chief Executive Officer, with approval from the Chairman of the Board (if the Chairman is a non-employee Director) or the Lead Independent Director, shall set the agenda for Board meetings with the understanding that the Board is
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   iii responsible for providing suggestions for agenda items that are aligned with the advisory and monitoring functions of the Board. Agenda items that fall within the scope of responsibilities of a Board Committee are reviewed with the chair of that Committee. Any member of the Board may request that an item be included on the agenda.
23. Board Materials.Board materials related to agenda items are provided to Board members sufficiently in advance of Board meetings to allow the Directors to prepare for discussion of the items at the meeting.
24. Board Meetings.At the invitation of the Board, members of senior management and other employees recommended by the Chief Executive Officer shall attend Board meetings or portions thereof for the purpose of participating in discussions. Generally, presentations of matters to be considered by the Board are made by the manager responsible for that area of the Company's operations.
25. Director Access to Corporate and Independent Advisors. In addition, Board members have free access to all other members of management and employees of the Company and, as necessary and appropriate, Board members may consult with independent legal, financial, accounting and other advisors to assist in their duties to the Company and its shareholders.
26. Executive Sessions.Executive sessions or meetings of non-employee Directors without management present are held regularly (at least four times a year) to review the report of the independent registered public accounting firm, the criteria upon which the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior managers is based, the performance of the Chief Executive Officer against such criteria, the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior managers, and any other relevant matters. Meetings are held from time to time with the Chief Executive Officer for a general discussion of relevant subjects.
Committee Functions
27. Independence.The Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees consist only of independent Directors. A majority of the members of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee must be independent Directors.
28. Meeting Conduct.The frequency, length and agenda of meetings of each of the Committees are determined by the chair of the Committee. Sufficient time to consider the agenda items is provided. Materials related to agenda items are provided to the Committee members sufficiently in advance of the meeting where necessary to allow the members to prepare for discussion of the items at the meeting.
29. Committee Meetings.At the invitation of any of the Committees, members of senior management and other employees recommended by the Chief Executive Officer shall attend Committee meetings or portions thereof for the purpose of participating in discussions. Generally, presentations of matters to be considered by the Committee are made by the manager responsible for that area of the Company's operations.
30. Scope of Responsibilities. The responsibilities of each of the Committees are determined by the Board from time to time.
Policy on Poison Pills
31. Expiration of Rights Agreement. The Board amended Pfizer's Rights Agreement, or "Poison Pill," to cause the Agreement to expire on December 31, 2003. The term Poison Pill refers to a type of shareholder rights plan that some companies adopt to provide an opportunity for negotiation during a hostile takeover attempt.
The Board has adopted a statement of policy that it shall seek and obtain shareholder approval before adopting a Poison Pill; provided, however, that the Board may determine to act on its own to adopt a Poison Pill, if, under the circumstances, the Board, including the majority of the independent members of the Board, in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, deems it to be in the best interest of Pfizer's shareholders to adopt a Poison Pill without the delay in adoption that would come from the time reasonably anticipated to seek shareholder approval.
If the Board were ever to adopt a Poison Pill without prior shareholder approval, the Board would either submit the Poison Pill to shareholders for ratification, or would cause the Poison Pill to expire within one year.
The Corporate Governance Committee will review this Poison Pill policy statement on an annual basis, including the stipulation which addresses the Board's fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of the shareholders without prior shareholder approval, and report to the Board any recommendations it may have concerning the policy.
Periodic Review of Corporate Governance Principles
32. These principles are reviewed by the Board at least annually.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the Non-Employee Directors, including a designated committee of the Board composed solely of Non-Employee Directors, shall have the authority, in their sole and absolute discretion, to select Non-Employee Directors as Participants who are eligible to receive Awards other than Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. The Non-Employee Directors shall set the terms of any such Awards in their sole and absolute discretion, and the Non-Employee Directors shall be responsible for administering and construing such Awards in substantially the same manner that the Committee administers and construes Awards to Employees; provided, however, that no Non-Employee Directors shall be granted Awards and / or paid a cash retainer in any calendar year under this Plan or any other arrangement with the Company having an aggregate value of more than eight hundred thousand dollars ($800,000). Any compensation that is deferred shall be counted toward this limit for the year in which it was first earned, and not when paid or settled if later.
Section 6. Stock Options.
Options may be granted hereunder to any Participant; either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan and shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

Section 14. Dividends.
Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award (including, without limitation, any deferred Award) may, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, cash or stock dividends, or Dividend xvi   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Equivalents with respect to the number of Shares covered by the Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested; provided, however, that dividends and or Dividend Equivalents that can be earned with respect to an Award, shall only become payable if and to the extent the underlying Award vests, regardless of whether or not vesting is contingent upon the achievement of performance goals or time and provided further, however, that if the receipt of any such Dividend Equivalents granted with respect to Options, TSRUs, Restricted Stock, Other Stock Unit Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights is contingent upon the exercise of the Options or TSRUs or Stock Appreciation Right, or the vesting of the Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, or Other Stock Unit Awards, then the Options, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Other Stock Unit Awards, or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be granted and administered in accordance with all applicable provisions of Section 409A.
Section 15. Deferral of Awards Under The Company's Deferred Compensation Plan.
Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, the Committee may provide upon the granting of an Award hereunder, other than an Award that is intended to be a stock right which does not constitute a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(a)(5) so that it is subject to the requirement that it not include any feature for the deferral of compensation until an event enumerated in such provision, that it is eligible to be deferred under, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the Pfizer Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, as may be amended or restated from time to time (or under any other Company deferred compensation plan or deferral election form). Any such deferral shall be in accordance with the terms of such plan and in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A.
Section 16. General Provisions.
Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT   /   xvii xviii   /   Pfizer  2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Section 17. Term of Plan.
The Plan shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, unless sooner terminated by the Board pursuant to Section 13; provided, however, in no event may an Incentive Stock Option be granted more than ten (10) years after the earlier of (i) the date of the adoption of the Plan by the Board or (ii) the Effective Date.
Section 18. Compliance with Section 16.
With respect to Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Members"), transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. To the extent that compliance with any Plan provision applicable solely to such Members that is included solely for purposes of complying with Rule 16b-3 is not required in order to bring a transaction by such Member in compliance with Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed null and void as to such transaction, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee. To the extent any provision in the Plan or action by the Committee involving such Members is deemed not to comply with an applicable condition of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed null and void as to such Members, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.
Section 19. Compliance with Section 409A.
The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under the Plan comply with Section 409A to the extent subject thereto or an exemption therefrom, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and be administered to be in compliance therewith. Any payments described in the Plan that are due within the "short-term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, no payment or distribution under this Plan that constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Section 409A and becomes payable by reason of a Participant's termination of employment or service with the Company will be made to such Participant until such Participant's termination of employment or service constitutes a Separation from Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided during the six (6) month period immediately following the Participant's termination of employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following the Participant's separation from service (or upon the Participant's death, if earlier). In addition, for purposes of the Plan, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided to the Participant pursuant to the Plan, which constitutes deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A. For any payment under the Plan that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred under the Plan with respect to such payment only if a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company shall also be deemed to have occurred under Section 409A. The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments or benefits described in this Plan will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to any such payment. The Participant shall be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A.
