PROPOSAL I: TO ELECT THE CHAIR
PROPOSAL II: TO ELECT TWO (2) CLASS II UNION TRUSTEES 
Under the Trust's Declaration of Trust, the Board of Trustees may have up to 25 Trustees. Up to 12 Trustees may be Union Trustees, up to 12 Trustees may be Management Trustees, and one additional Trustee is to be the Chair. The Board of Trustees currently consists of 16 Trustees, eight (8) of whom are Union Trustees (Alvarez, Boland, Cooper, Durkee, McGarvey, Rigmaiden, Shuler, and Trumka), seven (7) of whom are Management Trustees (Gainer, Quinn, Rubin, Schmidt, Spear, Stanley, and Thompson), and one (1) of whom is the Chair (Kanovsky).
The Declaration of Trust divides the Union and Management Trustees into three classes (each, a "Class"). Each Class is required to have, insofar as the pool of Trustees permits, an equal number of Union and Management Trustees. The term of each Class expires at the third Annual Meeting following its election; the term of one Class expires each year. At each Annual Meeting, the Participants elect a Chair to serve until the next Annual Meeting and such number of Trustees as is necessary to fill vacancies in (i) the Class whose terms expire as of that meeting, and (ii) any other Class. The terms of office of Trustees McGarvey, Shuler and Spear will expire on the day of the Meeting. Trustees McGarvey and Shuler are standing for re-election as Class II Union Trustees. Trustee Spear has chosen to retire from the Board of Trustees so she is not standing for re-election and her term will expire on the day of the meeting.
The principal occupations and business experience for at least the past five years of Chair Kanovsky and Trustees McGarvey and Shuler are described below under "Nominees for Election."
If the enclosed Proxy is received from a Participant, the Units of Participation represented by such Proxy will be voted for the nominees listed below (unless otherwise indicated on the Proxy). Each Class II Trustee will serve a three-year term ending in 2021, or until the successor of each is elected and qualifies. If elected, Ms. Kanovsky will serve as Chair for a one-year term ending in 2019, or until her successor is elected and qualifies.
Although the Trust does not contemplate that any of the nominees will be unavailable for election, if a vacancy in the slate of nominees should be occasioned by death or other unexpected occurrence, it is currently intended that the Proxies will be voted for such other persons, if any, as the Nominating Committee may recommend. Proxies will not be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.
Nominees for Election 
The following information was furnished to the Trust by each nominee and sets forth the name, age, principal occupation or employment of each nominee and the period during which he or she has served as a Trustee of the Trust, if any. Each nominee has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve on the Board of Trustees if elected.

Organization of Board of Trustees 
Under the terms of the Declaration of Trust, the Board of Trustees of the Trust has overall responsibility for the management and policies of the Trust. The Board of Trustees maintains four committees: the Executive Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Committee of the Whole.
The current members of the Executive Committee are Chair Kanovsky and Trustees Quinn, Rigmaiden, Shuler, Stanley and Trumka. None of these persons is an interested person, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Committee chooses one of its members to serve as Chair of the Committee. The Executive Committee has all the authority of the Board of Trustees when the Board is not in session. It met once during 2017 and has met once year-to-date 2018. No committee functions as a compensation committee as such. The Executive Committee, however, may make recommendations to the Board of Trustees concerning compensation payable to Trustees acting in their capacities as trustees and compensation payable to some executive officers. See "COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS."
Individuals are not eligible to invest in the HIT and none of the Trustees or officers owns any Units of the HIT.
Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee is a separately chartered committee which was formally constituted by the Board of Trustees on April 7, 2004. The current members of the Nominating Committee are Trustees Shuler (Chair), McGarvey and Gainer. None of these persons is an interested person, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Nominating Committee is responsible for the nomination of persons to serve as members of the Board of Trustees. The Nominating Committee met once in 2017, when the Nominating Committee was convened during a meeting of the Committee of the Whole of the Board of Trustees, and has met twice year-to-date in 2018.
The Nominating Committee has a charter, a copy of which was filed as an appendix to the May 18, 2005 Proxy Statement. Pursuant to Section (4) of its charter, the Nominating Committee will consider Trustee candidates recommended by Participants. The Nominating Committee has not adopted formal procedures to be followed by Participants in submitting such recommendations. However, it is the practice of the Board of Trustees, the members of which are disinterested, to set a record date by which Participants in the Trust may submit matters for consideration by the Participants at the Annual Meeting, including recommendations for Trustee candidates. Once received, the Nominating Committee reviews the eligibility of each candidate in accordance with the criteria set forth in the charter.
All candidates are evaluated in the same manner, regardless of the process by which they were recommended. Pursuant to the Nominating Committee charter, candidates are evaluated by the Committee in terms of relevant experience that would enable the candidate to serve effectively as a Trustee, as well as compatibility with respect to the Trust's mission. In addition, candidates are evaluated based on their eligibility to serve under the Trust's Declaration of Trust. When a viable candidate has been identified, the members of the Committee may conduct in-person interviews of such candidate. When all of the candidates recommended to the Committee have been evaluated and, if applicable, interviewed, the Committee will determine which of the viable candidates should be presented to the Board of Trustees of the Trust for nomination to Participants to become a member of the Board of Trustees of the Trust. The Trustees' policy is to nominate Trustees in a manner that seeks to produce the best candidates with a diversity of qualities, experience, backgrounds and complementary skills.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a separately constituted committee within the meaning of Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It monitors the accounting practices and performance of Trust management and the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm. The Board of Trustees previously selected Trustee Spear (designated Audit Committee Financial Expert) to be Chairperson of the Committee and Trustees Boland, Quinn, Shuler and Stanley to serve as the current members of the Committee. None of these persons would be interested persons, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Trustees, a copy of which was filed as an appendix to the Trust's registration statement. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee must meet annually with the independent registered public accounting firm to review the audit outside the presence of Trust management. The Audit Committee met three times in 2017 and has met two times year-to-date 2018.
Committee of the Whole
The Committee of the Whole monitors the Trust's investment practices and policies, reviews proposed changes thereto, considers new investment practices and policies and oversees the marketing policies and strategies of the Trust. This Committee is currently composed of all Trustees. It met once in 2017 and it has not met year-to- date 2018.
Board of Trustees
The Board of Trustees met three times during the Trust's fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and has met six times year-to-date in 2018. Trustees McGarvey and Trumka each attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (1) the total number of meetings of the Board of Trustees (held during the period for which they were Trustees) and (2) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Trustees on which they served (during the periods that they served) during the 2017 fiscal year. Board members who have been unable to attend meetings due to scheduling conflicts receive all materials and are regularly briefed on matters before the Board.
As the Trust's investors are made up primarily of eligible pension plans, Participants have ready access to the Board of Trustees, both collectively and individually. This may be accomplished by contacting, in the first instance, the Trust's Chief Operating Officer. Participants may also contact Trustees directly (several of whom sit on the Boards of Participants). In addition, since historically the Trust's Board of Trustees has been comprised solely of independent trustees and an independent Chair, the Trust has no policy with respect to Trustee attendance at the Annual Meeting. No Trustee and no Participant attended the Annual Meeting in 2017.
Consistent with its overall responsibility for the management and policies of the HIT, the Board of Trustees oversees the risk management of the HIT directly and, through its committee structure and delegations to HIT management, indirectly. The Board of Trustees has adopted and periodically reviews and approves policies and procedures which are designed to address areas of potential concern, such as valuation, internal controls, and portfolio management and which regulate the daily business conduct of the HIT. The Board of Trustees requires regular reports from Trust management on matters related to risk both at its regular meetings and periodically throughout the year. The Chief Financial Officer reports regularly to the Board of Trustees and the Audit Committee on matters related to internal controls, audits and accounting. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Board of Trustees in person and in writing regarding the effectiveness of the HIT's compliance program and other compliance related matters at least annually. In addition, the Board of Trustees and the Audit Committee requires regular reports from independent valuation validation consultants and the HIT's independent auditor and periodic reports from outside counsel and fund compliance service providers to assist its risk management efforts.
Compensation of Trustees and Executive Officers 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Chairman Ravitch received $10,000 in compensation. The Trust paid each Management Trustee who did not waive such fee $500 per day for attendance at Board of Trustees and committee meetings. The Trust paid no fee to any Union Trustee. The aggregate compensation paid to Trustees in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $18,500. The Trust reimbursed all Trustees for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board of Trustees and committee meetings.
2017 Compensation Table
The following table sets forth the aggregate compensation from the HIT to each of the three highest paid officers of the HIT and to all Trustees of the HIT in 2017. Mr. Coyle, listed below, retired from his position of Chief Executive Officer, in September 2018, at which time Mr. Suh was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Portfolio Manager. The HIT is a single, self-managed fund, and its staff as of December 31, 2017 included 53 employees. Therefore, in addition to those individuals identified in the table below, the HIT had 49 other employees who earned aggregate compensation exceeding $60,000 during the 2017 fiscal year.

The HIT adopted the Retirement Plan described below for all of its employees except for its Chief Executive Officer (who by the terms of the Retirement Plan is ineligible), effective as of October 1, 1990. Mr. Coyle has participated in a separate non-qualified retirement plan since the start of his employment in 1992. Effective October 1, 1996, the HIT adopted the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust 401(k) Plan described below for all of its employees, including its Chief Executive Officer.
THE RETIREMENT PLAN
Under the Staff Retirement Plan, contributions are based on an eligible employee's base salary. The Internal Revenue Service imposes an annual maximum on the amount that can be included in determining base salary during 2017, which amount was $270,000. In general, employer contribution rates are determined actuarially every year. The Staff Retirement Plan was funded by employer contributions at rates of approximately 24.00% of eligible employees' base salaries during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, the annual base salary for pension purposes of Mr. Chandler and Mr. Suh was $250,000 each consistent with the terms of the current salary freeze in Final Average Salary explained below.
The Staff Retirement Plan is open to employees of the AFL-CIO and other participating employers that are approved by the Staff Retirement Plan's board of trustees and that make contributions to the Staff Retirement Plan on their behalf. Such employees become members of the Staff Retirement Plan on their first day of employment that they are scheduled to work at least 1,000 hours during the next 12 consecutive months.
The Staff Retirement Plan provides a retirement pension to eligible employees for life, beginning at age 65 if the employee has at least three years of credited service, beginning at age 60 if the employee has at least 10 years of credited service, or beginning at age 50 if the employee's age plus years of credited service equals 80 or more. The amount of this pension depends on average base salary and years of credited service at retirement. Eligible employees will receive 3.00% of an average of their highest three years' base earnings ("Final Average Salary") for each year of credited service up to 25 years, and 0.5% of their Final Average Salary of each year of credited service over 25 years. This calculated amount is subject to (1) Internal Revenue Service limits, (2) the Staff Retirement Plan modification noted below and (3) certain elections related to survivor benefits made by the employee at the time of retirement. The Staff Retirement Plan modified the calculation of the Final Average Salary effective June 30, 2014 such that, the Final Average Salary would be frozen for vested employees and would be capped as the average of the first three years of service for unvested employees.
Set forth below is a table showing estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement in specified compensation and years of service classifications. As of the date hereof, Mr. Chandler has approximately nine and Mr. Suh has approximately 20 credited years of service under the Staff Retirement Plan.
5 Ms. Spear, whose term expires at the Meeting, is not standing for re-election to the Board. Mr. Coyle separately participates in a non-qualified retirement plan, commonly referred to as a "top hat plan", maintained by HIT.  Under this plan, Mr. Coyle receives a company credit under the plan equal to one-third of his salary with an option to defer additional amounts consistent with tax laws.  Vesting under the plan is immediate.  Amounts deferred under the plan prior to 2005 and in 2014 are currently being distributed in accordance with Mr. Coyle's elections.  The HIT carries the accrued liability for the benefit under the plan in its financial statements and pays benefits as prescribed by the plan. 
The 401(k) Plan
Under the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust 401(k) Plan, an eligible employee may designate to set aside up to 100% of his or her total compensation, up to the IRS maximum. The HIT is matching dollar-for-dollar the first $6,000 contributed in 2018. The amount deferred by an eligible employee and the amount of the HIT's matching contribution, if any, will be deposited in a trust account in the employee's name and vests immediately. Every employee of the HIT is eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan provided such employee has reached the age of 21 and is not a nonresident alien. An eligible employee may enroll in the 401(k) Plan at any time during the year.
When a participating employee terminates his or her employment, retires or becomes disabled, the employee will be able to receive as a lump sum payment the salary reduction amounts that were contributed to the trust account on the employee's behalf, the additional amounts that the HIT contributed to the trust account on the employee's behalf, plus income earned (or less losses incurred) as a result of investment of these contributions (less the employee's allocated share of expenses).
Except as noted below, an actively working employee under age 59 ½ cannot withdraw these amounts unless the employee has a financial hardship.  A financial hardship is an immediate and heavy financial need for which the employee has no other available resources, and includes medical expenses, the purchase of a primary residence, the payment of tuition and related educational fees, funeral expenses of an immediate family member, and the need to prevent eviction from, or foreclosure of the mortgage of, the employee's primary residence.  The employee will be required to present evidence of the financial hardship and upon submission of such evidence may be entitled to withdraw an amount, up to the 401(k) contribution basis in the employee's account, plus the vested value of Employer Matching contributions, to meet the immediate financial need.
The amount in an employee's account must be distributed to the employee in one lump sum or in periodic installments beginning no later than April 1st of the year following the year in which the employee retires after reaching age 70½.  Additionally, these amounts must be distributed within a reasonable time following the termination of the 401(k) Plan or, when requested, the termination of the employee's employment.  An actively working employee will be entitled to receive a distribution of the amounts in their account upon the employee's attainment of age 65.  A participating employee may borrow from his or her account subject to certain prescribed limitations.
6     The Internal Revenue Code limits the permissible benefit payments that may be paid under the Retirement Plan. Consequently, the amounts of retirement benefits that actually may be paid to individual employees may be significantly lower than shown, depending on several factors, including but not limited to the employee's years of service, level of compensation, and actual year of retirement.
7        3.00% per year up to 25 years.
8     0.5% per year over 25 years. The following table sets forth the amounts paid or distributed pursuant to the 401(k) Plan in 2017 to the Executive Officers listed in the Compensation Table above, and the amounts deferred and paid as part of HIT expenses, pursuant to the 401(k) Plan for the accounts of such individuals during 2017, the distribution or unconditional vesting of which are not subject to future events.
