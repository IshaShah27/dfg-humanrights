  CSX believes that providing Internet access to our proxy materials increases the ability of our shareholders to review important information about the Company, while reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting.        March 20, 2019 Dear Shareholder: On behalf of the Board of Directors of CSX Corporation, I cordially invite you to attend the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual Meeting") on Friday, May 3, 2019. The meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m. (EDT) and will be hosted online at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CSX2019. We are excited to introduce a virtual meeting format for this year's Annual Meeting that we believe will facilitate expanded shareholder access and participation. To participate in the meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card or on your Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials. I also encourage you to review the 2018 CSX Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes CSX's audited financial statements and additional information about CSX's business. We have elected to provide electronic access to our proxy materials under the Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules, because we believe this offers shareholders the most effective and efficient method for reviewing important information about CSX. Electronic distribution also reduces the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting and supports our sustainability commitment. For additional details about accessing information or the conduct of the Annual Meeting, please see the Questions and Answers section of this Proxy Statement or visit the Annual Meeting of Shareholders section of our Investor Relations website. Even if you do not plan to participate in this year's Annual Meeting, your vote is important. You can make your voice heard by submitting your proxy via the Internet, by phone or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided. I urge you to do so promptly to ensure your shares are represented and voted. If you should later decide to participate in the Annual Meeting, you will be able to vote online, even if you have previously submitted your proxy. Please review the instructions for each of your voting options described in this Proxy Statement as well as in the Notice of Internet Availability you received in the mail or via email. The CSX Board of Directors and leadership team look forward to your participation in the Annual Meeting. Sincerely,  James M. Foote President and Chief Executive Officer

  CSX has considered concerns raised by investor advisory groups and other shareholder rights advocates that virtual meetings may diminish stockholder voice or reduce accountability. Accordingly, we have designed our virtual meeting format to enhance, rather than constrain, shareholder access, participation and communication. CSX believes its virtual meeting will afford a greater number of our shareholders the opportunity to participate in the Annual Meeting while still affording participants the same rights they would have had at an in-person meeting and substantially reducing the time and expense associated with holding an in-person meeting. 
   What if I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the virtual meeting? 
   We will have technicians ready to assist you with any technical difficulties you may have accessing the virtual meeting. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or meeting time, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the Virtual Shareholder Meeting log-in page or at www.proxyvote.com. Technical support will be available starting at 9:00 a.m. EDT on May 3, 2019. 
   Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
   In accordance with rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we may furnish proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report, to our shareholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. Most shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless requested. Instead, the Notice, which was mailed to most of our shareholders, instructs you as to how you may access and review all of the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice also instructs you as to how you may submit your proxy on the Internet. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice. 
   How do I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
● view CSX's proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; and● instruct CSX to send future proxy materials to you electronically by email.

   Who is soliciting my vote? 
   The Board of Directors of CSX (the "Board") is soliciting your vote on matters being submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting. The Company will pay the costs of preparing proxy materials and soliciting proxies, including the reimbursement, upon request, of trustees, brokerage firms, banks and other nominee record holders for the reasonable expenses they incur to forward proxy materials to beneficial owners. In addition to using mail, proxies may be solicited in person, by telephone or by electronic communication by officers and employees of the Company acting without special compensation. 
   Who is entitled to vote? 
   Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof, unless a new record date is set in connection with any such adjournments or postponements. On March 4, 2019, there were issued and outstanding 812,686,737 shares of CSX common stock, the only outstanding class of voting securities of the Company. 
   How many votes do I have? 
   You will have one vote for every share of CSX common stock you owned at the close of business on the Record Date. 
   How many shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? 
   The Company's bylaws provide that a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum at any meeting of shareholders. If a share is represented for any purpose at the Annual Meeting, it is deemed to be present for the transaction of all business. Abstentions and shares held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee that are voted on any matter are included in determining the number of shares present. Shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that are not voted on any matter at the Annual Meeting ("broker non-vote") will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present. Your vote is important and we urge you to vote by proxy even if you plan to participate in the Annual Meeting.

The purpose of this review is to determine whether any such relationships or transactions would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by the director or director nominee in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director, and thus, be inconsistent with a determination that the director or director nominee is independent. The Board also considers the independence of its committee members under applicable tax and securities laws.
In February 2019, after considering Nasdaq listing standards, the Board, upon recommendation from the Governance Committee, determined that the following director nominees are independent under the Nasdaq listing standards: Donna M. Alvarado, Pamela L. Carter, Steven T. Halverson, John D. McPherson, David M. Moffett, Linda H. Riefler, J. Steven Whisler and John J. Zillmer.
PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board is committed to corporate governance principles and practices that facilitate the fulfillment of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that reflect the high standards that employees, investors, customers, suppliers and others should expect. Key corporate governance principles observed by the Board and the Company include:

CSX's Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics are available on the Company's website at http://investors.csx.com under the heading "Corporate Governance." Shareholders may also request a free copy of any of these documents by writing to CSX Corporation, Office of the Corporate Secretary, 500 Water Street, C160, Jacksonville, Florida 32202. Any waivers of or changes to the Code of Ethics that apply to our directors or executive officers will be disclosed on CSX's website at http://www.csx.com. There were no waivers to the Code of Ethics in 2018.
SHAREHOLDER OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
We believe that on-going shareholder engagement is a key component of effective corporate governance that allows the Company to better understand evolving trends and enable strategic decision-making to deliver shareholder value. We conduct shareholder outreach throughout the year to ensure that management and the Board understand and consider our shareholders' views on important issues.
Senior leaders and subject matter experts from the Company meet routinely with representatives from many of our institutional shareholders and periodically with proxy advisory firms to discuss CSX's business strategy, corporate governance practices, executive compensation, and environmental, social and governance matters. Members of the Board participate in these meetings from time to time.
In addition to this shareholder outreach, CSX also engages with shareholders and other interested parties through its participation in industry and investment community conferences, investor road shows, and analyst meetings. In addition, we continue to successfully engage with individual shareholders to advance issues that are in the best interests of our broad and diverse shareholder base.
Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board, or with a particular director, may forward appropriate correspondence to CSX Corporation, Office of the Corporate Secretary, 500 Water Street, C160, Jacksonville, Florida 32202. Pursuant to procedures established by the non-management directors of the Board, the Office of the Corporate Secretary will forward appropriate correspondence to the Board or a particular director. Appropriate correspondence generally includes any legitimate, non-harassing inquiries or statements. Interested parties who wish to communicate with the Chairman of the Board or non-employee directors may forward correspondence to CSX Corporation, the Chairman of the Board, CSX Board of Directors, 500 Water Street, C160, Jacksonville, Florida 32202.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee of the Board has primary responsibility for risk oversight. In addition to regular risk presentations to the Audit Committee, management periodically reports to the Board and its other committees on current risks and the Company's approach to avoiding and mitigating risk exposure.
The Company's Business Risk Management ("BRM") program includes activities related to the identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of risks. The CSX risk universe is divided into the following broad risk categories: 
Compliance — Risks directly impacting CSX's ability to meet or comply with state, federal or local rules and regulations (e.g., environmental laws and regulations); 
Strategic — Risks (and opportunities) directly impacting CSX's ability to achieve or exceed its stated longer term strategic objectives (e.g., market demand shifts); and 
External — Risks arising from events outside CSX and beyond the Company's direct influence or control (e.g., economic downturn, cyber and other security risks).
The objective of the BRM program is to facilitate timely identification and review of new and existing risks along with overseeing the development and execution of mitigation plans. A well-established risk management structure is leveraged to govern the program. Risks are prioritized based on their potential impacts on the Company. On an ongoing basis, risks are evaluated to track the status of key mitigation activities along with the trends of key indicators. Ultimately, the BRM program provides an opportunity for business and functional leadership to collaborate on the key Company risks and identify needed mitigation steps to help advance the Company's objectives.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' ROLE IN SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board is responsible for succession planning for the Board, as well as senior management, including the CEO. In addition to succession planning efforts by the Board and the Governance Committee throughout the year, the full Board engages in a comprehensive management succession planning exercise on an annual basis where it analyzes potential succession candidates across all senior management positions. Although the Board focuses on the senior executive team and CEO succession, directors also discuss the pipeline for other key roles in the Company. As part of this exercise, the Board reviews skills, competencies and readiness levels of succession candidates and recommends development plans to ensure that management succession candidates are adequately prepared for planned and unexpected transitions.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS AND OTHER MATTERS
CSX operates under a Code of Ethics that requires all employees, officers and directors, without exception, to avoid engaging in activities or relationships that conflict, or would be perceived to conflict, with the Company's interests or adversely affect its reputation. It is understood, however, that certain relationships or transactions may arise that would be deemed acceptable and appropriate upon full disclosure of the transaction, following review to ensure there is a legitimate business reason for the transaction and that the terms of the transaction are no less favorable to CSX than could be obtained from an unrelated person. The Audit Committee is responsible for review and oversight of all transactions with related persons. CSX has not adopted written procedures for reviewing Related Person Transactions, but generally follows the procedures described below in accordance with Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
A "Related Person Transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which: (i) CSX (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant; (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any fiscal year; and (iii) any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity).
A "Related Person" includes: (i) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the last fiscal year was, a director or executive officer or a nominee to become a director; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of CSX's voting securities; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of the director, executive officer, nominee or more than 5% beneficial owner, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director, executive officer, nominee or more than 5% beneficial owner; and (iv) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest.
On an annual basis, in response to the Directors and Officers Questionnaire ("Questionnaire") and a Related Person Transaction survey ("Survey"), each director, director nominee and executive officer submits to the Corporate Secretary a description of any current or proposed Related Person Transactions. Directors and executive officers are expected to notify the Corporate Secretary of any updates to the list of Related Person Transactions during the year. If Related Person Transactions are identified, those transactions are reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee will evaluate Related Person Transactions based on:
In connection with the review of any Related Person Transaction, the Audit Committee will consider whether the transaction will be a conflict of interest or give the appearance of a conflict of interest. In the case of any Related Person Transaction involving an outside director or nominee for director, the Audit Committee will also consider whether the transaction will compromise the director's status as an independent director as prescribed in the Nasdaq listing standards. The Audit Committee did not identify any Related Person Transactions during 2018 that are required to be reported pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

Item 1: Election of Directors
ANNUAL EVALUATION OF BOARD PERFORMANCE
The Board believes annual performance reviews are essential for ensuring overall effectiveness, including fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities, strategic planning and communications. For 2018, the Board evaluation process was initiated through detailed questionnaires. Individual director performance is then discussed with committee chairs or the Chairman of the Board, as appropriate. Summaries of the committee-specific feedback are provided to the relevant committee chairs, which are then reviewed with the Chairman of the Board. The Governance Committee reviews the evaluations and recommendations. Each standing committee also conducted an evaluation of its own performance.
MEETINGS OF THE BOARD AND EXECUTIVE SESSIONS
During 2018, there were 7 meetings of the Board. Each of the directors then serving attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served. The non-employee directors met alone in executive session at each regular Board meeting. These executive sessions were chaired by the Chairman of the Board. In accordance with the CSX Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors (when different than non-management directors) meet in executive session at least once a year. While the Company does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at annual shareholder meetings, the Company strongly encourages directors to attend absent an emergency. All but one director attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The Board periodically, but at least once every three years, reviews and sets the compensation for the non-employee directors based on the recommendation of the Governance Committee. Director compensation includes both cash and stock-based components. In recommending the amount and form of director compensation, the Committee considers, among other factors, peer benchmarking data and the level of compensation necessary to attract and retain qualified, independent directors.
Elements of Director Compensation
The following charts show director cash and equity compensation for fiscal year 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Annual grant of CSX common stock in the amount of $150,000 with the number of shares based on the average closing price of CSX common stock in the months of November 2017, December 2017 and January 2018. Effective for 2019, the cash and equity base retainer for non-management directors has been increased to $112,500 and $162,500, respectively. 
(2)  The incremental retainer for the Audit Committee Chair has been increased to $25,000 for 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Each non-employee director was eligible to defer all or a portion of his or her director's fees in 2018, including cash and stock compensation, under the CSX Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Directors' Plan"). Cash deferrals are credited to an unfunded account and invested in various investment choices or deferred as shares of CSX common stock. The investment choices parallel the investment options offered to employees under CSX's 401(k) plan. Stock deferrals are automatically held as outstanding shares in a trust, with dividends credited in the form of shares.

Item 1: Election of Directors
Matching Gift Program and Other Benefits
Non-management directors may participate in the CSX Directors' Matching Gift Program, which is considered an important part of CSX's philanthropy and community involvement. CSX will match director contributions to organizations that qualify for support under Company guidelines, up to a maximum annual CSX contribution of $50,000 per non-employee director per year. During 2018, six philanthropic organizations in areas served by the Company collectively received $230,000 under the Directors' Matching Gift Program.
Non-employee directors also are eligible to receive other compensation and benefits as discussed below. The CEO does not receive compensation for his services as a director.
2018 DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION TABLE
The following table summarizes the compensation of each of the non-employee directors in 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Fees Earned or Paid in Cash – Includes a cash retainer of $100,000 and any Committee Chair or Audit Committee fees earned in 2018. Mr. Moffett elected to defer 100% of his cash retainer and fees in the form of cash into the Directors' Plan. Messrs. Breaux and Whisler elected to defer 100% of their cash retainers and fees in the form of CSX stock into the Directors' Plan. 
(2)  Stock Awards – Amounts disclosed in this column are based on the February 7, 2018 grant date fair value of the annual stock grant to directors calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). The number of shares is based on an award of $150,000 divided by the average closing price of CSX common stock in the months of November 2017, December 2017 and January 2018. All such stock awards to directors vested immediately upon grant. 
(3)  Stock Awards – Mr. Kelly's amount also includes a Non-Executive Chairman stock grant based on the February 7, 2018 grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The number of shares is based on an award of $250,000 divided by the average closing price of CSX common stock in the months of November 2017, December 2017 and January 2018. This stock award vested immediately upon grant. 
(4)  Option Awards – There were no stock options granted to non-employee directors in 2018. 
(5)  All Other Compensation – Includes excess liability insurance, Company match under the Directors' Matching Gift Program and Company contributions under the Directors' Charitable Gift Plan. The only perquisite to exceed $10,000 for any director was the Company match under the Directors' Matching Gift Program, which includes matches in the following amounts: $50,000 for each of Messrs. Halverson, Kelly, Moffett and Whisler and $30,000 for Senator Breaux. 
[END TABLE]
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board has adopted Stock Ownership Guidelines to better align the interests of non-employee directors with the interests of shareholders. Within five years of election to the Board, a non-employee director is expected to acquire and hold an amount of CSX common stock equal in value to five times the amount of such non-employee director's annual cash retainer. If the annual cash retainer increases, the non-employee directors will have five years from the time of the increase to acquire any additional shares needed to satisfy the guidelines. All non-employee directors who have served on the Board for five or more years since their election held a sufficient number of shares to satisfy these guidelines. Further information on the Stock Ownership Guidelines is available on CSX's website at http://investors.csx.com under the heading "Corporate Governance."

All engagements expected to cost $250,000 or more require pre-approval of the full Audit Committee. In addition, it is Company policy that tax and other non-audit services should not equal or exceed base audit fees plus fees for audit-related services. In 2017 and 2018, all services performed by EY were pre-approved.

The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements, for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the quality of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
During 2018, the Audit Committee was comprised solely of independent directors as defined by Nasdaq listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The members of the Audit Committee in 2018, together with appointment dates and meeting attendance, is set forth below:
The meetings of the Audit Committee are designed to facilitate and encourage communication among the Audit Committee, the Company, the Company's internal audit function and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
Each year, the Audit Committee evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and determines whether to re-engage the current independent registered public accounting firm. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, the capabilities of the independent registered public accounting firm, technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's operations and industry. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has retained EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Although the Audit Committee has the authority to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee intends to continue to recommend that the Board ask shareholders to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm at the Annual Meeting.
EY, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, is responsible for expressing an opinion that: (i) the Company's consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States; and (ii) the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

February 6, ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Rail is the most environmentally friendly way to move goods over land, and CSX is working to lessen the environmental impact of its operations.
CSX continues to advance fuel efficiency by investing in a variety of technologies and operational strategies including Trip Optimizer, idle reduction technologies, distributed power, and trailing unit shutdown. Additionally, CSX has an active engine retrofit program in which it rebuilds or remanufactures older locomotives to current emissions standards to improve the overall efficiency and elevate the average tier level of the fleet. In 2017, CSX's fuel efficiency improved to an all-time record – the company moves a ton of freight, on average, 488 miles on a single gallon of fuel.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes the principles of the Company's executive compensation programs, how those principles are applied and how the Company's compensation programs are designed to drive executive performance and create sustainable long-term shareholder value. This CD&A focuses on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") as of December 31, 2018, who are listed below.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
2018 Business Highlights
Building on the introduction of the scheduled railroading operating model in 2017, CSX delivered transformative performance improvement and operating efficiency in 2018. Under the first full year of leadership of President and CEO James M. Foote, the Company continued to drive efficiencies under the new operating model to achieve record operating performance and financial results. In 2018, the Company implemented an organizational realignment of the operating departments, which focused on network simplification while intensifying safety efforts. In addition, the leadership team met with customers and investors to: (i) provide further details on the new operating model, including the Company's commitment to providing an industry-leading service product; (ii) communicate changes taking place; and (iii) build confidence in the model's potential for long-term success.
CSX continues to deliver value to shareholders through a balanced approach to deploying cash that includes investments in the business and distributions to shareholders. In 2018, CSX returned approximately $5.4 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2018, the Company also invested approximately $1.75 billion to further enhance safety, service, capacity and flexibility of its network. In January 2019, the Company announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program.
As a result of the scheduled railroading operating model and the renewed focus on driving a safe, efficient and customer-focused railroad, the Company was able to generate record productivity and profits. Key 2018 business highlights included:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The Scheduled Railroading Operating Model
Based on five foundational principles — operating safely, optimizing asset utilization, controlling costs, improving customer service, and valuing and developing employees — scheduled railroading drives efficiency by streamlining the rail network and simplifying the operating plan. The fundamental difference between traditional railroading and scheduled railroading is that the former focuses on meeting train schedules, whereas scheduled railroading requires CSX to develop a trip plan for each rail car and focuses on moving customers' freight as efficiently as possible by eliminating unnecessary handlings. As a result, the operations team has significantly reduced the number of car handlings that previously slowed the movement of cars across the network and impaired timely service to customers. Much of this was accomplished through a reduction in the number of hump classification yards that process cars from inbound trains and build outbound trains. At the beginning of the scheduled railroading transformation, CSX had twelve hump yards on the network; today it has five.
Scheduled railroading drives efficiency through improved use of assets, with a focus on reducing the time that locomotives and rail cars are not moving freight. As such, the Company has removed more than 1,000 locomotives (approximately 25%) from active service and reduced its number of locomotive shops from ten to five. In addition, the Company has taken more than 22,000 rail cars (approximately 16%) out of the system, which enhances efficiencies and reduces maintenance costs.
Organizational efficiency is a hallmark of scheduled railroading. For example, over the past year, the network's previous nine dispatching offices have been consolidated into one dispatching center in Jacksonville, Florida. While scheduled railroading recognizes that some functions are handled more effectively in a centralized location, another primary tenant of the model is that decision-making is more efficient when it takes place as close as possible to where the work is performed. A major organizational realignment in 2018 created East and West operating territories, each with two operating regions that oversee all three primary operating functions — transportation, mechanical and engineering. In addition, administrative support employees were assigned and relocated to the regions, where they work closely with teams in the field and quickly address local priorities. Another example involved the consolidation of customer service functions, including shipment tracking, problem resolution and transactional systems, into the sales and marketing organization to eliminate redundancies and create a more positive customer experience. These changes have improved customer service and resulted in a more efficient, engaged and productive workforce.
Delivering Results
The efficiencies achieved through the scheduled railroading operating model and improved business practices across the organization have resulted in significantly stronger performance and financial results. Throughout the year, the Company demonstrated that enhanced asset utilization improves service and lowers costs. The simplified network and operating plan contributed to historic lows in average rail car dwell time (the amount of time cars spend in terminals versus moving toward their destinations) and record highs in average train velocity. For 2018, the average dwell time improved 15% to 9.6 hours and velocity improved 19% to 17.9 m.p.h. The correlation between improved efficiency and better service was also reflected in a 26% reduction in locomotive failures despite the closure of half of the railroad's locomotive shops.
As a result of the scheduled railroading operating model, the Company offers a service product that provides capacity to accommodate customers' growth, while offering better supply chain solutions and a more reliable, higher value-added solution for customers' transportation requirements. We are initiating more frequent, transparent communication with customers about service solutions and enhancements. For example, the CSX Customer Engagement Forum is a meeting hosted with select customers and CSX executives to understand customer perspectives on our service and how CSX can leverage the performance improvements of scheduled railroading to add value to their businesses.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The CSX leadership team devoted significant attention and resources to improving the Company's safety performance in 2018. A new chief safety officer was added to the leadership team, and a comprehensive safety assessment was performed by an external safety consultant. The Company adopted a program of safety enhancements that included a renewed focus on operating rules compliance and a revised discipline policy that places greater emphasis on education and training.
With a continued focus on operating and safety performance, CSX delivered record financial results in 2018. The Company reduced its operating ratio — the percentage of every revenue dollar that is used to cover operating expenses — to nearly 60%, eclipsing its 2018 goal. At the same time, revenue increased 7% for the year and operating income increased by 31% year-over-year. The revenue increase was driven in part by economic factors but also reflected improved service. The sales and marketing team pursued profitable new business opportunities based on the added value of a faster and more reliable service product.
Aligned for Success
The Company's incentive pay programs were adjusted in 2018 to more closely align with the principles of the scheduled railroading for the purpose of driving improved performance and delivering value for shareholders. In addition, the changes were designed to motivate and engage employees through emphasis on factors over which they exercise more direct control thereby creating a stronger pay for performance environment.
Led by a strong management focus and clearly defined operating model, CSX employees advanced the Company's scheduled railroading vision throughout 2018, demonstrating to customers and shareholders the effectiveness of the model for achieving industry-leading levels of performance.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES
What are the primary objectives of the Company's executive compensation programs?
The primary objectives of the executive compensation programs are to:
The Compensation Committee (for the purposes of the CD&A, the "Committee") believes that a strong and engaged executive leadership team is critical to driving Company and employee performance and delivering shareholder value. Accordingly, the Committee has designed executive compensation programs to motivate management to drive stronger performance and align compensation with the short-term and long-term success of the Company. When designing the Company's executive compensation programs, the Committee considers shareholder input through the annual say-on-pay vote.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
How do the Company's Executive Compensation Programs Align with Leading Governance Practices?
The Committee has established executive compensation programs that incorporate leading governance principles. Highlighted below are executive compensation practices that drive performance and support strong corporate governance.
What is the role of the Compensation Committee?
The Committee oversees the development and approval of the Company's executive compensation philosophy, strategy and design. The Committee strives to reward performance through compensation plans that appropriately motivate and engage employees and support shareholder value creation while taking into account independent market data and market-competitive practices. In developing performance targets for the short and long-term incentive plans, the Committee reviews, among other factors, the annual and three-year business plans and economic environment. In assessing performance of the NEOs to determine incentive compensation payouts, the Committee conducts a detailed review of business goals and associated results. In accordance with its charter, the Committee may delegate to (i) the CEO or other members of executive management, the authority to adopt, amend or terminate any of the Company's plans, policies or programs, subject to the limitations set forth in the applicable plan, policy or program, (ii) the CEO or the senior human resource officer, acting in consultation with the CEO, the authority to review and approve grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and other stock-related incentives to employees of the Company other than the CEO and other Section 16 officers and (iii) a subcommittee of the Committee, all or a portion of the Committee's duties and responsibilities, consistent with applicable regulations, laws and listing standards.
What data does the Committee consider when determining executive compensation?
The Committee annually evaluates competitive compensation data for the NEOs, including base salary and short and long-term incentives with that of similar positions at peer railroads and general industry companies that are part of the comparator group. For purposes of evaluating targeted compensation amounts for the NEOs, the Committee reviews market data at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the comparator group. The Committee considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating target compensation levels:
In keeping with past practices, the Committee developed a customized comparator group for 2018 comprised of 15 primarily U.S.-based companies and North American railroads (the "Comparator Group") to help guide total compensation decisions at CSX. The Committee annually assesses and approves the Comparator Group to ensure that it reflects market characteristics comparable to those of the Company, including revenue, assets, net income, market capitalization, number of employees, industry type and business complexity. In addition, the Committee reviews the degree of overlap with proxy advisory peer companies. As a result of its review for 2018, the Committee approved the Comparator Group with changes from the prior year. The Company believes the use of the Comparator Group allows for a nuanced analysis of various total compensation components.

What is the role of the independent compensation consultant?
Pursuant to its charter, the Committee has sole authority to select, retain and terminate any consultant used to assist the Committee in fulfilling its duties. The Committee has retained an independent compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (the "Consultant"), to provide objective analysis and to assist in the development and evaluation of the Company's executive compensation programs. The Consultant reports directly to the Committee chair, and generally attends all meetings where the Committee evaluates the overall effectiveness of the executive compensation programs or where the Committee analyzes or approves executive compensation. The Consultant is paid on an hourly fee basis, with such hourly rates approved by the Committee annually.
The Committee reviews the performance and independence of the Consultant on an annual basis, at which time it decides whether to renew the Consultant's annual engagement. Each year, the Committee considers all appropriate information relating to the independence of the Consultant and its professionals involved in the work performed for, and advice provided to, the Committee. In 2018, the Committee determined that: (i) the relationships and work of the Consultant and its professionals did not present any conflict of interest; and (ii) the Consultant and its professionals are independent for the purpose of providing advice to the Committee with respect to matters relating to the compensation of the executives and non-employee directors of the Company.
In 2018, the Consultant's duties and responsibilities included:
How does the Compensation Committee evaluate risk in connection with executive compensation programs?
The Committee believes appropriately structured compensation programs should take into consideration enterprise risks and discourage behavior that leads to inappropriate increases in the Company's overall risk profile. Accordingly, the Committee and its Consultant regularly review the Company's enterprise risks and compensation plan design to consider whether the plans motivate the appropriate behaviors and mitigate unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Each year, the Committee reviews a risk assessment prepared by management and the Consultant that focuses on the structure, key features and risk mitigating factors included in the Company's executive compensation programs. This risk assessment:
The risk assessment, which includes a summary of all executive compensation programs and participation, helps the Committee evaluate: (i) the nature of the risks inherent in the Company's executive compensation programs; and (ii) whether the Company has designed and implemented appropriate risk management processes that foster a culture of risk-awareness. In 2018, this assessment led to a conclusion by management, with the help of the Consultant, that the executive compensation programs of the Company were appropriately designed to mitigate compensation risk. As a result, the Committee believes that any risks arising from its executive compensation policies and practices are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
In addition, the following features of the Company's executive compensation programs serve to mitigate excessive risk-taking:
What are the elements of the Company's 2018 executive compensation programs?
The various components of the Company's compensation programs include base salary and short and long-term incentive compensation. The Company also provides retirement and other employee benefits, non-qualified deferred compensation plans and limited perquisites. The NEOs generally participate in the same benefit programs as all eligible employees.
The Committee makes its decisions concerning the specific compensation elements and total compensation paid or awarded to the Company's NEOs within the framework described herein. The objective is to provide total compensation opportunities that are competitive with those provided by companies in the Comparator Group, with actual payment of incentive compensation dependent upon the achievement of both the Company and individual performance. The Committee bases its decisions on whether each award provides an appropriate incentive for individual performance that is consistent with the Company's executive compensation objectives.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
What is the 2018 target compensation mix for the CEO and other NEOs?
The Company's executive compensation philosophy requires that a substantial portion of total compensation be at-risk and consist of performance-based incentives that link to CSX's financial and operating results. In addition, the Committee strives to strike an appropriate balance between short and long-term compensation. The mix between fixed and variable compensation and short-term and long-term compensation is designed to align the NEOs' financial incentives with shareholder interests. In 2018, approximately 89% of the CEO's targeted Total Direct Compensation and an average of 82% of the other NEOs' targeted Total Direct Compensation was performance-based and at-risk. The at-risk component of executive compensation means that if the Company did not meet or exceed the pre-established threshold performance levels, the executive would not receive a payout under the applicable short or long-term incentive plan.
For 2018, the Company enhanced the mix of long-term incentive compensation for the executive team to be more strongly focused on performance, with long-term incentive compensation comprised of 60% Performance Units and 40% stock options. The chart below illustrates the amount of target Total Direct Compensation, including compensation that is at-risk, for the CEO and the other NEOs. Actual percentages of realized compensation may vary in a given year depending on the payouts under the incentive compensation programs and the Company's stock price performance.
2018 BASE SALARY
How is base salary determined?
The Committee determines a base salary for each executive based on its assessment of the individual's experience, scope of responsibilities, individual performance and long-term shareholder value creation. The Committee also considers salary data for similar positions within the Comparator Group. Base salary may represent a larger or smaller percentage of total compensation if actual Company and individual performance under the short and long-term incentive plans discussed below fall short of or exceed pre-established performance targets.
2018 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
The Company's 2018 Management Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2018 MICP") was designed to reward executives and eligible employees for driving Company performance over a one-year period. As discussed earlier in the CD&A, the Committee annually reviews the goals and measures used to drive business results and create value for shareholders. Each NEO has an incentive opportunity expressed as a percentage of base salary earned during the year ("Target Incentive Opportunity"). In 2018, the Target Incentive Opportunity level for Mr. Foote was 125% of his base salary and the Target Incentive Opportunity level for Messrs. Lonegro, Harris, Wallace and Goldman was 90% of base salary.
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
What were the performance measures for the 2018 MICP?
To determine the payout, the Committee assesses the Company's performance against the performance goals for the year. In 2018, the financial goals for the 2018 MICP continued to focus on operating efficiency. The specific performance goals were operating income and operating ratio. Operating income is used to gauge the general health and profitability of the core business, while operating ratio indicates the efficiency of the Company's operations.
The operating income and operating ratio performance goals can each result in a payment between 0% and 100% of the NEO's Target Incentive Opportunity, and each is weighted 50% of the potential total payout. Therefore, the actual payout can range between 0% and 200% of the NEO's Target Incentive Opportunity. However, a threshold performance level must be achieved on either measure to receive a payout. As shown in the Summary Compensation Table, the actual 2018 payouts were paid in cash and reflect the Company's financial performance and individual NEO performance.
2018 MICP Targets and Potential Payout Percentages
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  The 2018 MICP included a formulaic adjustment to the operating ratio performance goal by a pre-determined amount if the average cost of highway diesel fuel was outside the range of $2.65 to $3.15 per gallon. This adjustment is designed to account for the potential impact that volatile fuel prices have on expenses and operating ratio. Based on an average price per gallon of highway diesel fuel of $3.19 during 2018, the adjusted threshold, target and maximum targets were 66.4%, 64.9%, and 63.6%, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
What was the payout under the 2018 MICP?
The operating income target for 2018 was set at $4.035 billion and the operating ratio target was set at 64.9% (adjusted for actual average price of highway diesel fuel) based on the Company's business plan. For 2018, the Company achieved above-target operating income of $4.869 billion and an above-target operating ratio of 60.3%. Operating income and operating ratio performance resulted in a 200% payout of target incentive opportunities, as both measures exceeded their maximum targets of $4.190 billion and 63.6%, respectively.
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  At the time the 2018 MICP was approved by the Committee, a provision was made for the adjustment of the operating ratio performance goals by a pre-determined amount if the cost of highway diesel fuel was outside the range of $2.65 - $3.15 per gallon. 
[END TABLE]
Similar to how management assesses the performance of all eligible employees, the Committee annually assesses the individual performance of each NEO and determines payout amounts, which were capped at the maximum Company payout of 200% for 2018. The Committee approved a 200% annual incentive payout for all of the NEOs and such payouts were reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table.
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
How has the 2018 MICP contributed to improved Company performance?
The Committee believes that the short-term measures are directly aligned with the Company's financial goals, are well-understood by employees, support our long-term strategy, and help deliver shareholder value and retain critical talent. Improvements in operating performance have been driven by the adoption of the scheduled railroading operating model. The Committee believes that sustained improvements in operating efficiencies will continue to play a critical role in the continued creation of shareholder value.
Does the 2018 MICP have a clawback provision?
Payouts made under the 2018 MICP may be subject to recovery or clawback, and an employee who has received a payout will be required to promptly return the monies (or any portion of the monies requested by the Company) in each of the following circumstances: (i) if it is determined that the employee engaged in misconduct, including but not limited to, dishonesty, fraud (including reporting inaccurate financial information), theft, or other serious misconduct as determined by the Company, or (ii) if the payout is otherwise required to be recovered by law or court order (i.e. garnishment).
The 2018 MICP contains provisions requiring NEOs to repay the Company portions of any payment received if: (i) within the two-year period following the receipt of the payment, the Company is required to restate its financial statements due to accounting irregularities; and (ii) the payment amount received exceeded the otherwise proper payment based on the restated financials.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
Long-term incentive compensation is intended to promote behaviors that support business initiatives to drive shareholder value over a multi-year period. This is accomplished by providing equity-based incentives focused on financial performance measures that: (i) have a historically high correlation to shareholder returns; (ii) are within management's direct control; and (iii) encourage long-term commitment to delivering shareholder value. Long-term incentives have been granted under the shareholder-approved 2010 CSX Stock and Incentive Award Plan (the "2010 Stock Plan"). Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual Meeting, the Company adopted the 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan (the "2019 Stock Plan" and together with the 2010 Stock Plan, the "Stock Plans"), under which future awards would be granted.
The 2010 Stock Plans allow for different types of equity-based awards and provide flexibility in compensation design to attract, retain and engage high-performing NEOs and eligible participants. The Committee determines the mix of equity vehicles annually to motivate the appropriate behaviors and align Company and NEO performance to shareholder interests and value creation. The mix has historically included performance units, stock options and/or RSUs to align the NEOs' interests with those of shareholders, and achieve key performance goals and absolute stock price appreciation.
What forms of long-term incentive compensation are granted to NEOs?
A significant portion of the NEOs' compensation is provided under the annual long-term incentive plan ("LTIP"). Each year, a market competitive long-term incentive target grant value is identified for each eligible position level and converted into the appropriate number of performance units, stock options and/or RSUs based on the average closing value of CSX common stock for the full three-month period prior to the grant or the Black-Scholes value for that same period, as applicable. The grants associated with each three-year cycle are reviewed and approved by the Committee each year for all eligible participants, including the NEOs. These grants are made and the performance targets set following the annual Board review of the Company's business plan for the applicable upcoming three-year period.
Each three-year LTIP cycle is comprised of equity-based awards that are designed to emphasize performance while aligning NEO interests with those of shareholders by: (i) linking the payout's value to share price; (ii) focusing on long-term shareholder value creation; (iii) incenting the appropriate behaviors; and (iv) mitigating excessive risk. The three-year performance cycles run concurrently, so the Company may have up to three active cycles during a given year. The 2016-2018 performance cycle closed on December 31, 2018, and was paid out in January 2019. The 2017-2019, 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 cycles remain in progress. For the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 LTIPs, the NEOs received performance units, stock options and RSUs. For the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 LTIPs, the NEOs received performance units and stock options. The removal of RSUs from the LTIP equity mix for NEOs was designed to increase the portion of the LTIP grant subject to performance conditions in further support of our pay-for-performance culture.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Performance Units. Performance units are granted at the beginning of the applicable performance period in accordance with the LTIP, as described below. Awards are paid in the form of CSX common stock at the end of the performance period assuming the attainment of Company performance goals. Performance units are subject to forfeiture if a participant's employment terminates before the end of the performance cycle for any reason other than death, disability, retirement or other limited circumstances, as approved by the Committee. In such instances, participants, other than Messrs. Foote and Harris, receive a pro-rata portion of their award based on the number of months completed in the LTIP cycle. The employment agreements for Messrs. Foote and Harris provide that, in connection with the retirement, their full awards will continue to vest through the end of any outstanding LTIP cycles.
Performance unit payouts for each LTIP cycle, if any, do not occur until approved by the Committee in January of the year following the last year of the three-year performance cycle. These payouts can vary from the target grants in terms of both the number of shares paid out due to financial performance and the market value of CSX common stock at the time of payout compared to the price on the original grant date. Based on actual performance, as discussed below, the performance unit payouts for the NEOs at the end of the performance cycle can range from 0% to 200% of the target grants (the 2019-2021 can range 0% to 225%), and can be of lessor or greater value than the original grant value based on the price of CSX common stock.
Stock Options. Nonqualified stock options require stock price appreciation to deliver any value. As a result, they reinforce leadership's focus on the importance of value creation for shareholders. Stock options provide participants with the right, but not the obligation, to buy CSX stock at an agreed-upon price within 10 years of the date of grant. The exercise price of the stock options is established as the closing stock price on the date of grant. The Stock Plans prohibit the repricing of outstanding stock options without the approval of shareholders. Stock options are subject to forfeiture if a participant's employment terminates before the end of the vesting period for any reason other than death, disability, retirement or other limited circumstances, as approved by the Committee. In such instances, participants receive a pro-rata portion of the award based on the number of months completed in the cycle. The employment agreements for Messrs. Foote and Harris provide that, in connection with their retirement, their full awards will continue to vest in accordance with their terms.
What were the performance measures for the 2016-2018 LTIP?
The 2016-2018 LTIP used operating ratio and return on assets ("ROA") on an equally weighted basis to measure the Company's performance. These measures were selected prior to the implementation of the scheduled railroading operating model.
Operating ratio has a historically high correlation to the Company's stock price and serves as a key financial performance measure for CSX and the railroad industry. As such, the use of operating ratio has strengthened participants' understanding of how they can impact Company performance and drive operating efficiency. Long-term improvements in operating ratio have increased operating income and earnings, and created value for shareholders. ROA was chosen as a performance measure to drive efficient asset utilization. Operating ratio and ROA were each weighted 50% of the total payout opportunity and were measured independently of the other.
The threshold, target and maximum payouts for each measure are 10%, 50% and 100%, respectively, generating a total target payout of 100% and a maximum possible payout of 200% for the 2016-2018 LTIP. The 2016-2018 LTIP measured cumulative operating ratio and average ROA over a 12-quarter period from January 2016 through December 2018. The ROA goals required a minimum capital spend of $6 billion during the cycle.
In addition to operating ratio and ROA, the Committee maintained downward discretion on the payouts for NEOs who received this grant (Messrs. Lonegro and Goldman) based on relative total shareholder return ("Relative TSR"). If the Company's 2016-2018 Relative TSR was in the bottom quartile of any of three different performance comparison groups for the 12-quarter period, the Committee had discretion to reduce the payout by up to 30%.
The Committee recognizes that operating ratio is a measure in the short and long-term plans, but believes inclusion in both plans (beginning in 2017 with the implementation of scheduled railroading for the short-term plan) reflects the criticality of the alignment between operating ratio and the focus on operating efficiencies as a key principle of scheduled railroading. The Committee does not believe this overlap will create inappropriate risk-taking since the measurement periods are different (one vs. three years), and operational measures and reviews are in place to monitor risk. The Committee annually reviews the measures used for each short and long-term incentive cycle, and makes changes as appropriate.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
What were the financial goals for the 2016-2018 LTIP?
The LTIP targets for the 2016-2018 LTIP were set to provide an incentive to continue growing long-term shareholder value. The goals were set in February 2016 based on the three-year business plan at the time of the adoption and preceded the leadership change and implementation of scheduled railroading. At the time of approval of the 2016-2018 LTIP, the Company was forecasting an operating ratio for 2016, of 72.7%, which was higher than the prior year operating ratio of 69.7%. This projection was based on a forecasted 4% decrease in freight volume in 2016, driven largely by anticipated declines in coal and crude oil volumes. The cumulative operating ratio for the 2016-2018 LTIP was projected to be between 71.0% and 72.0%.
Based on these assumptions, the targets under the 2016-2018 LTIP were as follows:
At the time the 2016-2018 LTIP was approved by the Committee, a provision was made for the adjustment of the operating ratio performance goals by a pre-determined amount if the average cost of highway diesel fuel was outside the range of $2.62 - $3.12 per gallon. A similar adjustment is included in the plan design for each LTIP due to the significant impact volatile fuel prices have on expenses and operating ratio. Based on an average price per gallon of highway diesel fuel of $2.72 during the 2016-2018 LTIP, no operating ratio goal adjustments were made.
Beginning in 2017, the Company's operating model was substantially changed with the implementation of scheduled railroading, which shifted focus to improved efficiencies and cost reduction. These changes had an overwhelmingly positive impact on operating performance, earnings, and shareholder value creation.
What was the actual payout for the 2016-2018 LTIP?
Based on a cumulative operating ratio of 65.0% and an average ROA of 8.03% for the cycle, the 2016-2018 LTIP was paid out at 200% in January 2019. The Company's Relative TSR performance against the S&P 500, S&P 500 Transportation Industry and peer railroads was in the top quartile of all three comparison groups for the cycle, so the Committee determined that there was no basis for a downward adjustment and did not exercise its downward discretion in this regard. Messrs. Foote, Harris and Wallace did not receive a payout under the 2016-2018 LTIP since they were not employed with CSX in 2016, when the cycle and awards were approved and granted by the Committee.
What are the performance measures for the outstanding LTIPs?
Similar to the 2016-2018 LTIP, the 2017-2019 LTIP uses operating ratio and ROA on an equally weighted basis to measure the Company's performance. Beginning with the 2018-2020 LTIP, ROA was replaced with free cash flow, which is a key driver of total shareholder return and can be impacted by all employees. The 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 LTIPs use operating ratio and free cash flow on an equally weighted basis to measure the Company's performance. In determining the performance measures for each cycle, the Committee: (i) considers information on various return-based measures; and (ii) actively monitors the appropriateness of shifting measures to further the Company's business strategies and drive shareholder returns.
The 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 LTIPs are comprised of performance units and nonqualified stock options. The LTIP mix was achieved by determining a market competitive LTIP grant value and allocating 60% of the value to performance units, and 40% to stock options to continue to drive shareholder value in a pay-for-performance culture. The performance units for these two LTIP cycles have a formulaic linear upward or downward Relative TSR modifier of up to 25%, which applies only to the NEOs; however, the payouts are limited to a maximum of 200% and 225% for the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 LTIPs, respectively. This modifier is designed to appropriately align NEO payouts with share price performance relative to a transportation-related peer group.
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Does the LTIP have a clawback provision?
The clawback provision in each LTIP requires that the NEOs repay to the Company amounts in excess of an otherwise proper award in the event that the Company is required to restate its financial statements due to accounting irregularities discovered within three years after an LTIP payout.
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
Does the Company have separate employment agreements for the NEOs?
In connection with the leadership changes in 2017 and 2018, the Company provided individual employment letter agreements to Messrs. Foote, Harris and Wallace. Mr. Foote had an employment agreement upon his hiring as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in October 2017, which was canceled pursuant to a letter agreement entered into upon his promotion to President and CEO in December 2017, except for certain provisions relating to: (i) severance benefits; (ii) vesting of long-term incentive awards after retirement; and (iii) employment benefits following a change of control.
Messrs. Harris and Wallace received employment letter agreements upon their recruitment and relocation to the Company's headquarters. These agreements remain in place. No other NEOs have individual employment agreements. All individual employment agreements have been filed and can be reviewed on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov.
Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreements:
Vice presidents and above, including the President and CEO and executive vice presidents, as well as certain other key employees, are required to enter into formal non-compete and non-solicitation agreements with the Company as a condition for participation in each LTIP cycle. The non-compete agreements preclude an executive from working for a competitor of the Company. The non-compete conditions extend for a period of 18 months following separation from employment.
SEVERANCE AND CHANGE-OF-CONTROL AGREEMENTS
Are NEOs eligible for severance benefits?
Yes. As of December 31, 2018, each NEO was eligible for certain severance benefits under the Company's "Section 16 Officer Severance Plan," which expired on February 22, 2019, or his employment agreement, as applicable.
Mr. Foote is eligible for the following severance benefits under his employment letter agreement with the Company dated December 22, 2017:
As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Lonegro and Goldman each were eligible for the following severance benefits under the Section 16 Officer Severance Plan: 
The Section 16 Officer Severance Plan provided eligible executives with severance payments and benefits in the event that an individual's employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries was terminated involuntarily by the Company other than "for cause" or terminated voluntarily by the eligible employee for "good reason" (each as defined in the Section 16 Officer Severance Plan). Following expiration of the Section 16 Officer Severance Plan on February 22, 2019, Messrs. Lonegro and Goldman were eligible for benefits under the Company's general severance policy available to all management employees. Under the general severance policy, the NEOs are eligible to receive: (i) up to one year's salary for 20 or more years of service; (ii) continuation of medical and dental coverage for up to one year if periodic separation payments are selected; (iii) financial planning for up to 1 year; and (iv) proration of certain outstanding incentive awards.
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Messrs. Harris and Wallace negotiated separate employment letter agreements upon their recruitment and relocation to the Company's headquarters, and as a result have different severance benefits. In the event their employment is terminated by the Company other than "for cause" or terminated by the executive for "good reason," they are entitled to receive the benefits outlined below.
The severance benefits for Mr. Harris include:
The severance benefits for Mr. Wallace include:
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an NEO is entitled to severance benefits under his respective Change-of-Control Agreement, he shall not be entitled to the severance benefits outlined above. Severance amounts that would have been payable had the NEOs terminated employment with the Company as of December 31, 2018 are described herein.
Does the Company provide Change-of-Control Agreements to its NEOs?
Yes. The Company provides "double-trigger" change of control benefits pursuant to agreements that are designed to ensure management objectivity as it makes strategic business decisions. The Company's policy for severance benefits upon a change-of-control: (i) requires a "double-trigger" (i.e., payments are conditioned upon a change-of-control as well as separation from employment) to receive severance; (ii) prohibits Company reimbursement for the payment of excise taxes; (iii) defines "bonus" as the current "target" amount; and (iv) requires a contract term not to exceed three years. The policy also provides that the payment of severance benefits, without shareholder approval, is limited to 2.99 times base salary plus bonus for NEOs.
All NEOs are subject to the terms of the change-of-control agreements described above and as further detailed under the section entitled "Post-Termination and Change-of-Control Payments."
BENEFITS
What types of Retirement, Health and Group Benefits are provided to the NEOs?
Retirement Programs:
CSX's retirement programs consist of two components: a defined contribution 401(k) plan and a defined benefit pension plan. The retirement programs described below are provided to the NEOs under the following plans:
CSXtra Plan
The NEOs, along with all other CSX non-union employees, may contribute to the CSXtra Plan, a defined contribution 401(k) plan. Participants may contribute on a pre-tax and after-tax basis and receive Company matching contributions. The Company's matching contribution is equal to 100% on the employee's first 1% contribution, and 50% on the employee's additional contributions up to 6% of base salary, for a Company match up to 3.5%. Participants may invest contributions in various investment funds.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Pension Plan
The Pension Plan is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and covers the NEOs and all of CSX's non-union employees. In general, pension benefits accrue in two different ways: (i) for employees externally hired or promoted from CSX union positions on or after January 1, 2003, benefits accrue based on a "cash balance" formula; and (ii) for employees externally hired or promoted from CSX union positions before January 1, 2003, benefits accrue based on a "final average pay" formula. Mr. Lonegro is the only NEO under the "final average pay" formula. All other NEOs are under the "cash balance" formula. Further information on the Pension Plan can be found in the discussion following the Pension Benefits Table.
Special Retirement Plan
The Special Retirement Plan is a nonqualified plan for all employees, including the NEOs, whose base salary and short-term incentive exceeds the current year IRS compensation limit. The Special Retirement Plan primarily provides benefits that are otherwise limited under the Pension Plan due to the qualified plan Code provisions. Further information on the Special Retirement Plan can be found in the discussion following the Pension Benefits Table.
Health and Group Benefits:
CSX provides the same health and group benefits to the NEOs as those available to all non-union employees. The Company also provides basic life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage to all management employees, each of which is equal to two times their respective annual salaries, up to $1 million. The Company also provides NEOs, on the same basis as other management employees, salary continuance in the event of short-term or long-term disability, travel accident insurance and vacation based on length of service.
CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan for management employees hired or promoted from a union position prior to January 1, 2003. Only Mr. Lonegro is eligible for benefits under the post-retirement medical plan. The Company stopped providing post-retirement medical benefits for all management employees, including executive-level employees, hired or promoted from a union position on or after that date.
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan:
CSX offers a voluntary, nonqualified Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP") for the benefit of its executives and other eligible employees. The purpose of the EDCP is to provide participants with the opportunity to:
Under the EDCP, participants are entitled to voluntarily elect to defer up to: (i) 75% of base pay; (ii) 100% of awards payable in cash under CSX's short-term incentive plans; and (iii) 100% of performance units payable under the Company's LTIP in the form of stock. Participants also are entitled to receive matching contributions that would have been received under CSX's 401(k) plan assuming that: (i) certain compensation limits prescribed by the Code did not apply; and (ii) contributions made under the EDCP were instead made under CSX's 401(k) plan.
In accordance with a participant's individual elections, deferred amounts, other than stock awards, are treated as if they were invested among the investment funds available under the qualified 401(k) plan. Participants may elect to change the investment of deferred amounts, other than deferred stock awards.
EDCP participants may elect to receive payment of their deferred amounts, including earnings, upon separation from service, the attainment of a specified date or upon a change-of-control. Participants may elect to receive payment in the form of a lump sum or in semi-annual installments over a period of up to 20 years.
A participant may apply for accelerated payment of deferred amounts in the event of certain hardships and unforeseeable emergencies. A participant also may elect to receive accelerated distribution of amounts deferred before January 1, 2005 (and earnings thereon) other than for hardship or an unforeseeable emergency, but the participant is required to forfeit a percentage of the amount to be distributed. Under the EDCP, cash deferrals are distributed in the form of cash and deferred stock awards are paid in the form of CSX common stock.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2018, shareholders approved the CSX Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which provides eligible employees the right to purchase shares of CSX common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. All employees who have been employed by the Company at least 30 days prior to the beginning of the enrollment period are eligible to participate in the ESPP.
Under the ESPP, employees may purchase shares at the lesser of: (i) 85% of the fair market value of a share of CSX common stock on the grant date; and (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share of CSX common stock on the expiration date. The ESPP limits the number of shares of CSX common stock that an employee may purchase in a calendar year to a number of shares that have a fair value (as of the applicable grant date) equal to $25,000.
What perquisites were provided to the NEOs in 2018?
The perquisites provided to NEOs in 2018 included: (i) financial planning services of $12,000; (ii) excess liability insurance; and (iii) an annual health and well-being examination. These perquisites were valued at approximately $15,000 for each NEO.
Additionally, pursuant to Company policy, Mr. Foote, as CEO, is required to travel by Company aircraft at all times for security purposes and to ensure efficient use of his time. Other senior-level executives have access to the Company aircraft and may use it on a limited basis for personal reasons. The amounts related to the NEO's use of the Company aircraft are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table.
Does the Company have stock ownership guidelines for the NEOs?
Yes. CSX believes that, in order to align the interests of management with those of its shareholders, it is important that NEOs and other senior leaders hold a significant ownership position in CSX common stock relative to their base salary. To achieve this linkage, CSX has established the following formal stock ownership guidelines.
Each of the individuals covered by these guidelines must retain 100% of their net shares issued until the guidelines are achieved and have five years in which to do so.
Does the Company have an anti-hedging / anti-pledging policy?
Yes. CSX's insider trading policy prohibits officers and directors from entering into transactions to hedge their ownership positions in CSX securities. In addition, the policy prohibits officers and directors from pledging CSX securities. The Mantle Ridge group of entities, which are controlled by Mr. Hilal, pledged shares of CSX common stock as collateral under a secured credit facility with a third-party lender prior to Mr. Hilal becoming a director.

2018 OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR END
The table below presents information pertaining to all outstanding equity awards held by the NEOs as of December 31, 2018. Stock awards are comprised of outstanding performance units, stock options, RSUs and restricted stock.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested—The units reflected in this column represent RSUs granted in February 2016 and 2017 that will vest in 2019 and 2020,  respectively, assuming continued employment. This column also includes 19,395 shares of restricted stock awarded to Mr. Lonegro in February 2016 that will vest in February 2021; also included are 23,074 and 30,765 shares of restricted stock awarded to  Messrs. Harris and Wallace, respectively, in August 2018 that will vest in August 2021; and 23,734 shares of restricted stock awarded to Mr. Goldman in May 2016 that will vest in May 2019. 
(3)  Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested—In accordance with the SEC requirements for this table, the number of shares shown in the  column above represents the sum of the performance units that would be payable under the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 LTIPs if the Company's cumulative performance through 2018 was applied to each plan's performance measures. The Company's  2018 performance would have resulted in a 200% payout for the 2017-2019 LTIP and 200% for the 2018-2020 LTIP, even though these cycles are not yet complete. Because this performance would have exceeded the target performance goals, the SEC requires that  projected payouts be shown at the next higher performance measure; therefore, the number of performance units shown is equal to the maximum payout for both the 2017-2019 LTIP (200%) and the 2018-2020 LTIP (200%). 
(4)  Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested—The market values are based on the Company's closing stock price as  of December 31, 2018, the last trading day of 2018, of $62.13.

Cash Balance Formula for Employees Hired on or After January 1, 2003
Non-union employees who become eligible to participate in the Pension Plan on or after January 1, 2003 earn pension benefits under the cash balance formula. These benefits are expressed in the form of a hypothetical account balance. For each month of service, the participant's account is credited with a percentage of the participant's pay for that month. The percentage of pay credited is determined based on the participant's age and years of service. Messrs. Foote, Goldman, Harris and Wallace are covered under the Cash Balance Pay Formula as described below.
The hypothetical account earns interest credits on a monthly basis based on the annual 10-year Treasury bond rate and the participant's account balance as of the end of the prior month. The average annual interest crediting rate used for 2018 was 3.66%. The resulting benefit is subject to a cap imposed under Section 415 of the Code (the "415 Limit"). The 415 Limit for 2018 was $220,000 (for a life annuity at age 65) and is subject to adjustment for future cost of living changes. Further, under the Code, the maximum amount of pay that may be taken into account for any year is limited. This limit (the "Compensation Limit") is $275,000 for 2018 and is also subject to adjustment for future cost of living changes.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Final Average Pay Formula
For management employees hired or promoted from a union position prior to January 1, 2003, the final average pay formula provides for a benefit in the form of a life annuity starting at age 65. The compensation used under this formula includes the highest aggregate base salary and short-term incentive payments for the employee's highest consecutive 60-month period. The benefit is equal to 1.5% of the employee's final average pay multiplied by their years of CSX service. This amount is then reduced by 40% of the employee's Social Security benefits or 60% of the employee's Railroad Retirement benefits, or both, as applicable. Mr. Lonegro was hired before January 1, 2003, and as such, is eligible for benefits based on the final average pay formula. He is the only NEO under this formula. The 415 Limit and Compensation Limit also apply in determining benefits under the final average pay formula.
Special Retirement Plan of CSX and Affiliated Corporations
The Special Retirement Plan is a nonqualified plan that covers CSX employees, including the NEOs, whose compensation exceeds the Compensation Limit. The purpose of the Special Retirement Plan is to assist CSX in attracting and retaining key executives by allowing the Company to offer competitive pension benefits.
The formula duplicates the qualified plan formula but provides for the payment of benefits that would otherwise not be provided under the Pension Plan due to the 415 Limit and the Compensation Limit, both described above.
Nonqualified pension benefits can be paid in the same form as under the Pension Plan. Pension benefits under the Special Retirement Plan are subject to: (i) suspension and possible forfeiture if a retired executive competes with the Company or engages in acts detrimental to the Company; or (ii) forfeiture if an executive is terminated for engaging in acts detrimental to the Company.
The valuation method and actuarial factors used to determine the present value of accumulated benefits shown in the Pension Benefits Table for the Special Retirement Plan are described in the 2018 Annual Report.

POTENTIAL PAYOUTS UNDER CHANGE-OF-CONTROL AGREEMENTS
The following table presents the severance benefits to which each of the NEOs would be entitled as of December 31, 2018, under his or her Change-of-Control Agreement upon the hypothetical termination of employment following a change-of-control: (i) by CSX other than for "cause" or "disability"; (ii) by the NEO for "good reason"; or (iii) upon a "constructive termination." A change-of-control would not result in retirement benefit increases or excise tax gross ups. Further, the pro-rata bonus payment would be based on target bonus instead of the highest annual bonus.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Severance—Severance payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of the NEO's annual base salary at the time of the termination and the "target bonus".  
(2)  Pro-rata Bonus Payment—The "annual bonus" based upon the Executive's target incentive opportunity and the plan's achievement percentage pro-rated for the number of  days in the calendar year prior to a hypothetical termination of employment as of December 31, 2018. 
(3)  Equity—Full LTIP performance unit payout based on 100% attainment of target levels under the 2016-2018, 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 LTIPs; full vesting of outstanding RSUs and restricted stock  awards; as well as the value of outstanding stock options, each based upon the closing stock price on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of 2018, of $62.13. 
(4)  Welfare Benefit Values—Estimated values associated with the continuation of medical, prescription, dental, disability, employee life, group life, accidental death and travel accident  insurance for three years post-termination following a change-of-control.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Termination Without "Cause," Resignation for "Good Reason" or "Constructive Termination."
CSX will pay to the NEO the severance benefits described below if, during the Employment Period, CSX terminates the NEO's employment without "cause", the NEO resigns for "good reason" or upon a "constructive termination." An NEO whose employment is terminated without "cause" in anticipation of a change-of-control is also entitled to the following benefits.
Cash Severance Payment—A lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of the following:
Medical and Other Group Benefits—The equivalent of continued medical and life insurance and other health and group benefits coverage for three years after termination of employment at a level at least as favorable as the benefits provided to the NEO during the Employment Period (or the benefits then generally available to peer executives, whichever is more favorable).
Outplacement—Outplacement services at a cost to CSX not to exceed $20,000.
Termination for Other Reasons—If the executive's employment is terminated due to the executive's death or disability, or voluntarily by the executive, CSX will make a lump sum cash payment equal to the executive's accrued pay (which includes unpaid base salary and unused vacation). If the executive's employment is terminated by CSX for "cause," CSX will pay the executive a lump-sum cash payment of any unpaid portion of his or her annual base salary through the date of termination.
Definitions:
"Cause" generally refers to: (i) the willful and continued failure of the NEO to perform his or her duties to CSX; or (ii) the willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to CSX.
"Constructive termination" applies in the case of a business combination subject to the approval of the Surface Transportation Board, and refers to the occurrence of any of the following during the portion of the Employment Period prior to that agency's final decision:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the substantial diminution of the NEO's duties or responsibilities; 
● a reduction in compensation payable during the Employment Period (other than a reduction in incentive opportunities, benefits and perquisites where the NEO's peer executives suffer a comparable reduction); 
● CSX's requiring the NEO to be based more than 35 miles from his or her location or to travel on business to a materially greater extent than before; or 
● any purported termination by CSX of the NEO's employment other than for "cause."    
"Disability" generally refers to the NEO's absence from duties for 180 consecutive business days as a result of total and permanent mental or physical illness. "Good reason" generally refers to the occurrence of any of the following:     
"Disability" generally refers to the NEO's absence from duties for 180 consecutive business days as a result of total and permanent mental or physical illness. "Good reason" generally refers to the occurrence of any of the following:

Compensation Committee
Steven T. Halverson (Chair) Donna M. Alvarado Linda H. Riefler John J. Zillmer
March 12, As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company is providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation of CSX's median employee and the annual total compensation of Mr. Foote as of December 31, 2018. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
For 2018, the last completed fiscal year:
Due to changes in the Company's workforce from 2017, the Company identified a new median employee as of year-end 2018. To identify the median employee, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of Mr. Foote, the following analysis occurred:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company's employee population consisted of approximately 22,475 employees (as reported in Item 1, Business, in the 2018 Annual Report filed with the SEC on February 6, 2019). The Company used December 31, 2018 as the date to determine the "median employee" because this date provides the most accurate representation of the Company's workforce through the full fiscal year. 
 2.  The median employee was identified by using 2018 Medicare Wages for all individuals, excluding Mr. Foote, that were reflected in the Company's payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Forms W-2 for 2018. 
 3.  All employees who were full-time, part-time, or seasonal, including management and union, as well as furloughed employees who received any wages within the calendar year were included in the analysis. Employees from the Company's consolidated subsidiaries were also included. 
 4.  Annualized compensation was determined for any full or part-time employees who were employed at year-end but did not work for the Company the entire fiscal year. 
 5.  The use of Medicare Wages is a consistently applied measure because it includes all forms of taxable compensation, which is most representative of the Company's employee base since there are union and management workforces. All non-U.S. employees who reside in Canada (49) and Mexico (5) represent less than 1% of the Company's overall employee population and were thus excluded. No cost-of-living adjustments were made in identifying the median employee. 
 6.  Once the median employee was identified, the Company determined the sum of all elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, which resulted in annual total compensation of $105,169. The difference between such employee's base salary, wages, and overtime pay ($85,901) and the employee's total annual compensation was the value of the health care benefits for the employee and eligible dependents, which was $19,268. 
 7.  The annual total compensation for Mr. Foote includes the amount reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement which was determined in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, plus the added value of his health care benefits, which was $11,388. This resulted in total annual compensation of $13,781,988 for Mr. Foote. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, CSX is providing shareholders with the opportunity to vote on a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs, which is disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K and described in the CD&A section, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosures in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the following resolution will be submitted for a shareholder vote at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of CSX Corporation (the "Company") approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure in the Proxy Statement."
The Company currently holds an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's NEOs on an annual basis (in accordance with the results of the advisory shareholder vote held at the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting to determine the frequency of an advisory vote on NEO compensation), and will continue to hold the vote annually until the next frequency vote is held (which is not required until 2023).
As described in the CD&A, the Company's executive compensation program is designed to align executive pay with the Company's financial performance and the creation of sustainable long-term shareholder value. The compensation program is structured to provide a competitive level of compensation necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced executives and to motivate them to achieve short and long-term strategic goals. In order to align executive pay with the Company's financial performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value, a significant portion of compensation paid to our NEOs is allocated to performance-based, long-term equity incentive awards. The Company makes compensation payout decisions based on an assessment of the Company's performance, as well as the performance of each executive against goals that promote CSX's success by focusing on shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which we operate.
Shareholders are urged to read the CD&A, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure in this Proxy Statement, which more thoroughly discuss the Company's compensation policies and procedures. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that these policies and procedures are effective in implementing the Company's overall pay-for-performance compensation philosophy.
While this advisory vote is required by law, it will neither be binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board, nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional fiduciary duties on, the Company or the Board. The Board and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when developing future executive compensation programs. The Company currently intends to hold the next advisory (non-binding) vote to approve NEO compensation at its 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, unless the Board modifies its policy of holding an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs on an annual basis.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders vote FOR this proposal. 
[END TABLE]

In its efforts to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, the Company provides equity-based incentive awards designed to align employee interests with those of shareholders. In this regard, the Board is seeking shareholder approval of the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2019 Stock Plan"), which gives the Company the ability to provide these incentives through issuances of stock, restricted stock, stock options, and other stock-based awards. The 2019 Stock Plan is intended to replace the Company's existing equity compensation plan, the CSX Stock and Incentive Award Plan (as amended, the "2010 Stock Plan"), which was previously approved by shareholders.
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE 2019 STOCK PLAN
In designing the 2019 Stock Plan, the Board and the Compensation Committee carefully considered the Company's anticipated future equity needs, historical equity compensation practices and the advice of the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. The aggregate number of shares of CSX common stock, $1.00 par value ("Shares") being requested for authorization under the 2019 Stock Plan pursuant to awards granted after the 2019 Stock Plan's approval is 28 million Shares. If the 2019 Stock Plan is approved by shareholders, the 2019 Stock Plan will replace the 2010 Stock Plan (which is the only equity plan of the Company in place as of the date of this Proxy Statement), and no additional grants will be made under the 2010 Stock Plan. Among the factors considered by the Compensation Committee in determining the share reserve under the 2019 Stock Plan were the following: 
Table of Contents
Item 4: Vote to Approve the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan 
If approved, the 28 million Shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan would, when combined with Shares subject to outstanding equity awards under the 2010 Stock Plan as reflected in the table above, increase the overhang percentage to approximately 4%. As noted above, if the 2019 Stock Plan is approved by shareholders, no additional equity awards will be granted under the 2010 Stock Plan after the date of the Annual Meeting and all such future awards will be granted under the 2019 Stock Plan.

The 2019 Stock Plan has been designed to build upon the effectiveness of the 2010 Stock Plan and incorporates additional corporate governance best practices to further align the Company's equity compensation programs with the interests of shareholders. Some of the corporate governance best practices included in the 2019 Stock Plan, or that relate to stock ownership, are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Minimum vesting requirements. The 2019 Stock Plan requires awards to be subject to a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant, with only narrow exceptions, which the Company believes strengthens employees' interest in creating long-term value for shareholders. 
   No repricings. Repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") is not permitted without shareholder approval, except for adjustments with respect to certain specified extraordinary corporate transactions. 
   No "liberal" share counting provisions. Shares underlying any award granted under the 2019 Stock Plan that is forfeited, cancelled, expires, terminates or otherwise lapses or is settled in cash are added back to the Share reserve; however, the following Shares are not added back to the share reserve under the 2019 Stock Plan: (i) Shares that are withheld to satisfy the exercise price of a stock option or any applicable tax withholding obligations, (ii) Shares that are subject to a stock-settled SAR that are not issued upon the exercise of such SAR and (iii) Shares that are repurchased by the Company on the open market with option proceeds. 
   Clawback of awards. The 2019 Stock Plan provides the Compensation Committee with the authority to subject awards granted under the 2019 Stock Plan to any clawback or recoupment policies that the Company has in effect from time to time. 
   Stock ownership guidelines. The Company's executive officers (including all NEOs) and directors are subject to share ownership guidelines to ensure that they face the same downside risk and upside potential as shareholders. Additional details regarding the Company's share ownership guidelines are included in the CD&A. 
[END TABLE]
The following paragraphs summarize the material terms of the 2019 Stock Plan, including the provisions regarding eligibility, the types of awards that may be made, the performance criteria that may be applied to awards. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2019 Stock Plan attached hereto as Appendix A.
GENERAL
The 2019 Stock Plan provides for the grants of stock options (both nonqualified and incentive stock options), SARs, RSUs, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalents and other cash- and stock-based awards (collectively, "Incentive Awards") to the Company's employees, non-employee directors and individual consultants. Any award may be granted alone or in tandem with other awards, and may be granted in addition to, or in substitution for, other types of awards. Compensation payable to Board members in the form of Shares will also be paid from the 2019 Stock Plan.
STOCK SUBJECT TO 2019 STOCK PLAN; ADJUSTMENTS
The Board has reserved a total of 28 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan. If an Incentive Award is forfeited, cancelled, expires, terminates or is otherwise settled in cash without the issuance of Shares, the Shares subject to such awards will become available for further awards under the 2019 Stock Plan. Shares (i) tendered or withheld in payment of an exercise price of a stock option or to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with an award, (ii) subject to a stock-settled SAR granted under the 2019 Stock Plan that were not issued upon the exercise of such SAR, and (iii) repurchased by the Company on the open market with option proceeds in respect of the exercise of a stock option will not again be available for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan.

Item 4: Vote to Approve the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan 
In the event the Compensation Committee determines that, as a result of any dividend or other distribution (other than an ordinary dividend or distribution), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, separation, rights offering, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of Shares pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affecting Shares, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, an adjustment is appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2019 Stock Plan, the Compensation Committee will adjust equitably any or all of: (i) the number and type of Shares or other securities that thereafter may be made the subject of awards, including the aggregate limits under the 2019 Stock Plan; (ii) the number and type of Shares or other securities subject to outstanding awards; and (iii) the grant, purchase, exercise or hurdle price for any award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding award.
Purpose
The purpose of the 2019 Stock Plan is to motivate and reward employees and other individuals to perform at the highest level and contribute significantly to the success of the Company, thereby furthering the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Eligibility
The Company's employees, non-employee directors and individual consultants, including advisors, are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Stock Plan to the extent the receipt of such awards is permitted by applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations. As of March 4, 2019, there were approximately 22,314 employees and 10 non-employee directors eligible to receive awards under the 2010 Stock Plan. The average number of individuals who received awards under the Company's 2010 Stock Plan during each of the last three years was approximately 600, although the Compensation Committee reserves the power to make grants more widely in the future. The basis for participation in the 2019 Stock Plan is the Compensation Committee's decision, in its sole discretion, that an Incentive Award to an eligible participant will further the 2019 Stock Plan's purposes of motivating and rewarding participants to perform at the highest level and contribute to the Company's success. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee will consider the recommendations of management and the purposes of the 2019 Stock Plan.
Administration
The 2019 Stock Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, unless another committee is designated by the Board. The Compensation Committee may delegate the authority to grant awards under the 2019 Stock Plan, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to (i) one or more officers of the Company (except that such delegation will not be applicable to any award for a person then covered by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) and (ii) one or more committees of the Board. All decisions of the Compensation Committee are final, conclusive and binding upon all parties.
The Compensation Committee has authority under the 2019 Stock Plan to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● determine the types of Incentive Awards to grant, the number of Shares to be covered by Incentive Awards, the terms and conditions of Incentive Awards, whether Incentive Awards may be settled or exercised in cash, Shares, other awards, other property, net settlement or any combination thereof, the circumstances under which Incentive Awards may be canceled, forfeited or suspended, and whether Incentive Awards may be deferred automatically, or at the election of the holder or the Compensation Committee;  
[END TABLE]

Item 4: Vote to Approve the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan 
Stock Options
The 2019 Stock Plan authorizes the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options are stock options that satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. Nonqualified stock options are stock options that do not satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. Options granted under the 2019 Stock Plan entitle the grantee, upon exercise, to purchase a specified number of Shares from CSX at a specified exercise price per Share. The Compensation Committee determines the period of time during which an option may be exercised, the vesting schedule, the method and form by which each option is to be exercised, and the expiration date of each option, provided that no option will be exercisable more than 10 years after the grant date. The exercise price per Share covered by an option will be determined by the Compensation Committee and may not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant.
Stock Appreciation Rights
The Compensation Committee may grant SARs under the 2019 Stock Plan. Subject to the terms of the award, SARs entitle the participant to receive a distribution in an amount equal to the number of Shares subject to the portion of the SAR exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a Share on the date of exercise of the SAR over the exercise or hurdle price of the SAR. Such distributions are payable in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The terms and conditions applicable to stock options also apply to SARs.
Restricted Stock
The 2019 Stock Plan also authorizes the grant of restricted stock on terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee, which will include the designation of a restriction period during which the shares are not transferable and are subject to forfeiture.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs may be granted subject to terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. In the case of RSUs, no shares are issued at the time of grant. Rather, upon the lapse of any applicable vesting schedule and other restriction, an RSU entitles a participant to receive Shares or cash, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Performance Awards
The Compensation Committee may grant performance awards to participants subject to terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Performance awards may be denominated in cash, Shares or units, or a combination thereof, and may be earned based on the achievement of one or more performance conditions specified by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will make all determinations regarding the achievement of performance goals. Settlement of performance awards will be in cash, Shares, other awards or property, net settlement, or any combination thereof. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, increase or reduce the amount of a settlement to be made in connection with a performance award.
Dividend Equivalents
The 2019 Stock Plan authorizes grants of dividend equivalents to any participant either in combination with, or separately from, Incentive Awards. A dividend equivalent permits the participant to receive payments equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Shares. Dividend equivalents are payable in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Other Cash and Stock-Based Awards
The 2019 Stock Plan authorizes the making of other cash- or stock-based awards. The Compensation Committee will establish the terms and conditions applicable to each award.
Change in Control
The 2019 Stock Plan provides that, upon termination of employment by the employer without cause or by the participant with good reason, within three years after a change in control event:
Table of Contents
Item 4: Vote to Approve the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan 
Duration, Amendment and Termination
The 2019 Stock Plan will automatically terminate on May 3, 2029, if not earlier terminated under the terms of the 2019 Stock Plan. The Board may amend, suspend, discontinue or terminate the 2019 Stock Plan at any time except that no change may be made to the 2019 Stock Plan: (i) without shareholder approval if such approval is required by applicable law or the rules of the stock market or exchange on which the Shares are principally quoted or traded, or (ii) without the consent of the affected participant if such action would materially adversely impact a pending Incentive Award or adversely impact any Incentive Award following a change in control. Accordingly, the Board may generally amend the provisions of the 2019 Stock Plan described in this proposal.
Minimum Vesting Requirements
Each Incentive Award granted pursuant to the 2019 Stock Plan will vest over a period of not less than one year following the date of grant. However, the Compensation Committee may reduce or eliminate this requirement upon the participant's termination of service. In addition, the Compensation Committee may grant awards that are not subject to these minimum vesting requirements with respect to 5% of the maximum aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan (as may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the 2019 Stock Plan).
Prohibition on Repricing
Subject to the adjustment provision described above, the Compensation Committee may not directly or indirectly, through cancellation or regrant or any other method, reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the exercise or hurdle price of any award established at the time of grant without approval of the Company's shareholders.
Restrictions on Transfer; Deferral
Except as otherwise permitted by the Compensation Committee and provided in the Incentive Award, Incentive Awards may not be transferred or exercised by another person except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Cancellation or "Clawback" of Awards
The Compensation Committee may, to the extent permitted by applicable law and stock exchange rules or by any applicable Company policy, cancel or require reimbursement of any Incentive Awards granted, Shares issued or cash received upon the vesting, exercise or settlement of any awards granted under the 2019 Stock Plan or the sale of Shares underlying such awards.
Federal Income Tax Information
The following is a general summary of the current federal income tax treatment of Incentive Awards, which are authorized to be granted under the 2019 Stock Plan, based upon the current provisions of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. The rules governing the tax treatment of such awards are technical, so the following discussion of tax consequences is necessarily general in nature and does not purport to be complete. In addition, statutory provisions are subject to change, as are their interpretations, and their application may vary in individual circumstances. Finally, this discussion does not address the tax consequences under applicable state and local law.
Incentive Stock Options. A participant will not recognize income on the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. However, the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise is an adjustment item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. If a participant does not exercise an incentive stock option within certain specified periods after termination of employment, the participant will recognize ordinary income on the exercise of an incentive stock option in the same manner as on the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, as described below.
The general rule is that gain or loss from the sale or exchange of shares acquired on the exercise of an incentive stock option will be treated as capital gain or loss. If certain holding period requirements are not satisfied, however, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income at the time of the disposition. Gain recognized on the disposition in excess of the ordinary income resulting therefrom will be capital gain, and any loss recognized will be a capital loss.
Nonqualified Stock Options, SARs, RSUs, Performance Awards, Stock Awards, and Dividend Equivalents. A participant generally is not required to recognize income on the grant of a nonqualified stock option, SARs, RSUs, a performance award, a stock award, or dividend equivalents. Instead, ordinary income generally is required to be recognized on the date the nonqualified stock option or stock appreciation right is exercised, or in the case of RSUs, performance awards, stock awards, and dividend equivalents, upon the issuance of shares and/or the payment of cash pursuant to the terms of the award. In general, the amount of ordinary income required to be recognized: (i) in the case of a nonqualified stock option, is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date over the exercise price; (ii) in the case of SARs, the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any shares received upon exercise plus the amount of taxes withheld from such amounts; and (iii) in the case of RSUs, performance awards, stock awards, and dividend equivalents, the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any shares received in respect thereof, plus the amount of taxes withheld from such amounts.
Table of Contents
Item 4: Vote to Approve the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan 
Restricted Stock. Unless a participant who receives an award of restricted stock makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code ("Section 83(b) Election") as described below, the participant generally is not required to recognize ordinary income on the award of restricted stock. Instead, on the date the shares vest (i.e., become transferable or no longer subject to forfeiture), the participant will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on such date over the amount, if any, paid for such shares. If a participant makes a Section 83(b) Election to recognize ordinary income on the date the shares are awarded, the amount of ordinary income required to be recognized is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on the date of award over the amount, if any, paid for such shares. In such case, the participant will not be required to recognize additional ordinary income when the shares vest.
Gain or Loss on Sale or Exchange of Shares. In general, gain or loss from the sale or exchange of shares granted or awarded under the 2019 Stock Plan will be treated as capital gain or loss, provided that the shares are held as capital assets at the time of the sale or exchange. However, if certain holding period requirements are not satisfied at the time of a sale or exchange of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option (a "disqualifying disposition"), a participant generally will be required to recognize ordinary income upon such disposition.
Deductibility by Company. The Company generally is not allowed a deduction in connection with the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. However, if a participant is required to recognize income as a result of a disqualifying disposition, the Company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income so recognized. In general, in the case of nonqualified stock options (including incentive stock options that are treated as nonqualified stock options, as described above), SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, performance awards, stock awards, and dividend equivalents, the Company will be allowed a deduction in an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by a participant, provided that certain income tax reporting requirements are satisfied. However, the Company may be subject to limits on tax deductibility relating to compensation described herein under certain statutory provisions, including Section 162(m) of the Code.
Parachute Payments. Where payments to certain employees that are contingent on a change in control exceed limits specified in the Code, the employee generally is liable for a 20% excise tax on, and the corporation or other entity making the payment generally is not entitled to any deduction for, a specified portion of such payments. The Compensation Committee has in the past, and may in the future, make awards as to which the vesting thereof is accelerated by a change in control of the Company. Such accelerated vesting would be relevant in determining whether the excise tax and deduction disallowance rules would be triggered with respect to certain Company employees.
Accounting Treatment
Under present accounting rules, the grant of Incentive Awards will generally result in a charge against CSX's earnings, based upon the fair market value of the Incentive Awards at the date of the grant, and the charge will generally be taken over the vesting period of the Incentive Award. However, in the case of SARs intended to be settled in cash, the excess, if any, from time to time of the fair market value of the common stock subject to SARs, over the exercise price of the SARs, will result in a charge against CSX's earnings. The amount of the charge will increase or decrease based on changes in the market value of the common stock and will decrease to the extent SARs are cancelled. CSX has not issued any SARs to date.
Registration With the SEC
If our shareholders approve the 2019 Stock Plan, we plan to file a registration statement on a Form S-8 (and/or an amendment to our existing registration statement that has been filed with respect to the 2010 Stock Plan) with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after such approval, to register the Shares available for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan.
New Plan Benefits
As described above, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, will select the participants who receive awards and the size and types of those awards under the 2019 Stock Plan, if the 2019 Stock Plan is approved by our shareholders. Therefore, the awards that will be made to particular individuals or groups of individuals in the future under the 2019 Stock Plan are not currently determinable. Additionally, a new plan benefits table for the 2019 Stock Plan and the benefits or amounts that would have been received by or allocated to participants for the last completed fiscal year under the 2019 Stock Plan if the 2019 Stock Plan was then in effect, as described in the federal proxy rules, are not provided because all awards made under the 2019 Stock Plan will be made at the Compensation Committee's discretion, subject to the terms of the 2019 Stock Plan. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that would have been received or allocated under the 2019 Stock Plan for 2018 are also not determinable at this time.

The SEC's rules permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers, banks and other nominees) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those security holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for security holders and cost savings for companies.
As in prior years, a number of brokers with account holders who are CSX shareholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. As indicated in the notice previously provided by these brokers to CSX shareholders, a single copy of the proxy materials will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected shareholder. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. Shareholders who participate in "householding" continue to receive separate proxy cards, voting instructions or notice of internet availability, as applicable, which will allow each individual to vote independently.
If you are a registered shareholder currently participating in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, or if you would like to opt out of householding for future deliveries of your annual proxy materials, please contact us at CSX Corporation, Office of the Corporate Secretary, 500 Water Street, C160, Jacksonville, Florida 32202, or by telephone at (904) 359-3256. If a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report is requested for the Annual Meeting, it will be mailed promptly following receipt of the request.
A street name shareholder who received a copy of the proxy materials at a shared address may request a separate copy of the Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report by contacting us at CSX Corporation, Office of the Corporate Secretary, 500 Water Street, C160, Jacksonville, Florida 32202, or by telephone at (904) 359-3256.
Street name shareholders sharing an address who received multiple copies of the annual proxy materials and wish to receive a single copy of these materials in the future should contact their broker, bank or other nominee to make this request.
