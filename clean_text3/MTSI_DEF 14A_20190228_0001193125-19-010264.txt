PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING PROXIES AND VOTING AT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Why did I receive these proxy materials? 
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors of MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company," "we," "us" or "our"), of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and at any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. In accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), on or about January 16, 2019, we sent a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and provided access to our proxy materials over the Internet to the holders of record and beneficial owners of our common stock as of the close of business on January 7, 2019 (the "Record Date"). 
The Annual Meeting will be held at the Radisson Hotel, located at 10 Independence Drive, Chelmsford, Massachusetts 01824, on Thursday, February 28, 2019 at 3:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). 
What information is included in this Proxy Statement? 
The information in this Proxy Statement relates to the proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, the voting process, our board of directors and board committees, the compensation of current directors and our current named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 and other information. 
Who is entitled to vote? 
Holders of our common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 65,372,185 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
How many votes do I have? 
On any matter that is submitted to a vote of our stockholders, the holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share of common stock held by them. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. 
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
Most stockholders hold their shares through a broker, trust, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own names. 
If, on the Record Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote over the Internet, by telephone or by filling out and returning a proxy card to ensure your vote is counted. 
If, on the Record Date, your shares were held in an account at a brokerage firm, trust, bank, dealer or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials   are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy or letter from your broker, trust, bank or other nominee. 
What am I voting on? 
We are asking you to vote on the following matters in connection with the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  The election of the three Class I directors nominated by our board of directors and named in the  accompanying proxy materials to serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  An advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  An advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public  accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  Such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.   
[END TABLE]
What are the Board's recommendation? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal    Board Recommendation   
 1.  Election of Directors      For all Nominees   
 2.  The approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named  executive officers;      For   
 3.  The approval, on an advisory basis, of the frequency of future advisory votes on  the compensation of our named executive officers; and       Once every three years     
 4.  Ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered  public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019.      For   
[END TABLE]
How do I vote? 
Vote by Internet. Stockholders of record may submit proxies over the Internet by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if printed copies of the proxy materials were requested, the instructions on the printed proxy card. Most beneficial stockholders may vote by accessing the website specified on the voting instruction forms provided by their brokers, trustees, banks or other nominees. Please check your voting instruction form for Internet voting availability. 
Vote by Telephone. Stockholders of record may submit proxies using any touch-tone telephone from within the United States by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if printed copies of the proxy materials were requested, the instructions on the printed proxy card. Most beneficial owners may vote using any touch-tone telephone from within the United States by calling the number specified on the voting instruction forms provided by their brokers, trustees, banks or other nominees. 
Vote by Mail. Stockholders of record may submit proxies by mail by requesting printed proxy cards and completing, signing and dating the printed proxy cards and mailing them in the pre-addressed envelopes that will accompany the printed proxy materials. Beneficial owners may vote by completing, signing and dating the voting instruction forms provided and mailing them in the pre-addressed envelopes accompanying the voting instruction forms.  If you are a stockholder of record and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy as recommended by the board of directors. If you are a beneficial owner and you return your signed voting instruction form but do not indicate your voting preferences, please see "What are 'broker non-votes' and how do they affect the proposals?" regarding whether your broker, trust, bank or other nominee may vote your uninstructed shares on a particular proposal. 
Vote in Person at the Annual Meeting. All stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date can vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You can also be represented by another person at the Annual Meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that person. If you are a beneficial owner, you must obtain a legal proxy or letter from your broker, trust, bank or other nominee and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot to be able to vote at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also vote either by telephone, by Internet or by mail so that your vote will be counted if you decide not to attend. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of materials? 
If you receive more than one set of materials, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. In order to vote all of the shares you own, you must either sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedures on each of the proxy cards or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials you receive. 
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting by (a) delivering written notice, bearing a date later than the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked to MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851, Attn: General Counsel, (b) submitting a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares by mail, telephone or the Internet prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting or (c) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Stockholders of record may send a request for a new proxy card via e-mail to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or follow the instructions provided on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy card to submit a new proxy by telephone or via the Internet. Stockholders of record may also request a new proxy card by calling 1-800-579-1639. 
If you are a beneficial stockholder, you may revoke your proxy or change your vote only by following the separate instructions provided by your broker, trust, bank or other nominee. 
What constitutes a quorum at the Annual Meeting? 
Transaction of business at the Annual Meeting may occur only if a quorum is present. If a quorum is not present, it is expected that the Annual Meeting will be adjourned or postponed in order to permit additional time for soliciting and obtaining additional proxies or votes, and, at any subsequent reconvening of the Annual Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Annual Meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn. 
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total votes entitled to be cast constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. 
What are the voting requirements to elect directors and approve each of the other proposals described in this Proxy Statement? 
With respect to Proposal 1, the election of directors, each of the three Class I director nominees receiving the largest number of votes will be elected. With respect to Proposals 2 and 4, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter is required for the proposal to be approved. With respect to Proposal 3, the frequency   of future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation, we will consider the alternative receiving the greatest number of votes – one, two or three years – to be the frequency that stockholders approve. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes in favor of or against any proposal. 
What are "broker non-votes" and how do they affect the proposals? 
A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote the shares on a proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power for a particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner regarding voting. Brokers who hold shares for the accounts of their clients have discretionary authority to vote shares if specific instructions are not given with respect to routine matters. The proposal on ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is a routine matter and the other proposals are non-routine matters. If your shares are held by a broker on your behalf and you do not instruct the broker as to how to vote your shares, your broker will be entitled to exercise discretion to vote your shares on the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, but your broker may not exercise discretion to vote on the other proposals. Broker non-votes are not counted as votes in favor of or against any proposal. 
What are the requirements for admission to the Annual Meeting? 
Only stockholders of record and persons holding proxies from stockholders of record may attend the Annual Meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you must bring a valid form of photo identification, such as a valid driver's license or passport, to the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, trust, bank or other nominee, you must bring a legal proxy or letter from that broker, trust, bank or other nominee that confirms you are the beneficial owner of those shares and a valid form of photo identification. Attendance at the Annual Meeting without voting or revoking a previously submitted proxy in accordance with the voting procedures will not in and of itself revoke a proxy. 
Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
We will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, our directors, officers and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, letter, facsimile, email, in person or otherwise. Following the original circulation of the proxies and other soliciting materials, we will request brokers, trusts, banks or other nominees to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold shares of our common stock and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, we, upon the request of the brokers, trusts, banks and other nominees, will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses. 
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
We have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to stockholders of record as of the Record Date. Stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or to request to receive an electronic copy or printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request an electronic copy or printed copy may be found in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. 
When will we announce the results of the voting? 
Voting results will be announced by the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are unavailable at that time, we will file an amended Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the day the final results become available.

Directors Not Standing for Election at the Annual Meeting 
John Ocampo, age 59, is a Class III director who has served as a director and as the Chairman of the board of directors since our inception in March 2009.

His engineering background and extensive knowledge of our operations, markets and technology provides our board of directors with important insights. We also believe that having our largest stockholder (together with Mrs. Ocampo and their affiliates) on the board of directors assists the board in making decisions aimed at increasing stockholder value over the long term.

Mr. Bland's qualifications to serve as a director include his detailed knowledge of our business, operations, senior leadership, and strategic opportunities and challenges based on his prior service as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, Mr. Bland's extensive experience in a variety of executive roles at public companies in our industry, his executive experience in other industries, and his prior experience as a public company director and audit committee chair allow him to bring a broad and diverse perspective to our board of directors. His prior Chief Financial Officer and audit committee experience have provided him expertise with accounting principles and financial reporting rules and regulations, in evaluating financial results and in generally overseeing the financial reporting process. 
John Croteau, age 57, is a Class III director who has served as our Chief Executive Officer and as a director since December 2012, and as our President since October 2012.

("NXP"), a provider of mixed signal solutions and standard products, where he served as the Senior Vice President and General Manager of its High-Performance RF business from May 2008 to October 2012. For three of those years, Mr. Croteau also managed NXP's Power & Lighting Solutions business. Prior to joining NXP, Mr. Croteau held numerous product management positions at Analog Devices, Inc. ("ADI"), a high-performance semiconductor company, including General Manager for ADI's Convergent Platforms and Services Group as well as product line director for the Integrated Audio Group. Mr. Croteau holds a B.S. in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Penn State University. Mr. Croteau's qualifications to serve as a director include his unique perspective and insights into our operations as our current President and Chief Executive Officer, including his knowledge of our products, technologies, business relationships, competitive and financial positioning, senior leadership and strategic opportunities and challenges. Our board of directors also benefits from Mr. Croteau's industry perspective, stemming from his broad experience in a variety of executive roles at public semiconductor companies. 
Stephen G. Daly, age 53, is a Class II director who has served as a director since March 2015. From January 2004 through March 2013, Mr. Daly served as the President of Hittite Microwave Corporation ("Hittite"), a provider of analog and mixed signal integrated circuits, modules and subsystems for commercial and military RF, microwave and millimeterwave applications. Mr. Daly also served as Hittite's Chief Executive Officer from December 2004 through March 2013. He served as a member of Hittite's board of directors from January 2004 through May 2013, and as its chairman from December 2005 through March 2013. From 1996 to 2004 he was employed in other application engineering, marketing and sales roles at Hittite. Mr. Daly also serves as a director of a privately-held company. Mr. Daly received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University. Mr. Daly's depth and breadth of expertise in the analog and mixed signal semiconductor industry and prior experience serving on the board of directors of a public company in our industry contributes valuable perspective and insight to our board of directors. 
Susan Ocampo, age 60, is a Class II director who has served as a director since June 2016, and previously served as a director from December 2010 to February 2016. She has also served as Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer of GaAs Labs, since co-founding it in February 2008. Previously, Mrs. Ocampo co-founded Sirenza in 1984. Mrs. Ocampo served as Sirenza's Treasurer from November 1999 through its sale to RFMD in November 2007. Mrs. Ocampo holds a B.A. from Maryknoll College. Mrs. Ocampo's extensive experience investing and serving in financial leadership roles with semiconductor companies strengthens our board of director's oversight of our enterprise risk management, treasury functions and internal financial controls. We also believe that having our largest stockholder (together with Mr. Ocampo and their affiliates) on the board of directors assists the board in making decisions aimed at increasing stockholder value over the long term. 
There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers, other than Mr. Ocampo, the Chairman of the board of directors, and Mrs. Ocampo, a director, who are married to each other.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board of Directors 
Our board of directors and its committees meet throughout the year on a set schedule, and also hold special meetings and act by written or electronic consent from time to time. During fiscal year 2018, including telephonic meetings, our board of directors held seven meetings, the audit committee held eight meetings, the compensation committee held five meetings and the nominating and governance committee held one meeting. From time to time during fiscal year 2018, our directors who are "independent" according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") also met separately in executive sessions at which only independent directors were present. 
During fiscal year 2018, each member of the board of directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and committees on which he or she served. We encourage, but do not require, our directors and nominees for director to attend our annual meeting of stockholders in person or telephonically. Four of our directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in March 2018. 
Director Independence 
Our board of directors has reviewed its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each member of our board of directors during fiscal year 2018. Based on information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliates, our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Bland, Chung, Daly, Ribar and Van Lunsen qualify as "independent" according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing requirements and rules. As of January 16, 2019, Messrs. Ocampo and Croteau are not independent according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq because they are our employees, and Mrs. Ocampo is not independent because she is the spouse of one of our executive officers. 
The listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq require that, subject to certain exemptions, the board of directors of a listed company be comprised of a majority of independent directors, that the compensation, nominating and governance and audit committees of such listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, that the compensation committee be comprised of at least two independent directors, and that the audit committee be comprised of at least three independent directors. As of January 16, 2019, the composition of our board of directors and its committees satisfied all such requirements. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our board of directors does not currently have a policy as to whether the offices of Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer should be separate. Our board of directors believes that it should have the flexibility to make this determination as circumstances require and in a manner that it believes is best to provide appropriate leadership for our Company. The board of directors believes that its current leadership structure, with Mr. Ocampo serving as Chairman of the board of directors and Mr. Croteau serving as Chief Executive Officer, is appropriate because it enables the board of directors as a whole to engage in oversight of management, promote communication between management and the board of directors and oversee governance matters and risk management activities, while allowing our Chief Executive Officer to focus on his primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company. In addition, the board of directors benefits from the perspective and insights of Messrs. Ocampo and Croteau as a result of their extensive experience in the semiconductor industry. 
Risk Oversight 
The board of directors oversees our risk management activities. The board of directors implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through delegation to its committees. These committees meet regularly   and report back to the full board of directors. The audit committee has primary oversight responsibility with respect to financial risks as well as oversight responsibility for our overall risk assessment and risk management policies and systems. The audit committee oversees our procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints relating to accounting and auditing matters and oversees our management of legal and regulatory compliance systems. The compensation committee oversees risks relating to our compensation plans and programs, including the evaluation of whether our compensation programs contain incentives for executive officers and employees to take risks in performing their duties that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The compensation committee believes that we have no compensation policies and programs that give rise to risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The nominating and governance committee oversees risks associated with corporate governance and the composition of our board of directors, including the independence of board members. Each committee reports on its activities to the full board of directors from time to time. This enables the board of directors and its committees to coordinate their respective risk oversight roles. 
Board Committees 
The board of directors currently has the following standing committees: audit, compensation and nominating and governance. The board of directors has adopted a written charter for each standing committee, each of which may be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.macom.com/governance-documents. A summary of the duties and responsibilities of each committee is set forth below. 
Audit Committee 
Our audit committee consists of Messrs. Bland, Daly, Ribar and Van Lunsen, with Mr. Ribar serving as Chair. Our audit committee oversees our corporate accounting and financial reporting process, internal accounting and financial controls and audits of our financial statements. Our audit committee also evaluates the independent auditor's qualifications, independence and performance; engages and provides for the compensation of the independent auditor; establishes the policies and procedures for the retention of the independent auditor to perform any proposed permissible non-audit services; reviews our annual audited financial statements; reviews our critical accounting policies, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; discusses with management and the independent auditor the results of the annual audit and the reviews of our quarterly unaudited financial statements; oversees our financial risk assessment and management programs; reviews our information security and technology risks (including cybersecurity), including our information security and risk management programs; and reviews related person transactions that are required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Our board of directors has determined that each of our audit committee members meets the requirements for independence and financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq. Our board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Ribar and Van Lunsen is an audit committee financial expert as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. 
Compensation Committee 
Our compensation committee consists of Messrs. Chung, Daly and Van Lunsen, with Mr. Chung serving as Chair. Our compensation committee oversees our compensation plans, policies and programs for our executive officers and our board of directors. The compensation committee is also responsible for overseeing our equity compensation and other employee benefit plans, and for reviewing our Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The compensation committee also oversees our submissions to stockholders on executive compensation matters, including stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and the frequency of such votes, incentive and other executive compensation plans and amendments to such plans and engagement with proxy advisory firms and other stockholder groups on executive compensation matters. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our compensation committee meets the requirements for independence under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, Nasdaq and Section 162(m) of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), to the extent applicable. Pursuant to its charter, the compensation committee may form and delegate   authority to subcommittees and delegate authority to one or more designated members of the committee. The compensation committee may also delegate to one or more senior executive officers the authority to make grants of equity-based compensation to eligible non-officer employees, subject to compliance with applicable laws. For additional discussion of the processes and procedures the compensation committee has used to determine executive officer compensation please refer to the section entitled, "Named Executive Officer Compensation, Compensation Discussion and Analysis – How We Set Executive Compensation." 
During fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee engaged Radford Consulting ("Radford"), a compensation consultant, and reviewed certain survey data and analyses regarding executive and non-employee director compensation compiled by Radford in connection with setting executive compensation. Please see "Director Compensation" and "Named Executive Officer Compensation, Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for further description of the services and data provided by Radford. Prior to continuing Radford's engagement, the compensation committee considered the independence of Radford in accordance with the terms of its charter. The committee determined that Radford was independent and did not identify any conflicts of interest with respect to Radford. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
Our nominating and governance committee consists of Messrs. Bland, Chung and Van Lunsen, with Mr. Bland serving as Chair. The nominating and governance committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become members of our board of directors, receiving and reviewing nominations for such qualified individuals, making recommendations regarding candidates to serve on our board of directors and overseeing evaluations of the board of directors and its committees. In making recommendations regarding board candidates, the nominating and governance committee will consider desired board member qualifications, expertise, diversity and characteristics. In addition, the nominating and governance committee is responsible for making recommendations concerning governance matters. The nominating and governance committee is also responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the structure and function of the committees of our board of directors, after consultation with the applicable committee chairs, and for reviewing any stockholder proposals relating to governance matters and our response to such proposals. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our nominating and governance committee meets the requirements for independence under the applicable Nasdaq listing rules. 
Pursuant to its charter, the nominating and governance committee will also consider qualified director candidates recommended by our stockholders. The nominating and governance committee evaluates the qualifications of candidates properly submitted by stockholders in the same manner as it evaluates the qualifications of director candidates identified by the committee or the board of directors. Stockholders can recommend director candidates by following the instructions outlined below in the section entitled "Additional Information – Consideration of Stockholder-Recommended Director Nominees." No nominations for director were submitted to the nominating and governance committee for consideration by any of our stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting. 
The nominating and governance committee may rely on recommendations from a number of sources when identifying potential director candidates, including recommendations from current directors and officers. The committee may hire outside consultants, search firms or other advisors to assist in identifying director candidates. 
When evaluating a candidate for director, the nominating and governance committee considers, among other things, the candidate's judgment, knowledge, integrity, diversity, expertise and strategic, business and industry experience, which are likely to enhance the board of directors' ability to govern our affairs and business. We do not have a separate policy regarding consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, but the nominating and governance committee strives to nominate directors with a variety of complementary skills and backgrounds so that, as a group, the board of directors will possess a broad perspective and the appropriate talent, skills and expertise to oversee our business. The nominating and governance committee also takes into account independence requirements imposed by law or regulations (including the Nasdaq listing standards). In the case of   director candidates recommended by stockholders, the nominating and governance committee may also consider the number of shares held by the recommending stockholder, the length of time that such shares have been held and the relationship, if any, between the recommending stockholder and the recommended director nominee.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• a $45,000 annual cash retainer for each non-employee director;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 for each member of the audit committee, $7,500 for each member of  the compensation committee and $5,000 for each member of the nominating and governance committee, in each case, other than the chair of such committee; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
• an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000 for the chair of the audit committee, $15,000 for the chair of the  compensation committee and $10,000 for the chair of the nominating and governance committee.  
[END TABLE]
These cash payments are calculated and paid in quarterly installments and are prorated for partial quarters of board or committee service. Non-employee directors are also reimbursed for expenses in connection with attendance at board of directors and committee meetings. Non-employee directors are also eligible for coverage under our health care plans at their election and at their sole expense.  Equity Compensation. Non-employee directors are eligible to receive equity-based awards under the MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, our "2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan"). The equity component of our non-employee director compensation program is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of our non-employee directors is granted an annual restricted stock  unit award (or, upon the director's request, a restricted stock award) on the first business day following the date of our annual meeting of stockholders representing a number of shares of common stock having a grant date fair market value of  approximately $130,000. This award vests in full on February 15 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of its grant, subject to the non-employee director's continued service  through such date and the terms of our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan. If a non-employee director first joins the board of directors after the annual grant for the calendar year of his or her appointment or election has been made, then he or she is  granted an annual restricted stock unit award (or, upon the director's request, a restricted stock award) on the first business day following his or her appointment or election representing a number of shares of our common stock having an  aggregate grant date fair market value equal to $130,000 pro-rated based on the number of calendar days remaining in the calendar year following such appointment or election. This award vests in full on the  first February 15 following its grant date, subject to the non-employee director's continued service through such date and the terms of our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In addition to and not in lieu of the annual grant described above, when a  non-employee director first joins the board of directors, he or she is granted a one-time initial restricted stock unit award (or, upon the director's request, a  restricted stock award) on the first business day following his or her appointment or election representing a number of shares of our common stock having an aggregate grant date fair market value of approximately $170,000. This award vests in three  equal annual installments, with the first such vesting date being one year following whichever of February 15, May 15, August 15 or November 15 is soonest to follow the non-employee  director's date of appointment or election, in all cases subject to the non-employee director's continued service through such date and the terms of our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Such initial  grants are not prorated.  
[END TABLE]
In accordance with our non-employee director compensation program, on March 2, 2018 we granted each of Messrs. Bland, Chung, Daly, Ribar and Van Lunsen an annual restricted stock unit award representing 6,086 shares of our common stock for their service as directors during fiscal year 2018, which will vest in full on February 15, 2019, subject to such non-employee director's continued service through such date and the terms of our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides that the initial and annual non-employee director equity awards described above are granted automatically without the need for further action by our board of directors or the compensation committee, except that non-employee directors who beneficially own more than 25% of our common stock are not eligible to receive such automatic grants.

Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Programs 
The compensation committee of our board of directors oversees the compensation programs covering our executive officers, including our named executive officers, under its authority as delegated by our board of directors. These compensation programs are designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain the best executive talent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• motivate our executives to achieve our financial and business goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders to drive increased stockholder value.   
[END TABLE]
To achieve these goals, we structure our executive compensation programs to provide a competitive level of total compensation and create a strong link with our financial and business results by tying a significant portion of each executive's compensation to the achievement of specific performance goals that we expect will increase stockholder value. 
How We Set Executive Compensation 
The compensation in effect for our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 reflects a combination of individually negotiated compensation arrangements that we have entered into with certain of our named executive officers, as described below, and a total compensation program for our executive officers developed in prior periods by our compensation committee and further refined by it in fiscal year 2018 as described in more detail below. Our compensation committee annually reviews and periodically adjusts the total compensation payable to our named executive officers based on the information and factors discussed below and recommendations made by our Chief Executive Officer from time to time (other than with respect to his own compensation). 
During fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee used industry total compensation data compiled by Radford, our compensation consultant, and proxy statement data as a reference in evaluating and refining our executive compensation programs. More specifically, during fiscal year 2018 our compensation committee reviewed compensation data compiled by Radford from companies with $200 million to $2.0 billion in annual revenue, which we believe are comparable to us in size, and proxy statement data gathered from the following companies that we considered similar to us in terms of business lines or in terms of potential competition for executive talent: Analogic Corporation, Cabot Microelectronics Corporation, Cavium, Inc., Cirrus Logic Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Diodes Incorporated, Entegris, Inc., Inphi Corporation, Integrated Device Technology, Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, MaxLinear, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, MKS Instruments, Inc., Power Integrations Inc., Rambus Inc., Semtech Corporation, Silicon Laboratories Inc., Teradyne Inc. and Xperi Corporation.  Using such industry total compensation and proxy statement data and subjective factors, such as the relative importance we place on each role within the Company, considerations of peer group equity compensation practices, internal pay equity and other factors, the compensation committee in fiscal year 2015 developed total compensation "targets" for each of our executive officer positions. The compensation committee then developed a total compensation program, primarily consisting of base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives, as discussed in further detail below, designed to provide each executive officer with the opportunity to realize targeted total compensation while furthering the objectives of our executive compensation programs described above. Based in part on the results of our most recent "say-on-pay" vote in 2016, in which our stockholders overwhelmingly approved our executive compensation programs, our executive compensation programs have generally been carried forward through fiscal year 2018 but refined from time to time based on the compensation committee's review of the industry total compensation, proxy statement data and subjective factors described above, with adjustments as noted in "Elements of Compensation" below. We did not specifically benchmark the total compensation or individual components of compensation for our named executive officers in fiscal year 2018, other than for our Chief Financial Officer as described below. Based on our review of the 2015 data described above, and the Chief Financial Officer data described below, we believe that the total compensation provided to our named executive officers in fiscal year 2018 was generally below market median to market median overall assuming a "target" level of achievement against the performance targets applicable to the short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives granted to such named executive officers in fiscal year 2018 (discussed in more detail below), and market median to above market median overall assuming a "maximum" level of achievement against such performance targets. 
Elements of Executive Compensation 
Our compensation programs for our named executive officers primarily consist of the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary and benefits;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• short-term cash incentives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term equity incentives.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salary and Benefits 
Base Salary. The base salary for each of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 was determined by our compensation committee and is intended to reflect each executive's relative level of experience and responsibility. In fiscal year 2018, the compensation committee authorized a 3% increase to the base salary of our Chief Executive Officer, a 15% increase to the base salary of our Chief Financial Officer, and a 3% increase to the base salary of each of our other named executive officers, in each case, effective in April 2018. In determining these base salary increases, our compensation committee considered the industry total compensation and proxy statement data discussed above and, for our Chief Financial Officer, considered the market data report prepared by Radford comparing his compensation to chief financial officers within our peer group. Based on such considerations, our compensation committee determined that such base salary increases were appropriate to maintain competitive levels of base salary for each of these individuals.  The following table shows the annual base salaries for our named executive officers in place at the end of fiscal year 2018.

Benefits. We generally provide our named executive officers health and welfare benefits, including health benefits and life insurance coverage, as well as the opportunity to participate in and receive matching contributions under our 401(k) plan, in each case, on the same terms as our other salaried employees. 
We believe that, in order for us to attract top executive talent, we must not be limited to those individuals residing in the Boston metropolitan area and, in some cases, must be willing to offer to pay for or reimburse an agreed upon amount of relocation, commuting, housing and other related costs. In fiscal year 2018, we made such payments and reimbursements to our Chief Financial Officer in connection with his commuting to work from a home outside the Boston metropolitan area, in the amounts set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Short-Term Cash Incentives 
During fiscal year 2018, each of our named executive officers participated in our cash incentive programs. Our cash incentive programs were comprised of two six-month performance periods within our fiscal year, with performance goals for each based on non-GAAP adjusted operating income during the period but with different threshold, target and maximum performance goals for each period, as described below. We selected adjusted operating income as the performance metric for these programs because we believe it is a driver of stockholder value. The calculation of adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accrued costs for the payment of incentives under the cash incentive program itself, as well as the effect, where applicable, of intangible amortization expense, share-based compensation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, financing and litigation costs, acquisition- and integration-related costs, equity investment gains and losses, divested business losses, production and product line exit costs and other costs and includes certain deferred revenue amounts. 
Our compensation committee determined the adjusted operating income goals for each performance period based on our historic adjusted operating income, our annual business plan and sequential revenue projections. These goals were intended to be challenging, yet obtainable, and align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders by providing for a payout only in the event of exceptional performance that it believed would result in a meaningful increase in stockholder value. 
Our compensation committee determined the target and maximum cash incentive opportunities for each of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 based on its business judgment regarding the appropriate level of incentive opportunities to motivate and retain these executives, and to establish an appropriate "pay for performance" linkage between their total compensation and our overall financial results. In making this business judgment, the compensation committee considered each named executive officer's historical level of incentive opportunities, each named executive officer's respective base salary and level of incentive opportunities relative to those of our other named executive officers, the industry total compensation and proxy statement data   discussed above and, for our Chief Financial Officer, the market data report prepared by Radford described above. Based on these considerations, our compensation committee maintained the cash incentive opportunities (as a percentage of base salary) for all of our named executive officers other than our Chief Financial Officer at their previously-set levels and increased the target short-term cash incentive opportunity for our Chief Financial Officer from 50% to 75% of his base salary, effective beginning in April 2018, which our compensation committee determined was appropriate to maintain a competitive level of short-term incentive compensation opportunity for him. This incentive opportunity was also subject to potential discretionary increase or reduction based on individual performance during the period. The following table shows the cash incentive opportunity of each of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 assuming "target" level achievement against applicable performance metrics, expressed as a percentage of each executive's annual base salary.

[END TABLE]
First Half 2018 Program. Payments under the cash incentive program for the first half of fiscal year 2018 were based on our performance in that period as compared against the following adjusted operating income goals for the six months ended March 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 First Half Fiscal Year 2018 Performance Goal           Threshold                   Target                   Maximum             Actual       Performance         
 Adjusted Operating Income    $90.8 million    $99.9 million    $113.4 million    $28.1 million 
[END TABLE]
Under the first half program, if performance exceeded the threshold level, a total pool for all participating employees within the Company would be funded at $6.7 million for target performance and at $13.4 million for maximum performance. For performance falling between the threshold and target levels, the total pool would be funded at a rate of $0.736 per $1.00 of adjusted operating income achieved in excess of the threshold level, and for performance falling between the target and maximum levels, a total pool would be funded at a rate of $0.496 per $1.00 of adjusted operating income achieved in excess of the target level, up to the maximum level. Each named executive officer would be eligible for a payment based on an allocated portion of this pool based on the executive's target incentive amount, with discretionary adjustments based on individual performance. There was no set weighting assigned by the compensation committee with respect to the individual performance component of the cash incentive program. 
In light of our performance for the first half of fiscal year 2018 (see the "Actual Performance" column in the table above), no named executive officer received a cash incentive payment for the first half of fiscal year 2018. 
Second Half 2018 Program. Payments under the cash incentive program for the second half of fiscal year 2018 were based on our performance in that period as compared against the following adjusted operating income goals for the six months ended September 28, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Second Half Fiscal Year 2018 Performance Goal           Threshold                   Target                   Maximum             Actual       Performance         
 Second Half Fiscal Year 2018 Performance Goal           Threshold                   Target                   Maximum             Actual       Performance         
[END TABLE]
Under the second half program, if performance exceeded the threshold level, a total pool for all participating employees within the Company would be funded at $6.9 million for target performance and $13.8 million for maximum performance. For performance falling between the threshold and target levels, the total pool would be funded at a rate of $2.029 per $1.00 of adjusted operating income achieved in excess of the threshold level, and for performance falling between the target and maximum levels, the total pool would be funded at a rate of $0.645 per $1.00 of adjusted operating income achieved in excess of the target level, up to the maximum level. Each named executive officer would be eligible for a payment based on an allocated portion of this pool based on the executive's target incentive amount, with discretionary adjustments based on individual performance. There was no set weighting assigned by the compensation committee with respect to the individual performance component of the cash incentive program. 
In light of our performance for the second half of fiscal year 2018 (see the "Actual Performance" column in the table above), no named executive officer received a cash incentive payment for the second half of fiscal year 2018. 
Long-Term Equity Incentives 
Our long-term equity incentive program is comprised of two components: time-based equity incentives, which are provided in the form of restricted stock units and stock options, and performance-based equity incentives, which are provided in the form of performance-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock options. In fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee granted our Chief Executive Officer performance-based restricted stock units and time- and performance-based stock options and granted our other named executive officers time- and performance-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock options. The size of each award was determined by the compensation committee based on its consideration of the industry total compensation and proxy statement data described above. Prior to fiscal year 2018, our Chief Executive Officer received a mixture of time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance-based options. Our compensation committee determined that, consistent with our "pay for performance" philosophy, it was advisable to subject all stock option awards granted to our named executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, and a portion of the restricted stock unit awards granted to our named executive officers, in fiscal year 2018 to vesting based on the achievement of performance metrics the committee believed would increase stockholder value. For fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee chose to grant our Chief Executive Officer only performance-based restricted stock units, in addition to time- and performance-based stock options because it believed that providing 100% of his long-term equity incentives for fiscal year 2018 in the form of performance- and appreciation-based awards, which will have value only if our stock price appreciates, in the case of the stock options, or we achieve key performance goals, in the case of the performance-based restricted stock units, would further align his interests with the interests of our stockholders. 
Time-Based Equity Incentives. 
In fiscal year 2018, we provided each of our named executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer, with long-term equity incentives through the grant of restricted stock units subject to time-based vesting under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Our compensation committee granted restricted stock units because they believe they provide a valuable retention incentive to our executives. In addition, our compensation committee believes that because restricted stock units require fewer shares to deliver the same amount of retention incentive to a given executive than a stock option award, restricted stock units also reduce the overall potential dilution to our stockholders from our equity compensation programs. 
In fiscal year 2018, as part of our annual equity compensation program, we granted our Chief Financial Officer 5,919 restricted stock units, our Senior Vice President, Operations, 3,894 restricted stock units, our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Lightwave, 4,097 restricted stock units and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Networks 3,944 restricted stock units, in each case, subject to time-based vesting based on their continued employment with us over four years. Our compensation committee approved these restricted stock unit awards based on its business judgment that they reflected an appropriate level of long-term incentive necessary to retain these executives.  In addition, during fiscal year 2018 we granted our Chief Executive Officer an additional 80,000 time-based stock options that vest based on his continued employment over four years and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Lightwave, an additional 40,435 retention restricted stock units and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Networks, an additional 35,000 restricted stock units that vest based on each of their continued employment over five years as a further long-term retention incentive to each of them. Our compensation committee approved these additional awards based on its business judgment that a further retention incentive for each executive was necessary to retain such executive because of the importance of each such executive to our business and approved the additional restricted stock unit awards to our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Lightwave, and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Networks, because of the recent shift in our business mix toward the optical and photonic markets and our growth aspirations in those markets, and their significant knowledge, responsibilities and capabilities in these areas. 
Performance-Based Equity Incentives. 
Performance Restricted Stock Units. In addition to the time-based restricted stock unit awards described above, in fiscal year 2018, as part of our annual equity compensation program, we granted our Chief Executive Officer 35,000 restricted stock units, our Chief Financial Officer 8,878 restricted stock units, our Senior Vice President, Operations, 5,840 restricted stock units, our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Lightwave, 4,096 restricted stock units and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Networks, 5,914 restricted stock units, in each case, subject to performance-based vesting conditions. As was the case in prior years, the performance-based restricted stock units are eligible to be earned and vest based on our non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share ("Adjusted EPS") growth during the applicable performance period. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial metric and the calculation of Adjusted EPS excludes discontinued operations, intangible amortization expense, share-based compensation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, changes in common stock warrant liability, financing and litigation costs, acquisition and integration related costs, equity investment gains and losses, divested business losses, production and product line exit costs and other costs, and includes certain deferred revenue amounts as well as certain tax items. Adjusted EPS growth was selected as the applicable performance metric for performance-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal year 2018 and prior fiscal years because our compensation committee believes that growth in Adjusted EPS is a key driver of increases in stockholder value. 
The performance-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal year 2018 are divided into three equal tranches, with one tranche eligible to be earned and to vest based on our Adjusted EPS growth during fiscal year 2018, one tranche eligible to be earned and to vest based on Adjusted EPS growth during fiscal years 2018-2019 and one tranche eligible to be earned and to vest based on Adjusted EPS growth during fiscal years 2018-2020, with Adjusted EPS growth goals for performance periods spanning multiple fiscal years based on compound annual growth. For each tranche, recipients can earn between 0% to 300% of the target number of performance-based restricted stock units, depending on actual performance, with 50% of the target number of performance-based restricted stock units earned if threshold performance is achieved (Adjusted EPS growth of 5%), 100% of the target number of performance-based restricted stock units earned if threshold performance is achieved (Adjusted EPS growth of 10%), and 300% of the target number of performance-based restricted stock units earned if maximum performance is achieved (Adjusted EPS growth of 30%) and with straight-line interpolation between performance levels. To the extent earned, the performance-based restricted stock units will be settled in the following May, generally subject to continued employment with us through the settlement date. 
Each of our named executive officers also held performance-based restricted stock units that were granted in prior fiscal years and that were eligible to vest based on Adjusted EPS growth during a performance period that included fiscal year 2018. 
The Adjusted EPS growth goals for performance-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal year 2018 and granted in previous years with a performance period that included fiscal year 2018, our actual Adjusted EPS   growth for the applicable performance period and the percentage of performance-based restricted stock units that were earned based on such performance, are set forth in the table below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018    2018    5%    10%    30%    (77.6)%    —% 
 2017    2017-2018    5%    10%    30%    (47.8)%    —% 
 2016    2016-2018    5%    10%    30%    (29.5)%    —% 
[END TABLE]
Performance Stock Options. In addition to the time- and performance-based restricted stock units described above, in fiscal year 2018, as part of our annual equity compensation program, we granted our Chief Executive Officer 110,000 stock options, our Chief Financial Officer 40,000 stock options, our Senior Vice President, Operations, 30,000 stock options, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Lightwave, 30,000 stock options, and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Networks, 30,000 stock options, in each case, subject to performance-based vesting conditions. These stock options vest as to 100% of the underlying shares if the closing price for our common stock equals or exceeds $66.96 per share for a period of thirty consecutive trading days (which represented an approximate premium of 50% over the 52-week high price per share of our common stock as of the date the stock options were granted), generally subject to the executive remaining employed by us through the date such performance metric is met. Our compensation committee approved these performance-based stock options based on its business judgment that they reflected an appropriate level of long-term incentive to retain these executives and further align their compensation with the attainment of increases in stockholder value. The size of each award was determined by our compensation committee based on consideration of the factors described above. 
In November 2018, our compensation committee evaluated the outstanding performance-based stock options held by each of our named executive officers in connection with its approval of fiscal year 2019 annual equity awards and determined that certain performance-based stock options did not provide adequate retention incentives to our named executive officers because the exercise prices of such options were far in excess of the value of our common stock at that time. As a result, in November 2018, as permitted under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan, our compensation committee approved the cancellation of certain vested and unvested performance-based stock options held by our named executive officers with a per share exercise price of $29.80 or above in exchange for an award of performance-based restricted stock units. The performance-based restricted stock units will be eligible to vest based on the achievement of performance-based vesting conditions related to Adjusted EPS growth during the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, generally subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with us through the date such vesting conditions are achieved. Our compensation committee believes that these performance-based restricted stock units will better align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders, will incentivize them to achieve performance goals that we believe are important to our business and will more effectively encourage retention. 
Severance Arrangements 
We believe it is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders to encourage and reinforce the continued dedication and attention of our senior executives, and to minimize the potential for them to be distracted from performing their duties by the potential prospect of a termination of employment. Therefore, we have agreed to provide our Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Networks, with severance benefits as described in each executive's employment agreement, as described below. In October 2014, following a period of heavy consolidation in our industry and with a similar motivation of keeping our executives focused on managing our business without distraction by a potential change in control, we also adopted the MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. Change in Control Plan (as amended, the "CIC Plan"), which was subsequently amended in 2017, in which each of our named executive officers   participates and which provides severance protection to plan participants in the event their employment is terminated under certain circumstances in connection with a change in control. In adopting and subsequently amending the CIC Plan, our compensation committee was motivated by a belief that the benefits of the plan were reasonable in scope and amount, would better align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders in the context of a potential change in control and may enhance stockholder value whether or not a future change in control occurs by helping to retain those executives who are participants in this plan. See "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" below for a more detailed discussion of these potential payments. 
Non-Competition Agreements 
With the goal of securing the services of executives who may be key to our success for a period of time and preventing competitors from hiring such personnel away from us, from time to time we may enter into agreements where an executive agrees not to go to work for a competing enterprise for a period of time in exchange for a payment or payments from us. Mr. Croteau's employment agreement provides for him to have certain non-solicitation and non-competition obligations to us in exchange for salary continuance payments for twelve months following termination of his employment. 
Clawback Policy 
In November 2018, we adopted a clawback policy that covers our current and former employees at the level of Vice President and above, including all of our named executive officers. Under the policy, if there is a restatement of our financial results due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, certain cash- and equity-based incentive compensation paid or awarded to covered employees will be subject to cancellation and/or repayment, in our compensation committee's discretion, if it was based on the erroneous financial results, was in excess of the amount that would have otherwise been paid or awarded and the employee's conduct was a material factor in the obligation to restate the results. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)") generally disallows a tax deduction to a public corporation for annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain of its current and former executive officers. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, compensation that qualified as "performance-based" was excluded for purposes of calculating the amount of compensation subject to the $1 million limit. The 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation repealed the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m) and made certain other changes to Section 162(m), generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2019, compensation paid to certain of our current and former executive officers in excess of $1 million in a taxable year generally will not be deductible unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief applicable to legally-binding contracts that were in effect on November 2, 2017. The compensation committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that attracts, retains and rewards the executives necessary for our success. Accordingly, and in furtherance of that responsibility, the compensation committee has authorized and will, in its judgment, continue to authorize compensation that may otherwise be limited as to tax deductibility. 
The compensation committee also considers the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, including decisions that relate to our equity incentive plans and programs. If accounting standards change, we may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.  Say on Pay 
At our 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved on an advisory basis to hold future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers every three years. At our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers by 97.72% of the shares voted. In light of these results, our current policy is to provide stockholders with an opportunity to vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every three years. Assuming that, in connection with our say-on-frequency vote in Proposal 3, our stockholders vote for a once every three years frequency of future votes on executive compensation, our next such vote would not occur until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management, and, based on such review and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to our board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

  (1)  The amounts included under the "Stock Awards" and "Option Awards" columns reflect the  aggregate grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit and stock option awards granted in each respective fiscal year, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. For more information on the  underlying valuation assumptions used to calculate grant date fair values, see Notes 2 and 18 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  September 28, 2018. With respect to the performance-based restricted stock unit and stock option awards granted to our named executive officers during fiscal year 2018, the aggregate grant date fair value of such awards was determined based on  the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with such awards, which was determined to be 100% of target levels. The aggregate grant date fair value of such awards would be $5,555,650, $1,593,739, $1,105,531, $914,249 and $1,113,648  for Messrs. Croteau, McMullan, Dennehy, Rajgarhia and Virk, respectively, if maximum performance levels were achieved.

Pension Benefits 
We currently do not (and did not in fiscal year 2018) sponsor any defined benefit pension or other actuarial plan in which our named executive officers participate. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
We currently do not (and did not in fiscal year 2018) maintain any nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plan or arrangement for our named executive officers. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Mr. Croteau is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides for payments upon an involuntary termination of employment by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in his employment agreement) and upon a termination of employment by him for "good reason" (as defined in his employment agreement). Pursuant to Mr. Croteau's employment agreement, if his employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause or if he resigns for good reason, he would be entitled to receive continued monthly base salary and reimbursements of the Company's portion of medical and dental benefit premiums (subject to certain conditions) for twelve months following termination, a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination, based on actual performance, and twelve months' accelerated vesting credit for any outstanding equity awards. In addition, Mr. Croteau's equity awards would remain exercisable for one year following termination of employment. Mr. Croteau will be subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions for the period during which he is entitled to receive salary continuation.  Mr. Virk is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides for payments upon an involuntary termination of employment by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in his employment agreement). Pursuant to Mr. Virk's employment agreement, if his employment is terminated other than for cause, he would be entitled to 90 days' prior written notice of the termination from the Company, and would receive continued monthly base salary for six months following termination (capped at $157,500 in the aggregate) and, at the Company's option, either continued medical and dental coverage for the same period or reimbursements of his out of pocket cost for obtaining such coverage for the same period. 
In addition, the CIC Plan, in which each of our named executive officers is currently a participant, provides that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• immediately prior to a "change in control" (as defined in the CIC Plan), subject to the terms and  conditions contained in the CIC Plan, any performance-based equity awards held by a participant will be deemed earned at maximum levels of performance as of immediately prior to the change in control and become, exercisable, vested and/or payable on  the later of the end of the originally applicable performance period and any further service-based vesting period relating to such award, subject to the participant's continued employment except as set forth below;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if a change in control occurs and a participant's employment is terminated by us without "cause"  (as defined in the CIC Plan) or a participant resigns from employment with us for "good reason" (as defined in the CIC Plan), in each case, within 3 months prior to and in connection with the change of control or within the two-year period following the change in control, the participant will be entitled to the following payments and benefits:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  the sum of the participant's annual base salary and target annual bonus for the year in which the  termination occurs (multiplied by 2 for Mr. Croteau and by 1.5 for Mr. McMullan), payable in a lump sum;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  a prorated annual bonus based on the participant's target annual bonus or, if greater and the termination  of employment occurs in the second half of the applicable bonus period, the estimated actual amount of such annual bonus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  a lump sum amount equal to the Company's estimate of the total cost of medical, dental and vision  continuation coverage under the Company's group health plan for the participant and his participating dependents for 24 months, in the case of Mr. Croteau, 18 months, in the case of Mr. McMullan, or 12 months, for each of the other  named executive officers, in each case, increased by the amount of federal and state taxes imposed on such payments; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  full vesting of all outstanding equity awards held by the participant.  
[END TABLE]
We will make an additional lump-sum cash payment to a CIC Plan participant if the participant becomes subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of any payment or benefit made or provided under the CIC Plan, either alone or when aggregated with any other payments or benefits. The net result of the additional payment is to place the participant in the same after-tax position as if the excise tax had not been imposed. 
In the event that a participant has an existing agreement with us relating to the participant's potential rights to severance pay, equity acceleration or benefits in connection with a change in control, such rights will be superseded by the rights of the participant under the CIC Plan with respect to any change in control occurring during the term of the CIC Plan, but such agreement otherwise will remain enforceable and in full force and effect. 
In addition to the benefits provided by the CIC Plan, our performance-vesting stock options become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to a change in control.  A summary of the potential payments that each of our named executive officers would have received upon the occurrence of these events, assuming that each triggering event occurred on September 28, 2018, for each named executive officer is set forth below.

  (1)  "Involuntary Termination" as used in this column includes involuntary termination without cause or a  voluntary termination with good reason, as and to the extent provided for in each named executive officer's employment arrangement. For Mr. Croteau, no amount has been included in the "Severance" column in respect of a prorated  bonus in fiscal 2018, because no bonus was payable for fiscal 2018 based on actual performance. Amounts listed in the "Health/Life Insurance Benefits" column have been calculated assuming that the cost of medical, dental and vision  continuation coverage under the Company's group health plan is $2,000 per month.

  (2)  All amounts listed beneath this heading represent benefits potentially payable under the CIC Plan.  "Involuntary Termination" as used in this column includes involuntary termination without cause or a voluntary termination with good reason, as and to the extent provided for in the CIC Plan. Amounts listed in the "Severance"  column are based on the annual base salaries and target annual bonuses in effect as of September 30, 2018 and have been calculated assuming that each named executive officer receives a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination of  employment equal to his target annual bonus. Amounts listed in the "Health/Life Insurance Benefits" column have been calculated assuming that the cost of medical, dental and vision continuation coverage under the Company's group  health plan is $2,000 per month.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  Amounts are based on the fair market value of our common stock of $20.60 per share, which was the closing price  of our common stock on September 28, 2018 as reported on Nasdaq, and have been calculated assuming that all outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Croteau that are scheduled to vest based on Mr. Croteau's continued service within  twelve months following September 28, 2018 vest in full. No amounts are included in respect of any stock options, which were all  out-of-the-money based on the closing price of our common stock on September 28, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  Amounts are based on the fair market value of our common stock of $20.60 per share, which was the closing price  of our common stock on September 28, 2018 as reported on Nasdaq, and have been calculated assuming that all outstanding equity awards vest in full, with outstanding performance-based restricted stock units earned at 300% with respect to future  fiscal years. No amounts are included in respect of any stock options, which were all out-of-the-money based on the closing price  of our common stock on September 28, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (5)  Amounts listed represent an estimate of the additional lump-sum payment  that would be payable if a named executive officer became subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, as described above based on the assumptions described above, and further assuming that (a) all performance-based restricted  stock units will be deemed earned at the maximum level of performance and will vest in full upon a qualifying termination of employment, based on a price per share equal to $20.60; (b) the full value of all equity awards so vesting will be parachute  payments; (c) each of the named executive officers receives a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination of employment equal to his target annual bonus; (d) the lump sum payment equal to the estimated cost of the Company's  medical, dental and vision continuation coverage is $2,000 per month; (e) each named executive officer is subject to the maximum applicable federal and state tax rates in effect for 2018; and (f) none of the parachute payments are exempt  under a special rule for reasonable compensation. Any actual entitlement to such additional lump-sum payment will be based on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time of a change in control or a  termination of employment in connection with a change in control. For Mr. Virk, the additional lump-sum payment that would be payable is based on Mr. Virk's compensation received from the  Company from 2014-2017 only (and does not take in account the compensation he received from Mindspeed in 2013, which could have a material impact on the estimated amount included above).

Pay Ratio 
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose in this proxy statement the ratio of the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our principal executive officer). 
We have determined that Mr. Croteau's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 was $5,079,356, as disclosed under the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above. Based on SEC rules and guidance and applying the methodology described below, we have determined that the median of the annual compensation, as described below, for all of our employees (other than our principal executive officer) for 2018 was $93,616. Accordingly, for fiscal year 2018, we estimate the ratio of our principal executive officer's annual total compensation to the median of the total annual compensation for all of our employees (other than our principal executive officer) was approximately 54 to 1. 
For purposes of determining our median employee, we selected the last day of our fiscal year, September 28, 2018, to establish our employee population. As of September 28, 2018, our employee population consisted of 1,445 employees, with 940 of these employees employed in the United States, and 505 of these employees employed in 18 other countries throughout the world, primarily in Europe, Asia, and India. As permitted by SEC rules, we excluded 50 employees in following countries under the de minimis exemption for purposes of identifying our median employee: Finland (1), France (22), Germany (4), Greece (1), Hong Kong (5), Italy (1), Netherlands (7), Philippines (2), South Korea (3) and the United Kingdom (4). As a result, for purposes of the pay ratio calculation, our employee population consisted of 1,395 employees, with 940 of these employees employed in the United States and 455 of these employees employed outside of the United States. 
For purposes of identifying our median employee we used a consistently applied compensation measure consisting of base salary or wages, excluding overtime pay, for the fiscal year ending on September 28, 2018. We annualized the actual base salary or wages paid to those employees who were not employed by us for the entire fiscal year. For employees outside of the United States, we used the foreign exchange rates that were effective as of the last day of our fiscal year to convert the base salaries and wages into U.S. dollars. 
Once the median employee was identified, as described above, that employee's total annual compensation for fiscal year 2018 was determined using the same rules that apply to reporting the compensation of our named executive officers (including our principal executive officer) in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC's rules and is based on our records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC's rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.  PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION 
OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, commonly referred to as the "say-on-pay" vote. 
In accordance with Exchange Act requirements, we are providing our stockholders with an opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation for fiscal year 2018, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. The Company's current policy, and the board of directors' recommendation contained in Proposal 3, is to submit the named executive officers' compensation to an advisory vote at its annual meeting of stockholders every three years. Assuming no change to the Company's current policy regarding the frequency of such advisory vote, it is expected that the next "say-on-pay" vote will occur at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. Although this advisory vote is nonbinding, our board of directors and compensation committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our named executive officer compensation and related executive compensation programs. 
As described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, our executive compensation program is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain the best executive talent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• motivate our executives to achieve our financial and business goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders to drive increased stockholder value.   
[END TABLE]
We encourage stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 16 of this Proxy Statement, which describes the processes our compensation committee used to determine the structure and amounts of the compensation of our named executive officers in fiscal year 2018 and how our executive compensation philosophy, policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives. The compensation committee and our board of directors believe that our executive compensation strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our named executive officers to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our stockholders. 
The board of directors recommends that stockholders indicate their support for the compensation of our named executive officers. The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation but rather the overall named executive officer compensation program as described in this Proxy Statement. 
Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any other related disclosure in this Proxy Statement." 
The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote "FOR" the Approval of the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers.  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON 
THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers as reflected in Proposal 2 above. Stockholders may indicate whether they prefer that we conduct future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers every one, two or three years. Stockholders also may abstain from casting a vote on this proposal. 
After careful consideration, the board of directors has determined that holding an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every three years is the most appropriate policy at this time, and recommends that future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers occur every third year. Our executive compensation program is designed to create long-term value for our stockholders, and a triennial vote will allow stockholders to better judge our executive compensation program in relation to our long-term performance. We also believe that a vote every three years is an appropriate frequency to provide sufficient time to thoughtfully consider stockholders' input and to implement any appropriate changes to our executive compensation program, in light of the timing that would be required to implement any decisions related to such changes. In addition, many large stockholders rely on proxy advisory firms for vote recommendations. We believe holding a triennial vote will help proxy advisory firms provide more detailed and thorough analyses and recommendations. 
Finally, the board of directors believes that a triennial vote would not foreclose stockholder engagement on our compensation program during interim periods. Stockholders are able to vote on the re-election of compensation committee members to the board of directors, and are also encouraged to provide input on our compensation policies directly to the board of directors. Thus, we view the advisory vote on executive compensation as an additional, but not exclusive, opportunity for our stockholders to communicate their views on our compensation program. 
Stockholders will be able to specify one of four choices for this proposal on the proxy card: one year, two years, three years or abstain. The voting frequency option that receives the highest number of votes cast by stockholders will be deemed the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation that has been selected by stockholders. Although this advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers is nonbinding, the board of directors and the compensation committee will carefully review and consider the voting results when determining the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers. Pursuant to the SEC's rules, our next advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers will occur at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. 
The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote in favor of "3 YEARS" on the Proposal Concerning the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes on the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers.  PROPOSAL 4: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS OUR 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The audit committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as our independent public accounting firm since fiscal year 2010. We expect that representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Our board of directors is submitting the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of corporate practice. If our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the audit committee may reconsider whether to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. 
The following table provides information regarding the fees billed by Deloitte & Touche LLP for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017. All services provided by, and fees paid to, Deloitte & Touche LLP as described below were pre-approved by the audit committee in accordance with the audit committee pre-approval policy set forth below.

This policy is set forth in the charter of the audit committee, which is available at http://ir.macom.com/governance-documents. The audit committee also considered whether the non-audit services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP were compatible with maintaining Deloitte & Touche LLP's independence as the independent registered public accounting firm of our financial statements and concluded that they were. 
The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote "FOR" the Ratification of the Appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Fiscal Year Ending September 27, 2019.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The audit committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018 with our management and Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee discussed with employees of the Company responsible for administering internal audit functions and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The audit committee meets with the employees of the Company responsible for administering internal audit functions and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting and compliance programs. We also discussed significant accounting policies applied in the Company's financial statements, as well as, when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management and the Company's internal and independent auditors also made presentations to the audit committee throughout the year on specific topics of interest, that include but are not limited to: (i) information technology systems, controls and security; (ii) critical accounting policies; (iii) the impact of new accounting guidance; (iv) compliance with internal controls required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (v) compliance with Company's Code of Conduct and Ethics; (vi) risk management initiatives and controls; (vii) significant legal matters; and (viii) insider and related party transactions. 
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles and internal control over financial reporting and has represented to the audit committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Deloitte & Touche LLP is responsible for (1) performing an independent audit of the financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and for expressing opinions on the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and (2) performing an independent audit of our internal control over financial reporting statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and for expressing an opinion thereon. 
The audit committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, and has received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the audit committee concerning independence. The audit committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP their independence and considered whether Deloitte & Touche LLP's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. The audit committee concluded that Deloitte & Touche LLP is independent from the Company and its management. 
Based on its reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
We describe below transactions and series of similar transactions to which we were a party since the beginning of our last fiscal year or will be a party in the future, and in which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the amounts involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our voting  securities, or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  
[END TABLE]
Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
Our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws ("Bylaws") limit the liability of each of our directors and provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our Bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer or director for any liability arising out of his or her actions in connection with their services to us, regardless of whether our Bylaws permit such indemnification. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers. These agreements, among other things, provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers for certain expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts reasonably incurred by such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in our right, on account of any services undertaken by such person on our behalf or that person's status as our director or officer. 
Acquisition of Nitronex, LLC 
In February 2014, we acquired Nitronex, LLC, f/k/a Nitronex Corporation ("Nitronex") (the "Nitronex Acquisition"). Prior to the Nitronex Acquisition, 100% of the outstanding membership interests in Nitronex were owned by GaAs Labs (a stockholder of the Company and an affiliate of our directors, Mr. and Mrs. Ocampo). We made a cash payment to GaAs Labs of $26.1 million at the closing of the Nitronex Acquisition for all of the outstanding ownership interests of Nitronex. The purchase price included $3.9 million held on account by a third-party escrow agent pending any claims by us in connection with representation and warranties made by GaAs Labs in the Nitronex Acquisition. The indemnification period expired in August 2015, at which point all but $500,000 of the escrow fund was released to GaAs Labs and the remainder was retained by the escrow agent pending final resolution of an outstanding indemnity claim. The indemnity claim was resolved during fiscal year 2018 and the remaining escrow funds were released to GaAs Labs. 
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. 
Cadence provides us with certain engineering licenses on an ongoing basis. Mr. Ribar, who joined our board of directors on March 22, 2017, served as an officer of Cadence through September 30, 2017 and served as a Senior Advisor to Cadence until March 31, 2018. During fiscal year 2018, we made payments of $4.1 million to Cadence prior to March 31, 2018. 
Second Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement 
We are party to an investors' rights agreement, as amended and restated on February 28, 2012 and further amended on May 20, 2013, February 2, 2015 and June 6, 2018 (the "IRA"), with a group of our stockholders that includes entities affiliated with Mr. and Mrs. Ocampo, who are both members of our board of directors and beneficial owners of more than 5% of a class of our voting securities, and including certain investment funds affiliated with Summit Partners, L.P., which is affiliated with another of our directors, Mr. Chung. Subject to the terms and conditions of the IRA, these stockholders have registration rights with respect to the shares of our capital stock or warrants they, or certain of their affiliates, hold, including the right to demand that we file a registration statement or request that their shares be covered by a registration statement that we are otherwise filing.  Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
We do not currently have a formal, written policy or procedure for the review and approval of related person transactions. However, our audit committee charter provides that our audit committee is required to review and approve or ratify any related person transactions, as defined under Regulation S-K Item 404. Our code of conduct and ethics also prohibits our directors and officers from engaging in a conflict of interest transaction without disclosure to and approval from the board of directors or one of its committees. Each of the related person transactions described above was reviewed and either approved or ratified by our audit committee, and we intend to follow this practice for any future related person transactions.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our directors, officers and beneficial holders of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. As a practical matter, we assist our directors and executive officers by monitoring transactions and completing and filing Section 16 reports on their behalf. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports and written representations from our executive officers and directors that no other reports were required, and except as otherwise disclosed in our 2018 annual proxy statement, we believe all required reports under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act of our directors, executive officers and beneficial holders of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities were timely filed since the beginning of fiscal year 2018, other than one late Form 4 filed on March 8, 2018 on behalf of Mr. Hwang to report open market purchases which, due to a clerical error on Mr. Hwang's broker's part, were not timely communicated to the Company. The Company addressed this matter with the broker and believes that the error has been resolved.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
List of Stockholders of Record 
In accordance with Delaware law, a list of the names of our stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for ten days prior to the Annual Meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. local time at our principal executive offices at 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851. This list will also be available at the Annual Meeting. 
Stockholder Proposals for Inclusion in 2020 Proxy Statement 
To be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy statement and form of proxy, stockholder proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on September 18, 2019, unless the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is more than 30 days before or after February 28, 2020, in which case the proposal must be received a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials. All proposals should be addressed to the following address: General Counsel, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851. 
Stockholder Proposals for Presentation at 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
For any proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, but is instead sought to be presented directly at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders are advised to review our Bylaws as they contain requirements with respect to advance notice of stockholder proposals not intended for inclusion in our proxy statement and director nominations. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received by our General Counsel at our principal executive offices not less than 45 days or more than 75 days prior to the first anniversary of the date we first mailed our proxy materials or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (whichever is earlier) for the prior year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Accordingly, any such stockholder proposal must be received between November 2, 2019 and December 2, 2019. However, in the event that the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after February 28, 2020, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the date on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is made. Copies of the pertinent Bylaw provisions are available on request to the following address: General Counsel, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851. 
As required by our Bylaws, any stockholder submitting a director nomination must include the name, biographical information and other relevant information relating to the recommended director nominee, including, among other things, information that would be required to be included in the proxy statement filed in accordance with applicable rules under the Exchange Act and the written consent of the director nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, among other requirements set forth in our Bylaws. 
Consideration of Stockholder-Recommended Director Nominees 
Our nominating and governance committee will consider director nominee recommendations submitted by our stockholders. In the event of any stockholder recommendations, the nominating and governance committee will evaluate the persons recommended in the same manner as other candidates. Stockholders who wish to recommend a director nominee must submit their suggestions to the following address: Chairperson of Nominating and Governance Committee, Attn: General Counsel, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851. 
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders may contact our board of directors as a group or any individual director by sending written correspondence to the following address: Board of Directors – MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.,   Attn: General Counsel, 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851. Stockholders should clearly specify in each communication the name(s) of the group of directors or the individual director to whom the communication is addressed. The General Counsel will review all correspondence and will forward to the board of directors or an individual director a summary of the correspondence received and copies of correspondence that the General Counsel determines requires the attention of the board of directors or such individual director. The board of directors and any individual director may at any time request copies and review all correspondence received by the General Counsel that is intended for the board of directors or such individual director. 
Delivery of Materials to Stockholders with Shared Addresses 
We have adopted a procedure, approved by the SEC, called "householding." Under this procedure, any stockholder, including both stockholders of record and beneficial holders who own their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, who share an address with another such holder of our common stock are only being sent one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of proxy materials, unless such holders have provided contrary instructions. Householding helps us reduce printing and postage cost associated with the distribution of proxy materials and helps to preserve natural resources. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of proxy materials to you upon written or oral request. If you wish to receive a separate copy of these materials or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive a single copy, please contact our investor relations department by phone at (978) 656-2500, or by writing to Investor Relations, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., 100 Chelmsford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851.
