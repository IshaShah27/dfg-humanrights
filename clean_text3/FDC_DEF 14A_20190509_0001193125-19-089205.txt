The Proxy Statement accompanying this Notice describes each of these items in detail. The Proxy Statement contains other important information that you should read and consider before you vote. 
The record date for the Annual Meeting is March 11, 2019. If you held First Data Class A common stock or Class B common stock at the close of business on that date, you are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
First Data is furnishing proxy materials to its shareholders through the Internet as permitted under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules, many shareholders will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement, our proxy card, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe this process gives us the opportunity to serve you more efficiently by making the proxy materials available quickly online and reducing costs associated with printing and postage. Shareholders who do not receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive these materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We are making this Proxy Statement available to you on or around March 28, 2019 because the Board is  soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 9, 2019. The information provided in this Proxy Statement is for your use in deciding how to vote on the proposals described below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is entitled to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You can attend and vote at the Annual Meeting if, as of the close of business on March 11, 2019 (Record  Date), you were a shareholder of record of First Data's Class A common stock or Class B common stock. As of the Record Date, there were 574,084,912 shares of our Class A common stock and 368,710,439 shares of our Class B  common stock outstanding.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are the voting rights of each class of stock?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  For each proposal, shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share of Class A common stock held  as of the Record Date and 10 votes for each share of Class B common stock held as of the Record Date. There are no cumulative voting rights.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I gain admission to the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a registered shareholder, you must bring with you the Notice of Internet Availability of  Proxy Materials and a government-issued photo identification (such as a valid driver's license or passport) or an employee badge issued by First Data to gain admission to the Annual Meeting. If you did not receive a Notice of Internet  Availability of Proxy Materials, please call our Investor Relations Department at (212) 266-3565 to request admission to the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares in street name and want to attend the Annual Meeting, you must bring your government-issued photo identification or an employee badge issued by First Data, together with: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials you received from your broker, bank or other holder of  record; or  
• A letter from your broker, bank or other holder of record indicating that you were the beneficial owner of First  Data stock as of the Record Date; or  
• Your most recent account statement indicating that you were the beneficial owner of First Data stock as of the  Record Date.  
[END TABLE]
All packages and bags are subject to inspection. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the difference between a registered shareholder and a shareholder who owns stock in street name?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you hold shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock directly in your name, you are  a registered shareholder. If you own your First Data shares indirectly through a broker, bank or other holder of record, those shares are held in street name.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I vote my shares before the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. If you are a registered shareholder, there are three ways to vote your shares before the  Annual Meeting:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet (www.proxyvote.com) – Use the Internet to transmit your voting instructions until  11:59 p.m. ET on May 7, 2019. Have your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card available and follow the instructions on the website to vote your shares.  
• By telephone  (1-800-690-6903) – Submit your vote by telephone until 11:59 p.m. ET on May 7, 2019. Have your Notice of Internet  Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card available and follow the instructions provided by the recorded message to vote your shares.  
• By mail – If you received a paper copy of the proxy materials, you can vote by mail by filling out the proxy  card enclosed with those materials and returning it using the instructions on the card. To be valid, proxy cards must be received before the start of the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name, your broker, bank or other holder of record may provide you with a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that contains instructions on how to access our proxy materials and vote online or to request a paper or email copy of our proxy materials. If you received these materials in paper form, the materials included a voting instruction card so you can instruct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares. 
Please see the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the information your bank, broker or other holder of record provided you for more information on these voting options. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I vote in person at the Annual Meeting instead of by proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a registered shareholder, you can vote at the Annual Meeting any shares that were  registered in your name as the shareholder of record as of the Record Date.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name, you cannot vote those shares at the Annual Meeting unless you have a legal proxy from the holder of record. If you plan to attend and vote your street-name shares at the Annual Meeting, you should request a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other holder of record and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we strongly encourage you to vote your shares by proxy before the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I revoke my proxy or change my voting instructions once submitted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a registered shareholder, you can revoke your proxy and change your vote before the  Annual Meeting by:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sending a written notice of revocation to our executive offices to the attention of our Corporate Secretary (the  notification must be received by 11:59 p.m. ET on May 7, 2019). The notice should be addressed as follows:  
[END TABLE]
First Data Corporation 
225 Liberty Street, 29th Floor 
New York, New York 10281 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting again by Internet or telephone before 11:59 p.m. ET on May 7, 2019 (only the latest vote you  submit will be counted); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting a new properly signed and dated paper proxy card with a later date (your proxy card must be received  before the start of the Annual Meeting).  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name, you should contact your broker, bank or other holder of record about revoking your voting instructions and changing your vote before the Annual Meeting. 
If you are eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting, you also can revoke your proxy or voting instructions and change your vote at the Annual Meeting by submitting a written ballot before the polls close. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What will happen if I submit my proxy but do not vote on a proposal?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you submit a valid proxy but fail to provide instructions on how you want your shares to be voted, properly  submitted proxies will be voted:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of all director nominees;  
• "FOR" the approval of, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers; and   
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as First Data's  independent registered public accounting firm.  
[END TABLE]
If any other item is properly presented for a vote at the meeting, the shares represented by your properly submitted proxy will be voted at the discretion of the proxies. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What will happen if I neither submit my proxy nor vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a registered shareholder, your shares will not be voted.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name, your broker, bank or other holder of record may vote your shares on certain "routine" matters. The ratification of independent auditors is currently considered to be a routine matter. On this matter, your broker, bank or other holder of record can: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote your street-name shares even though you have not provided voting instructions; or  
• Choose not to vote your shares.  
[END TABLE]
The other matters you are being asked to vote on are not routine and cannot be voted by your broker, bank or other holder of record without your instructions. When a broker, bank or other holder of record is unable to vote shares for this reason, it is called a "broker non-vote." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What does it mean if I receive more than one set of materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You probably have multiple accounts with us and/or brokers, banks, or other holders of record. You should vote  all of the shares represented by the notices/proxy cards. Certain brokers, banks, and other holders of record have procedures in place to discontinue duplicate mailings upon a shareholder's request. You should contact your broker, bank or other  holder of record for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many shares must be present to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  To carry on the business of the Annual Meeting, holders of a majority of the voting power of Class A  common stock and Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of the Record Date must be present in person or represented by proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is required to approve each proposal?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  For Proposal No. 1, directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of our  Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, which means that the three nominees  receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal No. 2, the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement, will be determined by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. However, our Board and Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. 
Proposal No. 3, the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, will be determined by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Are abstentions and broker non-votes counted in the vote totals?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker are not voted  with respect to a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and has not received voting instructions from its clients. If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not instruct your  broker how to vote, your broker will only have discretion to vote your shares on "routine" matters. Where a proposal is not "routine," a broker who has received no instructions from its clients does not have discretion to vote  its clients' uninstructed shares on that proposal. At our Annual Meeting, only Proposal No. 3 (ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. Your broker will therefore not  have discretion to vote on the election of directors as it is a "non-routine" matter.  
[END TABLE]
Broker non-votes and abstentions by stockholders from voting (including brokers holding their clients' shares of record who cause abstentions to be recorded) will be counted towards determining whether or not a quorum is present. However, as the three nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected, abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the election of Directors. With regard to the affirmative vote of the shares present at the meeting required for Proposal 3, it is a routine matter so there will be no broker non-votes but abstentions will have the effect of a negative vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How are votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In the election of directors, Proposal No. 1, you may vote "FOR" all or some of the nominees or  your vote may be "WITHHELD" with respect to one or more of the nominees.  
[END TABLE]
For Proposal No. 2 and Proposal No. 3, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN." If you elect to "ABSTAIN," the abstention has the same effect as a vote "AGAINST." 
If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card or over the telephone or Internet, the shares will be voted as recommended by our board of directors.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. The vote of any shareholder will not be revealed to anyone other than a tabulator of votes or an election  inspector, except (i) as necessary to meet applicable legal and stock exchange listing requirements, (ii) to assert claims for or defend claims against First Data, (iii) to allow the Inspectors of Election to certify the results of  the shareholder vote, (iv) in the event a proxy solicitation in opposition to First Data or the election of the Board takes place, (v) if a shareholder has requested that their vote be disclosed, or (vi) to respond to shareholders who  have written comments on Proxy Cards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Will any other business be transacted at the meeting? If so, how will my proxy be voted?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Management does not know of any business to be transacted at the Annual Meeting other than those matters  described in this Proxy Statement. The period specified in First Data's By-Laws for submitting additional proposals to be considered at the meeting has passed and there are no such proposals to be  considered. However, should any other matters properly come before the meeting, and any adjournments and postponements, shares with respect to which voting authority has been granted to the proxies will be voted by the proxies in accordance with  their judgment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who will pay the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including the preparation, assembly, printing, and  mailing of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying materials. We have engaged the firm of Morrow Sodali to assist in distributing and soliciting proxies for a fee of $6,500 plus expenses. However, the proxy solicitor fee is only a small fraction  of the total cost of the proxy process. The largest expense in the proxy process is printing and mailing the proxy materials. Proxies also may be solicited on behalf of First Data by directors, officers or employees of First Data in person or by  mail, telephone or facsimile transmission. No additional compensation will be paid to such directors, officers, or employees for soliciting proxies.  
[END TABLE]
 Proposal 1 – Election of Directors 
Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms. The terms of office of three current directors, Mr. Bisignano, Mr. Kravis, and Ms. Miller, expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Mr. Bisignano, Mr. Kravis, and Ms. Miller have been nominated for re-election through the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until a successor is elected and qualified. The nominees were recommended to the Board by the Governance and Nominations Committee. In making its recommendation, the Committee considered the experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of each nominee. All nominees have indicated their willingness to serve if elected. 
You have the opportunity to vote on the election of Mr. Bisignano, Mr. Kravis, and Ms. Miller. Additional information regarding each director nominee's experience, skills, and qualifications to serve as a member of our Board can be found beginning on page 11. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name    Age     Director Since    Summary Background    Independent     Committee Memberships 
Name    Age     Director Since    Summary Background    Independent     Committee Memberships 
[END TABLE]
The terms of Mr. de Castro, Mr. Nuttall, and Mr. Plumeri expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The terms of Mr. Nevels, Mr. Olson, and Ms. Yastine expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
If unforeseen circumstances (such as death or disability) make it necessary for the Board to substitute another person for any of the nominees, the proxies have the authority to vote your shares for that other person. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote to RE-ELECT Mr. Bisignano, Mr. Kravis, and Ms. Miller as directors.  Proposal 2 – Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
The Dodd-Frank Act enables our shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation table and related tables and disclosure (also referred to as "say-on-pay"). 
Before submitting your vote, we encourage you to read our Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 31 and the accompanying executive compensation tables beginning on page 41 for details about our executive compensation program, including information about the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers. 
As discussed in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we believe our executive compensation program is competitive and governed by pay-for-performance principles. We emphasize compensation opportunities that reward results. Our stock ownership requirements and use of equity-based incentives reinforce the alignment of the interests of our executives with those of our long-term shareholders. In doing so, our executive compensation program supports our strategic objectives and mission. 
We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers. Accordingly, we ask you to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders of First Data Corporation approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to First Data's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders under the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation table and related tables and disclosure." 
The advisory vote will not be binding on the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, they will carefully consider the outcome of the vote and take into consideration any specific concerns raised by investors when determining future compensation arrangements. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the resolution approving, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers.  Proposal 3 – Ratification of Selection of Auditors 
The Board of Directors recommends to the shareholders the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the accounts of First Data and its subsidiaries for 2019. Ernst & Young LLP, or one of its predecessors, has served as the independent registered public accounting firm for First Data or its predecessor entities since 1980. Consistent with regulations adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the lead audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the concurring audit partner are rotated every five years. 
A representative of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees and All Other Fees 
The following table shows the fees for audit and other services provided by Ernst & Young LLP for 2018 and 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $8.8    $7.5 
 Audit-Related Fees    6.0    4.8 
 Tax Fees    1.4    0.7 
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees
This category includes fees related to the integrated audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting; the review of our quarterly consolidated financial statements; comfort letters, consents, and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC; offering memoranda, purchase accounting and other accounting, and financial reporting consultation; statutory audits required domestically and internationally; and research work billed as audit fees or necessary to comply with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Audit-Related Fees
This category consists of fees for audit-related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements. Audit-related fees primarily include fees related to service auditor examinations, due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, attest services that are not required by statute or regulation, and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards not classified as audit fees. 
Tax Fees
This category consists of fees for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning services. 
All Other Fees
This category consists of fees for services that are not included in the above categories. There were no fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP in 2018 categorized as All Other Fees.  Audit Committee Pre-approval of Service of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Our Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services. Under the policy, our Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves services that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is subject to a specific pre-approved amount. Once pre-approved, the services and pre-approved amounts are monitored against actual charges incurred and modified if appropriate. The Chairperson of the Committee has the authority to pre-approve such services between meetings of our Audit Committee and such pre-approvals are reported to our Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting. 
During 2018, all audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP were pre-approved by our Audit Committee or, consistent with the pre-approval policy of our Audit Committee, by the Chairperson of our Audit Committee for inter-meeting pre-approvals. 
In the event the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will consider it a direction to select other auditors for the subsequent year. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it feels that such a change would be in the best interest of First Data and its shareholders. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR proposal 3.  Board of Directors

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
Barbara Yastine, a director of First Data, was the Co-Chief Executive Officer and a director of Lebenthal Holdings, LLC (Lebenthal) for approximately 9 months from September 2015 to June 2016. In November 2017, approximately 17 months after Ms. Yastine left that position, Lebenthal and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  Board Meetings and Director Attendance at Annual Meeting 
Our Board held 22 meetings in 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of all of the meetings of the Board and committees of the Board on which he or she served in 2018, except for Mr. Kravis who attended eighteen of twenty-seven meetings for a 67% attendance rate. 
Periodically at the end of Board meetings our Lead Director presides at an executive session without any management directors present.

In addition, an executive session including only independent directors is held at least once a year. Ms. Miller, as Chairperson of the Risk Committee, presides at such executive sessions. Members of the Audit Committee, Compensation, Governance and Nominations Committee, and Risk Committee also meet in executive session as needed. 
Directors are expected to attend our annual meetings of shareholders absent extraordinary circumstances and six directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Independence 
At this time, there are no independent directors on the Compensation Committee. When First Data is no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards, all of the Committee's members will be "independent" as defined under the NYSE listing standards within the time period permitted for such a transition by the NYSE listing standards. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of our Compensation Committee members has been one of our executive officers or employees at any time, except for Joseph J. Plumeri who was an employee of First Data until March 31, 2016. None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Committee.

Governance 
Director Independence 
Each year our Board determines which of our directors are independent. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, to be considered "independent" a director (1) must meet the independence standards under the NYSE listing standards; and (2) the Board must affirmatively determine that the director otherwise has no material relationship with First Data directly, or as an officer, shareholder, or partner of an organization that has a relationship with First Data. In making its independence determinations, the Board reviews any material direct and indirect relationships between each director and First Data, as well as the compensation and other payments each director received from or made to First Data. Our Board has determined that Mr. de Castro, Ms. Miller, Mr. Nevels, and Ms. Yastine are independent directors. For Ms. Miller, our Board considered her son's previous employment with First Data in a non-officer and non-strategic position. Given his position in the company and amount of compensation, the Board determined that his employment did not create a material relationship with First Data that would impair Ms. Miller's independence. 
Controlled Company Exception 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and its affiliates control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these rules, if more than 50% of the voting power of a company is held by an individual, group or another entity, the company is a "controlled company" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the requirement that a majority of the Board consist of "independent directors" as defined under the  rules of the NYSE;  
• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a  written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and  
• the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of  independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors on our Board and we do not have a nominating and corporate governance committee or a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. In the event that we cease to be a "controlled company," we will comply with these provisions within the transition periods specified in the corporate governance rules of the NYSE.  Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board has extensive involvement in the oversight of risk management related to us and our business and accomplishes this oversight through the regular reporting by the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee. The Risk Committee represents the Board by overseeing our risk governance structure, risk assessment, and risk management practices, and making recommendations to the Board regarding our willingness to accept risks and strategies related to key risks. The Audit Committee represents the Board by periodically reviewing our accounting, reporting, and financial practices, including the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, the surveillance of administrative and financial controls and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Through its regular meetings with management, including the finance, legal, and internal audit functions, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses all significant areas of our business and summarizes for the Board all areas of financial risk and the appropriate mitigating factors. In addition, our Board receives periodic detailed operating performance reviews from management. 
Our executive officers regularly report to the Board, including the non-management directors, and the Audit, the Compensation, the Governance and Nominations, and the Risk Committees to ensure effective and efficient oversight of our activities and to assist in proper risk management and the ongoing evaluation of management controls. The Head of Internal Audit reports administratively to our Chief Control Officer and directly to the Audit Committee. We believe that the leadership structure of our Board provides appropriate risk oversight of our activities given the controlling interest held by KKR. 
Lead Director 
Our governance framework provides the Board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure. In making leadership structure determinations, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the our shareholders. The current leadership structure is comprised of a combined Chairperson of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, a Lead Director, and four Board committees. The directors believe that the positions of Chairperson and CEO currently should be held by the same person, as this combination has served us well by providing unified leadership and direction for the Board. 
If the individual elected as Chairperson is also an employee of First Data, the Board believes that a Lead Director should be appointed to help ensure robust leadership on the Board. Accordingly, the non-management directors have elected Scott Nuttall as Lead Director. As Lead Director, Mr. Nuttall assists in optimizing the effectiveness of the Board by performing the duties described below.

Policies Regarding the Approval of Transactions with Related Parties 
Our Related Party Transaction Policy requires Board approval of any transactions over $120,000 between First Data and an executive officer, director, 5% or more shareholder, or an immediate family member of any of such individual. 
In addition, under our Director Code of Conduct, each director must report to our General Counsel upon learning of any prospective transaction or relationship in which the director will have a financial or personal interest (direct or indirect) that is with us, involves the use of our assets, or involves competition against us (consistent with any confidentiality obligation the director may have). Our General Counsel must then advise our Board of any such transaction or relationship and our Board must pre-approve any material transaction or relationship. 
Under our Code of Conduct, executive officers may not use their personal influence to get us to do business with a company in which they, their family members or their friends have an interest. In situations where an executive officer is in a position of influence or where a conflict of interest would arise, the prior approval of our General Counsel is required. 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
In September 2016, Mr. Bisignano's daughter married a current employee of First Data, Sam Lituchy. For fiscal 2018, First Data paid Mr. Lituchy compensation and benefits of $176,555 and granted him 4,885 restricted stock units having a value of approximately $78,990 on the date of grant. 
Anti-Hedging, Anti-Short Sale, and Anti-Pledging Policies 
We prohibit our directors, executive officers, and employees from engaging in hedging or monetization transactions, including forward sales and various option strategies that may allow an individual to continue to own First Data's common stock without the full risks and rewards of an unhedged position. In addition, our directors, executive officers, and employees are prohibited from engaging in transactions in publicly traded options of First Data, including calls, puts, swaps or other derivative instruments with similar characteristics, whether listed on an exchange or transacted on other organized markets. Directors, executive officers, and employees are also prohibited from engaging in short sales related to First Data's common stock. We also prohibit our directors, executive officers, and employees from pledging First Data common stock, including holding common stock in a margin account, without the written consent of our General Counsel.  Director Nominations 
Our Board is responsible for nominating directors for election by the shareholders and filling any new positions or vacancies on the Board that may occur. The Governance and Nominations Committee is responsible for identifying, screening, and recommending candidates to the Board for Board membership. Shareholders may also propose nominees for consideration by the Committee by writing to First Data Secretary, c/o General Counsel Office, First Data Corporation, 225 Liberty Street, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10281. In formulating its recommendations, the Governance and Nominations Committee will consider recommendations offered by any shareholder, director, or officer of First Data. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that, along with the charters of the Board committees, provide the basic framework for the Board's operation and role in the governance of First Data. You can find our Corporate Governance Guidelines on our website at www.firstdata.com under "Investors" and "Corporate Governance." 
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted an Employee Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees, a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer, and a Directors' Code of Ethics, which applies to our directors. These Codes can be viewed on our website at www.firstdata.com under "Investors" and "Corporate Governance." On the same website, we will post amendments to a provision of such codes and waivers from the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 573,901,310 shares of Class A common stock and 368,734,686 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at March 1, 2019. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options, restricted stock or other convertible securities held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or vested or that will become exercisable or vested within 60 days of March 1, 2019. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. 
Except as indicated by the footnotes below, (a) all amounts are as of March 1, 2019, (b) we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities listed have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares they beneficially own, and (c) the address of each beneficial owner is c/o First Data Corporation, 225 Liberty Street, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10281.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Based on a review of reports filed with the SEC by our directors and executive officers regarding their ownership and transactions in our common stock and written representations from those directors and officers, we believe that each director and executive officer has filed timely reports under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during 2018.  Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Introduction 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain quality individuals, as well as to motivate them to help us achieve our financial goals and create shareholder equity value. Our named executive officers (NEOs) are paid on performance, primarily in time- and performance-vested equity, and competitively to the market. Our compensation plans tie a substantial portion of our NEO's total compensation to the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals. 
Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee views compensation awarded for 2018 as including base salary and performance-based compensation awarded in 2019 for 2018 performance. The table below shows how the Board and Compensation Committee view compensation for each NEO for fiscal 2018. The Summary Compensation Table prepared in accordance with the SEC disclosure rules that appears later in this proxy has additional information and this table is not intended as a replacement. 
Similarly to past years, we granted cash and equity incentive compensation for 2018 in the first quarter of 2019. The Summary Compensation Table includes the cash and equity incentive granted in the year they are made. So, for 2018, the Summary Compensation Table includes the cash incentive paid for 2018 performance but equity compensation granted for 2017 performance. The Summary Compensation Table also includes sign on equity grants that are provided to retain the services of a new executive and align the interests of the new executive with the interests of shareholders but are not part of what the Committee considers as regular annual compensation. The table below reflects both cash and equity compensation for 2018 performance excluding sign on equity grants. 
Additionally, the Summary Compensation Table includes all other compensation which is not reflected in the table below.

 How We Determine Compensation 
Role of the Governance, Compensation and Nominations Committee 
Our Compensation Committee (the Committee) approves all aspects of compensation for executive officers, including the form and compensation amounts. Specifically, the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● establishes our compensation philosophy in consultation with management and oversees managements  development and implementation of our compensation and benefits policies;  
● evaluates performance and sets executive officers compensation,  
● oversees our equity plans; and  
● determines how best practices in good governance should be applied on compensation topics.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors, however, approves equity grants to executive officers, generally after Committee recommendations, to exempt the grants from short-swing profit rules. In 2018, the Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Kravis, Plumeri, and Nuttall (Chair). 
Role of Independent Consultant 
Our Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and replace compensation consultants to provide it with independent advice. The Compensation Committee has engaged Johnson Associates, Inc. as its independent consultant to advise on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. This selection was made without the influence of management. 
Role of Management in Executive Officer Compensation Decisions 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and General Counsel generally provide information, data, analysis, updates, and compensation recommendations to the Committee. Management periodically engages compensation consultants to assist it in this process, and it utilizes market data from a wide variety of sources. Ultimately, the Compensation Committee makes the final decisions on executive officer compensation matters. As part of the Committee's compensation setting process, our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Committee regarding compensation for executive officers other than himself. 
Highlights of our Compensation Practices 
Although we are a controlled company, we adhere to certain best practices regarding compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
              ✓        Clawback  Provisions: We have clawback provisions for equity compensation, requiring executives to repay amounts when it is subsequently determined they should not have received them.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 ☒   Hedging and Pledging of Our Stock: We prohibit all employees and  directors from hedging First Data stock.

Adopting New Best Pay Practices 
The Committee considers best pay practices for public companies, including new trends and developments, in determining compensation. The Committee is committed to implementing additional best pay practices over time, if it determines such changes are in the best interest of shareholders. 
Our Compensation Philosophy and Strategy 
We structure our compensation to reinforce growth goals and sustained share value creation. In particular: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We focus on total compensation, which combines salary and incentives  
● Align individual awards with client and shareholder success  
● We use equity as the primary pay component  
● We emphasize pay for performance, differentially rewarding high-performers  
● We pay competitively, compared to market  
[END TABLE]
Use of Equity and Share Retention Requirements 
The Committee seeks to align the interests of management with that of shareholders by granting most of our NEOs' total compensation in equity that increases in value as our financial performance improves. The Committee also seeks to retain management by requiring employment through equity vesting periods to receive the full value of equity-based awards. The Committee believes the design of the long-term equity awards should: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● emphasize shareholder value  
● focus our executive officers on sound management of the company  
● create shareholder value while driving the business forward by achieving corporate goals  
[END TABLE]
As further described below, the Committee's first quarter 2019 equity-based awards reflect this approach: the awards generally vest over three years and generally require continued employment through each vesting date. 
As described in more detail below, our CEO must retain at least 90% of the stock acquired from equity compensation, net of taxes, and charitable donations, until employment termination. With certain exceptions described below, our other NEOs must retain at least 75% of the stock from equity compensation, net of taxes, charitable donations, through employment termination. These are among the most rigorous share retention requirements of any public company.  Pay our NEOs Based on Performance 
We are committed to rewarding executives based on our performance. The Committee believes the majority of our executive officers' pay should be incentive compensation – a combination of annual cash bonuses and long-term equity awards. At the end of each year, the Committee determines how First Data performed across various financial and qualitative objectives. The Committee then determines awards for each NEO, based both on Company and individual performance. 
The Committee also determines how the award for prior year performance will be paid. For 2018, the award was paid in two forms: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A cash award under our Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the SEIP)  
● An award of time vested restricted stock  
[END TABLE]
The Committee has designed our executive officers' compensation so that they receive a significant portion in long-term equity. In 2018, the Committee determined that our NEO's, excluding new hires John Whorley and Samir Zabaneh, would receive 100% of their incentive compensation in time vested restricted stock to further align our executive officers' interests with our shareholders. This decision reflects the long-term perspective and support the Compensation Committee has for our NEO's. 
Market Competitive Pay 
The Committee wants to ensure executives are paid competitively. In order to successfully attract and retain top performing executives, our Human Resources Department reviews market data and aims to provide our executives with competitive total compensation opportunities. 
The Chief Executive Officer, Human Resources Department, and the Committee periodically review our executive compensation practices against a peer group of companies. Our peer group includes direct competitors, frequently identified peer companies to our direct competitors, and other companies comparable to us in terms of industry, pay practices, revenue and market value. In 2016, Johnson Associates assisted the Committee in adjusting the peer group to reflect First Data today. The peer group considered by the Committee to determine 2018 NEO compensation included the following 16 companies:

 Summary of 2018 Compensation 
2018 Performance  
For 2018, we considered the following aspects of our performance* to determine our NEO compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We delivered segment revenue growth, segment EBITDA growth, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow within or above the  guidance we set in February 2018  
● We grew year-over-year segment revenues by 6% on an organic constant currency basis which exceeded both our  initial guidance issued in February 2018 and our revised guidance issued in April 2018  
● We grew our segment EBITDA to $3.3 billion, up 8% on an organic constant currency basis but below our  internal budget for the year  
● We delivered fully-diluted adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 which was above our initial guidance issued in  February 2018 but below our internal budget and our revised guidance issued in April 2018  
● We delivered free cash flow in excess of $1.4 billion  
[END TABLE]
* Segment revenue, segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow, as well as their growth rates, are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on how these metrics are calculated, see "Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" on page 40. 
Elements of 2018 Compensation 
In January 2018, the Committee determined our NEOs' total compensation packages based on Company and individual performance. Compensation included the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary    In effect at December 31, 2018 
 Incentive Compensation    Annual cash incentive under the Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the SEIP) Time vested restricted stock 
 Incentive Compensation    Annual cash incentive under the Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the SEIP) Time vested restricted stock 
 Other Compensation    Benefits and perquisites, as detailed below 
[END TABLE]
Base salary provides executives with a level of cash income predictability. The Committee believes base salaries for executives should reflect market competitive levels and factors such as experience and breadth of responsibilities, performance, individual skill set, pay relative to peers within First Data, and base pay in previous roles outside of First Data. Initial base salaries for our NEOs are agreed to at the time of hiring. Each executive officer is reviewed annually and is eligible for a discretionary annual merit increase. Base salaries may also be adjusted at other times to deal with competitive pressures or changes in job responsibilities. No NEO received a base salary increase for 2018.  
The following table shows our NEOs' annual base salaries as of December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Frank J. Bisignano Chief Executive  Officer    $1,320,000 
 Himanshu A. Patel Executive Vice  President Chief Financial Officer    $600,000 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Guy Chiarello President    $1,000,000 
 Samir Zabaneh Executive Vice President  and Strategic Advisor    $579,777 
 John (Jeff) Whorley, Executive Vice  President, Head of First Data Education    $600,000 
[END TABLE]
2018 Incentive Compensation 
Each NEO is eligible for an annual discretionary cash incentive and equity based on First Data's performance against our strategic growth objectives and individual performance. Consistent with our overall compensation philosophy, cash incentives are generally much smaller than long-term equity awards. 
For 2018, the Board, with input from management, established a budget that included strategic goals for our performance. These goals included targets for segment revenue, segment EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. These were the basis of First Data's performance portion of incentive pay for 2018. 
The Committee also considers individual performance and contribution in meeting our strategic goals. The Committee considers a number of factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the overall performance of the executive;  
● the effective management of expenses;  
● the effective management of risk;  
● demonstration of leadership, teamwork, and innovation; and  
● the extent of the accomplishment of our strategic goals.  
[END TABLE]
The size of awards is based primarily on our annual financial performance, but individual performance is also considered. To best accomplish this, the Committee approved a fully discretionary funding structure for 2018 annual incentive compensation. This structure allowed the Committee to maintain the ability to appropriately reward the performance of each NEO. 
The Committee determined the total incentive compensation for each NEO would be flat or decreased from the previous year based on the 2018 performance of the Company discussed above which, although met most of the guidance parameters set during the year, did not accomplish all of the goals set in the internal budget, and leadership of each individual NEO to achieve the results. 
After determining the total compensation for each NEO, the Committee determines the mix between cash and equity. For 2018, we elected to pay Messrs. Bisignano, Patel, and Chiarello's annual incentive in time vested restricted stock. We believe this decision best aligns the NEO's interest with creating value for shareholders. Messrs. Whorley and Zabaneh were hired by First Data in 2018 and received an annual cash incentive award amounting to approximately 9% and 20% of their total incentive, respectively. 
2018 Cash Incentive Awards 
The annual cash incentives for 2018 performance under the SEIP were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Frank J. Bisignano Chief Executive  Officer    $0 
 Himanshu A. Patel Executive Vice  President Chief Financial Officer    $0 
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
2019 Equity-Based Grants Based on 2018 Performance 
In the first quarter of 2019, the Committee granted the awards shown below under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The grants reflect the portion of 2018 incentives made in time vested equity. The awards have the following terms: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● restricted stock that generally vests in three installments, 20% on the first grant anniversary, 40% on the  second anniversary and 40% on the third anniversary, subject to continued employment on each vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Frank J. Bisignano Chief Executive  Officer    421,626    $10,625,000 
 Himanshu A. Patel Executive Vice  President, Chief Financial Officer    71,428    $1,800,000 
 Guy Chiarello President    173,412    $4,370,000 
 Samir Zabaneh Executive Vice President  and Strategic Advisor    19,728    $497,170 
 John (Jeff) Whorley, Executive Vice  President, Head of First Data Education    23,809    $600,000 
[END TABLE]
Benefits and Perquisites 
We focus on performance-based compensation while providing only minimal executive benefits. We do provide to all of our employees, including our NEOs, broad-based employee benefits that are intended to attract and retain employees while providing them with retirement and health and welfare security. These include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a 401(k) savings plan; and  
● medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance coverage, and dependent care and flexible spending  accounts.  
[END TABLE]
We do not currently offer defined benefit pension benefits or non-qualified retirement benefits to our NEOs. We also do not currently offer a Company match in our 401(k) savings plan. 
We provide our NEOs with limited perquisites and personal benefits not generally available to all employees such as reimbursements for relocation, housing, and moving expenses. In limited instances NEOs are also authorized to use the corporate aircraft or a car and driver for personal purposes. Per his employment agreement, Mr. Bisignano is provided with use of a car and driver and is eligible for financial planning assistance and use of the corporate aircraft. In addition, from time to time we provide tax gross-ups on perquisites in order to allow our NEOs to enjoy the full benefit of the perquisite.  Executives of companies are required to make filings and pay fees pursuant to regulations issued under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act before an executive exceeds certain levels of stock ownership in a company. Mr. Bisignano was required to make filings under the Act in 2018 because of the amount of First Data stock he has acquired. The Committee recognized that the Company's strategy to pay a significant portion of CEO compensation in equity and the equity retention policy requiring the CEO to hold 90% of net equity compensation were key drivers that caused Mr. Bisignano to need to make the filings and incur the associated fees. The Committee decided that in light of the role the Company's strategy and retention guidelines played in creating the obligation that the Company would pay the costs incurred to make the filing. 
Severance and Change in Control Agreements 
We believe that reasonable and appropriate severance and change in control benefits are necessary in order to be competitive in First Data's executive attraction and retention efforts. Our severance and change in control policy provides for payment rights, and benefits to the NEOs (other than Mr. Bisignano) on an involuntary termination of employment without cause. Under the policy, the cash severance is equal to one year's base pay plus the bonus paid for the prior year before termination, if any, and a prorated bonus based on time worked during the year of termination. As a condition to receiving severance, all participating NEOs must release First Data and its employees from all claims they may have against them and agree to a number of restrictive covenants which are structured to protect us from potential loss of customers or employees and to prohibit the release of confidential company information. For Mr. Bisignano, his employment agreement described below provides for a cash severance payment equal to (1) the greater of (a) $9.5 million or (b) two times the sum of his base salary and the average of his annual incentive payments paid in cash in respect of the two fiscal years prior to the date of his termination and (2) a pro rata portion of the annual incentive payment that would have otherwise been payable if he had remained employed through such year. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
We have an equity retention policy for our directors, NEOs, and all other members of our Management Committee, which require them to maintain a minimum share ownership level throughout their employment. Equity retention requirements are also in place for our highly compensated employees. 
Members of our Management Committee must retain at least 75% of the stock they acquire through equity compensation (net of taxes, transaction costs, and charitable donations) as long as they are employed by us. Our Chief Executive Officer and directors must retain at least 90% of the stock they acquire through equity compensation (net of taxes, transaction costs and charitable donations) as long as they are either employed by us or serve as a director. Under the policy, stock acquired through compensation plans includes vested restricted stock, restricted stock units, vested options, stock held after exercising options and vested equity contributed to qualified or non-qualified retirement plans, but does not include unvested restricted stock, unvested restricted stock units or unvested stock options. 
Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the chairperson of the Committee, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● where the retention commitment would create a financial hardship (in such instances, the Committee may also  approve an alternative ownership plan that reflects both the intention of the policy and the individuals circumstances); or  
● other situations that the Chief Executive Officer deems appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
If the Chief Executive Officer or a director requests an exception, that request must be submitted to the chairperson of the Committee for their review and approval.  Clawback Provisions 
We have a policy to clawback incentive compensation of executive officers in the event of a subsequent accounting restatement to ensure that incentive compensation is rightfully earned by the executives. 
Hedging and Pledging Prohibition 
As part of our insider trading policy, all employees, including our named executive officers, and non-employee directors are prohibited from engaging in short sales or hedging transactions involving our securities. They are also prohibited from establishing margin accounts or otherwise pledging our securities. Exceptions to this policy may only be granted by the written consent of our General Counsel. 
Compensation and Risk 
The Committee believes that the design and objectives of our executive compensation program provide an appropriate balance of incentives for executives and avoid inappropriate risks. In this regard, our executive compensation program includes, among other things, the following design features: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Balances a mix of fixed versus variable, at-risk compensation;   
● Balances a mix of short and long-term incentive compensation;  
● Provides that variable compensation is based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative performance goals;   
● Provides for a clawback of executive compensation in specified circumstances; and  
● Share ownership guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
The Compensation Committee recognizes the tax and regulatory factors that can influence the structure of executive compensation programs. While the Committee considers tax deductibility as one factor for determining executive compensation, the Committee also considers the accounting implications of the various elements of our compensation program, including the impact on our financial results and the dilutive impact to stockholders of various forms of compensation. 
Prior to January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibited a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than $1 million for any fiscal year to the chief executive officer and the three highest paid executive officers excluding the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. However, specific forms of performance-based compensation were excluded from the $1 million deduction limit assuming certain requirements were met. 
Effective January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) was amended to prohibit a tax deduction for all compensation greater than $1 million, including performance-based compensation, paid to its (i) principal executive officer, (ii) principal financial officer, (iii) any individual who served or acted in the capacity of either of the former roles at any time during the tax year, (iv) three highest paid executive officers excluding the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and (v) any employee who during any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016 was considered the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or one of the three highest paid executive officers excluding the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the company or a predecessor. 
These changes to Section 162(m) included certain transition rules under which the changes to Section 162(m) regarding the deductibility of performance-based compensation would not apply to compensation payable   pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, and was not materially modified after that date. 
For 2018, we expect to be able to claim the benefit of a special exemption rule that applies to compensation paid (or compensation in respect of equity awards such as stock options or restricted stock granted) during a specified transition period following the IPO. This transition period may extend until the first annual stockholders' meeting that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the IPO occurred, unless the transition period is terminated earlier under the Section 162(m) post-offering transition rules. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Form 10-K.

2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
Unless otherwise governed by the applicable award agreement and/or grant notice for the applicable grant(s) at issue, the First Data Corporation 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan) provides for the treatment of awards granted under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan upon certain terminations. 
A participant's Termination for Cause will result in all outstanding Options granted to the Participant immediately terminating and expiring. A Participant's Termination due to death or Disability will result in each outstanding unvested Option granted to such Participant immediately terminating and expiring and each outstanding vested Option remaining exercisable for one year thereafter, but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period. A Participant's Termination for any other reason will result in each outstanding unvested Option granted to such Participant immediately terminating and expiring and each outstanding vested Option remaining exercisable for ninety (90) days thereafter, but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period. 
Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the 2015 Plan have the same treatment as Options upon the termination of a Participant as discussed above.  In the event of a Participant's Termination for any reason, the Participant's Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units granted under the 2015 Plan that are unvested will result in all vesting with respect to such Participant's Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ceasing and unvested shares shall be forfeited to First Data by the Participant for no consideration as of the date of such Termination. 
In the event of a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee of the Board shall make such proportionate substitutions or adjustments, if any, as it deems equitable to the terms of any outstanding awards. 
2007 Stock Incentive Plan 
Unless otherwise governed by First Data Corporation Severance/Change in Control Policy and/or any other employment agreements, offer letters, the applicable award agreement and/or grant notice for the applicable grant(s) at issue, or any other arrangements between the applicable executive and First Data, the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of First Data Corporation and its Affiliates (2007 Stock Incentive Plan) provides for the treatment of awards granted under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan upon certain events and terminations. 
Upon a Change in Control (as defined under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan), if determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board in the applicable grant agreement or otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board in its sole discretion, any outstanding grants then held by Participants which are unexercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions may automatically be deemed exercisable or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions as of immediately prior to the Change in Control and the Compensation Committee of the Board may, as allowed under Section 409A of the Code, cancel such awards for fair value as determined under the Plan, provide for the issuance of substitute awards or provide that for a period of at least ten business days prior to the Change in Control, any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable as to all shares subjected thereto. 
The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan provides that the grant agreements issued under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan must provide for the treatment of the grant in the event of the termination of employment or other service relationship, death or disability of the Participant and may also include provisions concerning the treatment of the grant in the event of a Change in Control. 
The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan Form Stock Option grant agreement provides that all unexercisable options as of the date of Participant's termination of employment for any reason shall immediately expire. Options that are unvested Time Options that would have vested on the next anniversary of the Closing Date shall vest pro rata for terminations of employment resulting from death or Disability, termination without Cause or resignation by the Participant for Good Reason. For unvested Performance Options that would have vested had the Participant remained employed through the end of the Fiscal Year in which the termination of employment occurs shall vest pro rata to the extent First Data meets its performance goals for terminations of employment resulting from death or Disability, termination without Cause or resignation by the Participant for Good Reason. 
Exercisable options expire as follows with regards to the various terminations of employment unless the option expires first due to its expiration date on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date. Options expire immediately upon the date of the Participant's termination of employment for Cause or termination of employment by the Participant without Good Reason.

For all other NEOs, reflects cash severance payable under the Policy as in effect on January 1, 2017,  assuming a termination date of December 31, 2017.  
  (2)  Upon termination of Mr. Bisignano's employment by First Data without "cause", by  Mr. Bisignano for "good reason", due to Mr. Bisignano's "disability" or due to First Data's non-renewal of the employment term, Mr. Bisignano is entitled to receive  health insurance, excess disability and life insurance coverage until his death, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Employment Agreement (Retiree Benefits). In addition, upon termination of Mr. Bisignano's employment with  First Data by Mr. Bisignano without "good reason", in addition to certain accrued amounts, Mr. Bisignano will be entitled to receive the Retiree Benefits. The Retiree Benefits in this table assumes Mr. Bisignano dies at age  80 and benefits are not terminated before then. With respect to the other NEOs, represents First Data-paid portion of medical, dental and vision benefits for each executive for a period of one year under the Policy.  
  (3)  Upon termination of Mr. Bisignano's employment by First Data without "cause", by  Mr. Bisignano for "good reason", or due to First Data's non-renewal of the employment term, Mr. Bisignano is entitled to receive payment, in installments over the Severance Period of  an amount equal to financial planning benefits for two years following his termination of employment.

  (4)  Mr. Bisignano's 2013 stock option agreement provides that, in the event of a termination of  employment due to death or "disability," by him for Good Reason or by First Data without Cause, the unvested options that would have otherwise vested during the 12 month period following such termination will immediately vest and become  exercisable. Messrs. Chiarello's and Patel's 2013 stock option agreements contain the same provision as Mr. Bisignano's 2013 stock option agreement.  
[END TABLE]
Other than as specifically provided in Mr. Bisignano's 2013 stock option agreement and not including the stock options granted in connection with the IPO, with respect to all other outstanding stock options held by the NEOs, in the event of a termination of an NEO's employment due to death or "disability", by the NEO for "good reason" or by First Data without "cause", the unvested options that would have vested on the next anniversary of the grant date will vest pro-rata as determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock subject to the option that would have so vested by a fraction, the numerator of which corresponds to the number of completed months of employment since the anniversary of the grant date immediately preceding the date of the termination of employment and the denominator of which is 12. 
For all stock options granted to the NEOs in connection with the IPO, in the event of a termination due to death or "disability", by the NEO for "good reason" or by First Data without "cause", the unvested time options that would have vested on the next Time-Vesting Date vest pro-rata as determined by multiplying the number of Time Options that would have vested on such next Time-Vesting Date by a fraction, the numerator of which corresponds to the number of completed months of employment since the Time-Vesting Vesting Date immediately preceding the date of the termination of employment and the denominator of which is 12. 
In the event of a termination prior to the Performance Vesting Date for the Performance Options that were granted to the NEOs in connection with the IPO, all unvested Performance Options shall be forfeited as of the date of the termination of employment. 
In addition, in the event of a Change in Control, all unvested options become fully vested, except for the Performance Options granted in connection with the IPO. If the Performance Vesting Date has not occurred and the IPO does not result in a transaction equal to or exceeding $32.00, then all Performance Options will be forfeited as of the date of the Change in Control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (5)  The terms of restricted stock awards with time-based vesting issued to NEO, provide that, if the NEO's  employment terminates due to death or disability or is terminated by First Data without cause or by the NEO for good reason, awards will vest immediately. Grants with performance-based vesting will not vest immediately upon death or disability.  Rather, these awards will remain outstanding for three years following death or disability and only vest if the performance conditions are met within that three year period. All option grants that vest will continue to be exercisable for three years  after death or disability.

  (6)  Under the terms of Mr. Bisignano's Employment Agreement, First Data agreed that during the term of  the Employment Agreement and for a period of two years thereafter, it would continue for his benefit the tax-gross up provided under the Policy as in effect as of the date of the Employment Agreement.   
[END TABLE]
Under the terms of the Policy, a "Gross-Up Payment" is made if it is determined that any Code Section 280G parachute payments provided by First Data to or, on behalf of, an eligible executive would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999. The Gross-Up Payment is an amount so that after payment of all taxes, the eligible executive retains an amount equal to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999. 
However, if it is determined that the executive officer is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment but the payments to the executive officer do not exceed 110% of the amount which is one dollar less than the smallest amount that would give rise to any excise tax, then no Gross-Up Payment will be made and the payments will be reduced so as to not give rise to the excise tax. Executive officers are eligible for this payment regardless of whether their employment is terminated in connection with a Change in Control. 
However, the provision in the Policy regarding "Gross-Up Payments" will not apply with respect to any payment that would otherwise be subject to the excise tax if such excise tax would be avoided by obtaining stockholder approval of the payment in the manner prescribed by Code Section 280G. As of December 31,   2018, the excise tax could have been avoided by obtaining stockholder approval pursuant to Code Section 280G. Accordingly, no amounts are reflected above. 
Description of Termination Provisions 
Bisignano Employment Agreement Termination Provisions 
Upon termination of Mr. Bisignano's employment by First Data without "cause", by Mr. Bisignano for "good reason", due to Mr. Bisignano's death or "disability" (all as defined in the Bisignano Agreement) or due to First Data's non-renewal of the employment term, conditioned upon the execution and effectiveness of a release of claims against First Data and its affiliates and in addition to certain accrued amounts, Mr. Bisignano will be entitled to receive (1) payment, in installments ratably over a 24 month period (Severance Period), of an amount equal to the greater of (X) $9.5 million or (Y) two times the sum of his base salary and the average of his annual incentive payments paid in cash in respect of the two fiscal years prior to the date of his termination (provided, that if Mr. Bisignano's employment is terminated by him for "good reason" following a "change of control" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) within two years following such "change of control", the payment will be made in a lump sum cash payment) and (2) a pro rata portion of the annual incentive payment, if any, that would have otherwise been payable in respect of such year if he had remained employed through such year. In addition, Mr. Bisignano is entitled for continued health insurance coverage in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA), including medical and dental coverage and excess disability and life insurance coverage during the COBRA period. First Data's portion of the cost of such coverage and the provision of the coverage itself will be borne/provided by First Data in a manner that does not affect its medical plan or otherwise result in adverse tax consequences as determined in its sole discretion. Thereafter, and until Mr. Bisignano's death (Retiree Benefits), First Data shall provide Mr. Bisignano with health insurance, excess disability and life insurance coverage that is reasonable comparable to the coverage provided to Peer Executives under such policies at such time. However, in the event that First Data determines in its reasonable judgment that maintaining the Retiree Benefits would adversely affect its medical plan or the benefits paid thereunder or would result in penalties under Public Health Service Act section 2716 or related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any other applicable law, then First Data may cease providing the Retiree Benefits to Mr. Bisignano and in lieu thereof agrees to pay Mr. Bisignano, on the first business day of each month, a monthly amount equal to First Data's allocable portion of the cost of such Retiree Benefits. Mr. Bisignano's rights to the Retiree Benefits shall terminate as of (i) the date on which reasonably comparable health insurance is made available to Mr. Bisignano by a subsequent employer, including First Data, or through the employment of his spouse, if any, or (ii) if Mr. Bisignano's employment with First Data was terminated by Mr. Bisignano without Good Reason or due to Mr. Bisignano's election not to extend the Term, in each case, the date on which Mr. Bisignano commences any employment, consulting, advisory, directorship, agency, promotional or independent contractor arrangement with any person or Entity (as defined in the Employment Agreement) (other than any such arrangement in which Mr. Bisignano serves solely as a non-executive director). 
In addition to the amounts described above, on the 60th day after Mr. Bisignano's termination of employment, to the extent not theretofore paid, Mr. Bisignano shall be entitled to: (A) any other accrued but unpaid Base Salary to the date of termination of employment; (B) any Annual Incentive Payments earned but unpaid for fiscal years ended prior to the year in which the date of termination occurs; (C) contingent upon the execution and effectiveness of the Release prior to the 60th day after Mr. Bisignano's termination of employment, a pro rata portion of the Annual Incentive Payment, if any, for the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs, equal to the product of (x) the full Annual Incentive Payment amount that would otherwise be payable in respect of such year if Mr. Bisignano had remained employed through such year, if any, without any reduction due to individual performance factors, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year to the date of termination and the denominator of which is 365, with such incentive payment amount to be paid in the calendar year   following the year in which Mr. Bisignano's termination occurred at the time that the full Annual Incentive Payment amount would have been paid had Mr. Bisignano's employment not been terminated, (D) to the extent applicable to Mr. Bisignano and to the extent provided under the terms of the Severance/Change in Control Policy (as defined in the Employment Agreement), if any outstanding cash incentive awards granted to Executive are eligible to become fully vested and payable solely contingent upon Mr. Bisignano's continued employment hereunder and the passage of time, continued vesting of such awards, with payment of such awards to be made in accordance with the awards' terms, notwithstanding Mr. Bisignano's earlier termination of employment, (E) any unreimbursed business expenses incurred prior to the date of termination and to which Mr. Bisignano is entitled to be reimbursed under Section 5(f) of the Employment Agreement and (F) other amounts or accrued benefits required to be paid or provided or which Mr. Bisignano is eligible to receive (whether on such 60th day or thereafter) under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of First Data (all of such other amounts and benefits referred to Section 9(a)(ii) of the Employment Agreement shall be referred to as the Other Benefits). For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Bisignano shall not be a participant in that certain Company Severance/Change in Control Policy as amended and restated effective as of September 24, 2007 and amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, as it may be further amended from time to time. 
Severance/Change in Control Policy 
We believe that reasonable and appropriate severance and Change in Control benefits are necessary in order to be competitive in our executive attraction and retention efforts. As such, we adopted the First Data Corporation Severance/Change in Control Policy (Management Committee Level) (Policy) which provides for certain payments, rights and benefits to the NEOs (other than Mr. Bisignano) upon an involuntary termination of employment without cause or for good reason with or without a Change in Control. 
The Policy provides for the following payments, rights and benefits for Eligible Executives (as defined in the Policy) who are involuntarily terminated (other than for Cause or due to Disability) or who voluntarily terminate for Good Reason, after January 1, 2016: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  an amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of the executive's Base Salary and the incentive award  paid to the executive, if any, pursuant to the SEIP (or the incentive plan then applicable to the executive) for the year immediately preceding the year in which the termination date occurs, and (ii) one (1) year (Severance Period); plus   
  (2)  A pro-rata portion of the incentive award paid to the Eligible  Executive pursuant to the SEIP (or the incentive plan then applicable to the executive) for the year immediately preceding the year in with the termination date occurs. Such payment is based on the portion of the year the Eligible Executive was  actively employed by First Data;  
  (3)  Continuation of medical, dental and vision benefits coverage for the Severance Period (i.e., one year) with a  portion of the costs of the benefits paid by the executive officer;  
  (4)  Continued vesting of outstanding cash incentive awards granted to the executive officer that vest and are  payable solely contingent upon continued employment and the passage of time, notwithstanding the executive officer's earlier termination of employment; and  
  (5)  A "Gross-Up Payment" is made if it is determined that any  Internal Revenue Code section 280G parachute payments provided by First Data to or, on behalf of, an eligible executive would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code section 4999. The Gross-Up Payment is  an amount so that after payment of all taxes, the eligible executive retains an amount equal to the excise tax imposed by Code section 4999. However, if it is determined that the executive officer is entitled to a  Gross-Up Payment but the payments to the executive officer do not exceed 110% of the amount which is one dollar less than the smallest amount that would give rise to any excise tax, then no Gross-Up Payment will be made and the payments will be reduced so as to not give rise to the excise tax.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Executive officers are eligible for this payment regardless of whether their employment is terminated in  connection with a Change in Control.  
        However, the provision in the Policy regarding "Gross-Up  Payments" will not apply with respect to any payment that would otherwise be subject to the excise tax if such excise tax would be avoided by obtaining stockholder approval of the payment in the manner prescribed by Code Section 280G,  which is not applicable to us now following the IPO.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, in the Committee's sole discretion, executive officers may also be eligible for outplacement services selected by First Data. 
As a condition to receiving severance payments and benefits under the Policy, all employees are required to release First Data and its affiliates from all claims they may have against them and agree to a number of restrictive covenants which are structured to protect First Data from potential loss of customers or employees and to prohibit the release of confidential company information. Severance payments under the Policy that are not subject to Code Section 409A may be paid in installments or a lump sum payment and severance payments that are subject to Code Section 409A are paid in installments. 
We have reserved the right to amend or terminate the Policy at any time in our sole discretion, provided, however, that during the period commencing on the closing of the 2007 merger and ending on the 36 month anniversary of a Change in Control (other than the 2007 merger), we are not permitted to amend or terminate the Policy without the consent of each affected executive officer. 
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
In accordance with SEC guidelines, the Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our CEO's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 to that of the median employee for the same period. The calculation of annual total compensation of the median employee was determined in the same manner as the "Total Compensation" shown for our CEO in the "Summary Compensation Table." Pay elements that were included in the annual total compensation for each employee are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary received in fiscal year 2018  
• Annual incentive payment received for performance in fiscal year 2018  
• Grant date fair value of stock option and RSU awards granted in fiscal year 2018  
• Company-paid Insurance Premiums during fiscal year 2018  
• Own It Honor Awards in merchandise or cash that an employee receives for exemplary work based on recommendations  from fellow employee  
[END TABLE]
Our calculation of our median employee includes all employees as of October 1, 2018. We determined the compensation of our median employee by calculating the annual total compensation described above for each of our employees and identifying the median employee. The annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for our CEO was $12,131,386 and for the Median Employee was $49,805. The resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our Median Employee for fiscal year 2018 is 244 to 1.

 Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the integrity of First Data's financial statements, First Data's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications, performance and independence of First Data's independent registered public accounting firm, and the performance of First Data's internal auditing department. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing and retaining our independent auditor and approving the audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor. 
Our management is responsible for preparing our financial statements and ensuring they are complete and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young LLP (EY), our independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, was responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and with EY, with and without management present. These audited financial statements are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In connection with that review, the Audit Committee considered and discussed the quality of First Data's financial reporting and disclosures, management's assessment of First Data's internal control over financial reporting and EY's evaluation of First Data's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed with EY the matters required to be presented and communicated to the audit committee by Auditing Standard No. 1301, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. This review included a discussion with management and the independent auditor of the quality, and not just the acceptability, of First Data's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments and the disclosures in First Data's consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. 
In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with EY its independence from management and First Data, as well as the matters in the written disclosures and the letter received from EY required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding EY's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has reviewed all fees paid to EY during the fiscal year and has considered the compatibility of EY's performance of non-audit services with the maintenance of EY's independence as First Data's independent auditor. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to First Data's board of directors that First Data's audited financial statements be included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

To be eligible for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting, a shareholder proposal must be received by our Corporate Secretary by no later than November 29, 2019, and must comply in all respects with applicable rules of the SEC. Shareholder proposals should be addressed to First Data Corporation, c/o Corporate Secretary, 225 Liberty Street, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10281. 
A shareholder may present a proposal not included in our proxy materials from the floor of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders only if our Corporate Secretary receives notice of the proposal, along with additional information required by our by-laws, between January 10, 2020 and February 9, 2020. Notice should be addressed to First Data Corporation, c/o Corporate Secretary, 225 Liberty Street, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10281. 
Delivery of Proxy Materials to Households 
SEC rules allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household at which two or more shareholders reside. We believe this rule benefits everyone. It eliminates duplicate mailings that shareholders living at the same address receive, and it reduces our printing and mailing costs. This rule applies to any annual reports, proxy statements, proxy statements combined with a prospectus and information statements. First Data Corporation
