We are furnishing our proxy materials to holders of our common         stock as of the close of business on March 26, 2018. We will begin distributing a notice of internet availability of our proxy materials to the holders of our common stock           on or about March 27, 2019.  Our proxy materials include:
[BEGIN TABLE]

· our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended                    December 31, 2018; and  
· a proxy card or voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
We are not incorporating the 2018 annual report into this proxy statement and you should not consider the         annual report as proxy solicitation material.  The accompanying notice of annual meeting of shareholders sets forth the time, place and purposes of the meeting.  Our principal executive offices are located at Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway,         Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas 75240‑2697.
Please refer to the Glossary of Terms on page ii for the definitions of certain         terms used in this proxy statement.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the purpose of the annual meeting?  
A:  At the annual meeting, shareholders will vote on the following, as described in this proxy statement:  
· Proposal 1 – the election of the six director nominees named in this proxy statement; and  
· Proposal 2 – the adoption of a nonbinding advisory resolution that approves the named executive officer                    compensation described in this proxy statement (Say-on-Pay).  
[END TABLE]
In addition, shareholders will vote on any other matter that may properly come before the meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How does the board recommend that I vote?  
A:  The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR:  
· the election of each of the nominees for director named in this proxy statement; and  
· the approval and adoption of proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay).  
[END TABLE]
Q: Who is allowed to vote at the annual meeting?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The board of directors has set the close of business on March 18, 2019 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to                      vote at the meeting.  Only holders of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote at the meeting.  On the record date, 48,727,484 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding.  Each                      share of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote.  
Q:  Why did I receive a notice regarding the internet availability                        of proxy materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials?  
A:  Pursuant to the SEC notice and access rules we furnish proxy materials                      over the internet to both our shareholders of record and our shareholders who hold our common stock through a brokerage firm or other nominee.  We                      believe that taking advantage of these rules expedites our shareholders' receipt of proxy materials, while also lowering the costs associated with conducting our annual meeting.  You can find instructions on how to access and review the                      proxy materials, and how to vote over the internet, on the notice of internet availability of proxy materials that you received.  The notice also contains                        instructions on how you can receive a paper copy of this proxy statement, our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and a voting instruction form or proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
Q: How do I vote if I am a shareholder of record?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you hold shares of our common stock in your name in certificate form or electronically with our transfer agent, Computershare, and not through a brokerage                      firm or other nominee, you are a shareholder of record.  As a shareholder of record, you may:  
· vote over the internet at www.aalvote.com/NL;  
· vote by telephone using the voting procedures set forth on your proxy card;  
· instruct the agents named on your proxy card how to vote your shares by completing, signing and mailing the proxy                    card in the envelope provided; or  
· vote in person at the annual meeting.  
Q:  What are the consequences if I am a shareholder of record and I execute my proxy card but do not indicate how I would like my shares voted                      for one or more of the director nominees named in this proxy statement or proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay)?  
A:  If you are a shareholder of record the agents named on your proxy card will vote your shares on such uninstructed nominee or proposal as recommended by the                      board of directors in this proxy statement.  
Q:  How do I vote if my shares are held through a brokerage firm or other nominee?  
A:  If you hold your shares through a brokerage firm or other nominee, you must follow                              the instructions on your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or on your voting instruction form, on how to vote your shares.  In order to ensure your brokerage firm or other nominee votes your shares in the manner you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm or other nominee by the deadline                        provided on your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
Brokerage firms or other nominees may not vote your shares on the election of a director nominee or proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay) in the absence of your specific instructions as to how to vote.  We encourage you to provide instructions to your brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting           of your shares.  If you do not instruct your brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote with respect to the election of a director nominee or proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), your           brokerage firm or other nominee may not vote with respect to the election of such director nominee or on proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay) and your vote will be counted as a "broker/nominee non-vote."  "Broker/nominee non-votes" are non-votes by a brokerage firm or other nominee for shares held in a client's account for which the brokerage firm or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on a           particular matter and has not received instructions from the client.  How we treat broker/nominee non-votes is separately described in each of the answers below regarding what constitutes a quorum and the requisite votes necessary to elect a           director nominee or approve proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay).
- 2 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  If I hold my shares through a brokerage firm or other nominee, how may I vote in person at the annual meeting?  
A:  If you wish to vote in person at the annual meeting, you will need to follow the                        instructions on your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or voting instruction form on how to obtain the appropriate documents to vote in person at the meeting.  
Q:  Who will count the votes?  
A:  The board of directors has appointed Alliance Advisors to ascertain the number of shares represented, tabulate the vote and serve as inspector of election for                      the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Q: Is my vote confidential?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes.  All proxy cards, ballots or voting instructions will be kept confidential in accordance with our by-laws.  
[END TABLE]
Q: How do I change or revoke my proxy instructions if I am a shareholder of record?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a shareholder of record, you may change or revoke your proxy instructions in any of the following ways:  
· delivering to Alliance Advisors a written revocation;  
· submitting another proxy card bearing a later date;  
· changing your vote on www.aalvote.com/NL;  
· using the telephone voting procedures set forth on your proxy card; or  
· voting in person at the annual meeting.  
Q:  How do I change or revoke my voting instructions if my shares are held through a brokerage firm or other nominee?  
A:  If your shares are held through a brokerage firm or other nominee, you must follow the instructions from your brokerage firm or other nominee on how to change                      or revoke your voting instructions or how to vote in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Q: What constitutes a quorum?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A quorum is the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Shares that are voted           "abstain" or "withheld" are counted as present and entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.
As already discussed in the           previous answer regarding how to vote shares held through a brokerage firm or other nominee, there are no proposals for the 2019 annual meeting that would allow           a brokerage firm or nominee to vote uninstructed shares.  If a brokerage firm or other nominee receives no instruction for the election of any director nominee and receives no instruction for proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), such uninstructed shares will be counted as not entitled to vote and are, therefore, not considered for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.  If a           brokerage firm or other nominee receives instructions on the election of at least one director nominee or on proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), such instructed shares will           be counted as present and entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.
Valhi directly held approximately 82.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record         date.  Valhi has indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the meeting.  If Valhi attends the meeting in person or by proxy, the meeting will have a quorum present.
- 3 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Assuming a quorum is present, what vote is required to elect a director nominee?  
A:  A plurality of affirmative votes of the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock represented and entitled to vote at the meeting is necessary to                      elect each director nominee.  You may indicate on your proxy card or in your voting instructions that you desire to withhold authority to vote for any of the director nominees.  Since director nominees need only receive a plurality of                      affirmative votes from the holders represented and entitled to vote at the meeting to be elected, a vote withheld or a broker/nominee non-vote regarding a particular nominee will not affect the election of such director nominee.  
[END TABLE]
Valhi has indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the meeting and         to vote such shares FOR the election of each of the director nominees named in this proxy statement.  If Valhi attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the shareholders will elect all of the nominees named in this proxy         statement to the board of directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Assuming a quorum is present, what vote is required to adopt and approve proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay)?  
A:  The shareholder resolution contained in this proposal provides that the                        nonbinding affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the requisite vote to adopt the resolution and approve the compensation of our named executive officers as such compensation is disclosed in this proxy statement.  Abstentions                        will be counted as represented and entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.  Broker/nominee non-votes will not be counted as entitled to vote and will have no effect on this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
Valhi has indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the meeting and         to vote such shares FOR this nonbinding advisory proposal.  If Valhi attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the shareholders will, by a nonbinding advisory vote, approve this proposal.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Assuming a quorum is present, what vote is required to approve any other matter to come before the meeting?  
A:  Except as applicable laws may otherwise provide, the approval of any other matter that may properly come before the meeting will require the affirmative votes                      of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting.  Abstentions will be counted as represented and                        entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  If I am a shareholder of record, how will the agents named on my proxy card vote on any other matter to come before the meeting?  
A:  If you are a shareholder of record and to the extent allowed by applicable law, the agents named on your proxy card will vote in their discretion on any other                      matter that may properly come before the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Q: Who will pay for the cost of soliciting the proxies?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We will pay all expenses related to the solicitation, including charges for preparing, printing, assembling and distributing all materials delivered to                      shareholders.  In addition to the solicitation by mail, our directors, officers and regular employees may solicit proxies by telephone or in person for which such persons will receive no additional compensation.  Upon request, we will                      reimburse brokerage firms or other nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in distributing proxy materials and voting instructions to the beneficial owners of our common stock that hold such stock in accounts with                      such entities.  
[END TABLE]

CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER
Valhi is the direct holder of approximately 82.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of         the record date.  Valhi has indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the meeting and to vote such shares FOR the election of each of the director nominees named in this proxy statement and FOR proposal 2         (Say-on-Pay).  If Valhi attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the meeting will have a quorum present and the shareholders will elect all of the nominees named in this proxy statement to the board of directors and approve         proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay).

· elect Patty S. Brinda as our vice president and controller.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Controlled Company Status, Director Independence and Committees.  Because of Valhi's direct ownership of approximately 82.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, we are considered a controlled company under         the listing standards of the NYSE.  Pursuant to the listing standards, a controlled company may choose not to have a majority of independent directors, independent compensation, nominations or corporate governance committees or charters for these         committees.  While we currently have a majority of independent directors, we have chosen not to have an independent nominations or corporate governance committee or charters for these committees.  Our board of directors believes that the full board         of directors best represents the interests of all of our shareholders and that it is appropriate for all matters that would otherwise be considered by a nominations, corporate governance or risk oversight committee to be considered and acted upon         by the full board of directors.  Applying the NYSE director independence standards without any additional categorical standards, our board of directors has determined that Keith R. Coogan, John E. Harper, Meredith W. Mendes, Cecil H. Moore, Jr. and         Thomas P. Stafford are independent and have no material relationship with us other than serving as our directors.  While the members of our management development and compensation committee currently satisfy the independence requirements of the         NYSE, we have chosen not to satisfy all of the NYSE corporate governance standards for a compensation committee, including not having a charter for our management development and compensation committee.
- 12 -
2018 Meetings and Standing Committees of the Board of Directors.  The board of directors held six meetings in 2018.  Each of our directors then in office attended at least 75% of such meetings and the 2018 meetings of         the committees on which he or she served at the time.  It is expected that each director nominee will attend our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, which is held immediately before the annual meeting of the board of directors.  All of our         directors who were elected at our 2018 annual shareholder meeting attended such meeting.
The board of directors has established and delegated authority to two standing committees, which are         described below.  The board of directors is expected to elect the members of the standing committees at the board of directors annual meeting immediately following the annual shareholder meeting.  The board of directors from time to time may         establish, other committees to assist it in the discharge of its responsibilities.
Audit Committee.  Our audit committee assists with the board of directors' oversight responsibilities relating to our financial accounting and reporting processes and auditing processes.  The purpose, authority,         resources and responsibilities of our audit committee are more specifically set forth in its charter.  Applying the requirements of the NYSE corporate governance standards (without additional categorical standards) and SEC regulations, as         applicable, the board of directors has determined that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· each member of our audit committee is independent, financially literate and has no material relationship with us                    other than serving as our director; and  
· Cecil H. Moore, Jr., Meredith W. Mendes and John E. Harper are each an "audit committee financial expert."  
[END TABLE]
No member of our audit committee serves on more than three public company audit committees.  For further         information on the role of our audit committee, see the Audit Committee Report in this proxy statement.  The current members of our audit committee are Thomas P. Stafford (chairman), Keith R. Coogan (who is not standing for reelection as a         director), John E. Harper, Meredith W. Mendes and Cecil H. Moore, Jr.  Our audit committee held seven meetings in 2018.
Management Development and Compensation Committee.  The principal responsibilities of our management development and compensation committee are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to recommend to the board of directors whether or not to approve any proposed charge to us or any of our                    privately held subsidiaries pursuant to our ISA with Contran;  
· to review certain matters regarding our defined benefit plans or programs;  
· to review, approve, administer and grant awards under our equity compensation plan; and  
· to review and administer such other compensation matters as the board of directors may direct from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
As discussed above, the board of directors has determined that each member of our management development         and compensation committee is independent by applying the NYSE director independence standards (without additional categorical standards).  The management development and compensation committee may delegate to its members or our officers any or all         of its authority as it may choose subject to certain limitations of New Jersey law on what duties directors may delegate.  The management development and compensation committee has delegated to a committee of our officers the authority to oversee         the administration of the benefit plans sponsored by us for our retirees and their dependents.  With respect to the role of our executive officers in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive compensation, see the Compensation         Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.  With respect to director cash compensation, our executive officers make recommendations on such compensation directly to our board of directors for its consideration without involving the         management development and compensation committee.  The current members of our management development and compensation committee are Thomas P. Stafford (chairman) and Keith R. Coogan (who is not standing for reelection as a director).  Our         management development and compensation committee held two meetings in 2018.
- 13 -
Risk Oversight.  Our board of directors oversees the actions we take in managing our material risks.  Our management is responsible         for our day-to-day management of risk.  The board's oversight of our material risks is undertaken through, among other things, various reports and assessments that           management presents to the board and the related board discussions.  The board has delegated some of its primary risk oversight to our audit committee and management development and compensation committee.  Our audit committee annually receives           management's reports and assessments on, among other things, the risk of fraud, certain material business risks and a ranking of such material business risks and our insurance program.  The audit committee also receives reports from our         independent registered public accounting firm regarding, among other things, financial risks and the risk of fraud.  Our management development and compensation committee           receives management's assessments on the likelihood that our compensation policies and practices could have a material adverse effect on us, as more fully described in the Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management         section of this proxy statement.  The audit committee and management development and compensation committee report to the board of directors about their meetings. We believe the leadership structure of the board of directors is appropriate for our         risk oversight.
Identifying and Evaluating Director Nominees.  Historically, our management has recommended director nominees to the board of directors.  As stated in our corporate governance guidelines:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our board of directors has no                    specific minimum qualifications for director nominees;  
· each nominee should possess the necessary business background, skills and expertise at the policy-making level                    and a willingness to devote the required time to the duties and responsibilities of membership on the board of directors; and  
· the board of directors believes that experience as our director is a valuable asset and that directors who have                    served on the board for an extended period of time are able to provide important insight into our current and future operations.  
[END TABLE]
In identifying, evaluating and determining our director nominees, the board of directors follows such corporate governance         guidelines.  The board also considers the nominee's ability to satisfy the need, if any, for required expertise on the board of directors or one of its committees.  While we do not have any policy regarding the diversity of our nominees, the board         does consider diversity in the background, skills and expertise at the policy making level of our director nominees, and as a result our board believes our director nominees possess a diverse range of senior management experience that aids the         board in fulfilling its responsibilities.  The board of directors believes its procedures for identifying and evaluating director nominees are appropriate for a controlled company under the NYSE corporate governance standards.
Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors and Independent Director Meetings.  Loretta J. Feehan serves as our chair of the board           (non-executive), and Robert D. Graham serves as our vice chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  The board of directors believes our current leadership structure is appropriate for a controlled company under the NYSE corporate         governance guidelines.  While there is no single organizational structure that is ideal in all circumstances, the board of directors believes that having different individuals serve as our chair of the board (non-executive) and as our chief         executive officer reflects the established working relationship for these positions regarding our business and provides an appropriate breadth of experience and perspective that effectively facilitates the formulation of our long-term strategic         direction and business plans.  In addition, the board of directors believes that since Ms. Feehan is a representative of Contran, her service as our chair of the board (non-executive) is beneficial in providing strategic leadership for us since         there is a commonality of interest that is closely aligned in building long-term shareholder value for all of our shareholders.  We have in the past, and may in the future, have a leadership structure in which the same individual serves as our         chairman of the board and as our chief executive officer. In those instances, the individual has been, or would be expected to be, an employee or representative of Contran.
Pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines, our independent directors are entitled to meet on a         regular basis throughout the year, and will meet at least once annually, without the participation of our other directors who are not independent.  We are not required to have a lead independent director under the NYSE corporate governance         standards.  While we do not have a lead independent director, the chairman of our audit committee presides at all of the meetings of our independent directors.  In 2018, we complied with the NYSE requirements for meetings of our independent         directors.

Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for shareholder action at our annual shareholder meetings,         consistent with rules adopted by the SEC.  We must receive such proposals not later than November 28, 2019 to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy card relating to our annual meeting of shareholders in 2020.  Our         by-laws require that the proposal set forth a brief description of the proposal, the name and address of the proposing shareholder as they appear in our records, the number of shares of our common stock the shareholder holds and any material         interest the shareholder has in the proposal.
The board of directors will consider the director nominee recommendations of our shareholders in         accordance with the process discussed above.  Our by-laws require that a nomination set forth the name and address of the nominating shareholder, a representation that the shareholder will be a shareholder of record entitled to vote at the annual         shareholder meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the nominee, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and the nominee (or other persons pursuant to which the nomination         is to be made), such other information regarding the nominee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC and the consent of the nominee to serve as a director if elected.
For proposals or director nominations to be brought at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders but not         included in the proxy statement for such meeting, our by-laws require that the proposal or nomination must be delivered or mailed to our principal executive offices in most cases no later than February 16, 2020.  Proposals and nominations should be         addressed to our corporate secretary at NL Industries, Inc., Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas 75240‑2697.
Communications              with Directors.  Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the board of directors or its independent directors may do so through the following procedures.  Such communications not involving complaints or         concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters related to us may be sent to the attention of our corporate secretary at NL         Industries, Inc., Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas  75240-2697.  Provided that any such communication relates to our business or affairs and is within the function of our board of directors or its committees, and         does not relate to insignificant or inappropriate matters, such communication, or a summary of such communication, will be forwarded to the chairman of our audit committee, who also serves as the presiding director of our independent director         meetings.
Complaints or concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters, which         may be made anonymously, should be sent to the attention of our general counsel with a copy to our chief financial officer at the same address as our corporate secretary.  These complaints or concerns will be forwarded to the chairman of our audit         committee.  We will investigate and keep these complaints or concerns confidential and anonymous, to the extent feasible, subject to applicable law.  Information contained in such a complaint or concern may be summarized, abstracted and aggregated         for purposes of analysis and investigation.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation.  During 2018 Thomas P. Stafford and Keith R. Coogan served on our management development and compensation committee.  No member of the committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· was an officer or employee of ours during 2018 or any prior year;  
· had any related party relationships with us that requires disclosure under applicable SEC rules; or  
· had any interlock relationships under applicable SEC rules.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, no executive officer of ours had any interlock relationships within the scope of the intent of applicable SEC         rules.  However, during 2018 Robert D. Graham was an executive officer of ours and on the board of directors of Contran when concurrently also serving as one of our directors.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics.  The code applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal         financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller.  Only the board of directors may amend the code.  Only our audit committee or other committee of the board of directors with specifically delegated authority may grant a waiver of this         code.  We will disclose amendments to or waivers of the code as required by law and the applicable rules of the NYSE.
- 15 -
Corporate Governance Guidelines.  We have adopted corporate governance guidelines to assist the board of directors in exercising its responsibilities.  Among other things, the corporate governance guidelines provide         for director qualifications, for independence standards and responsibilities, for approval procedures for ISAs and that our audit committee chairman preside at all meetings of the independent directors.
Availability of Corporate Governance Documents.  A copy of each of our audit committee charter, code of business conduct and ethics and corporate governance guidelines is available on our website at www.nl-ind.com under the corporate         governance section of the investor relations page.

COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
AND OTHER INFORMATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis.  This compensation discussion and analysis describes the key principles and factors underlying our executive compensation policies for our named executive officers.  In each of the         last three years, all of our named executive officers were employed by Contran and provided their services to us pursuant to our ISA with Contran.  Such individuals also provided services to CompX and Kronos Worldwide under Contran's ISAs with         those companies.
As defined in the Glossary of Terms at the beginning of this proxy statement, the phrase "named         executive officers" refers to the five persons whose compensation is summarized in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.  Such phrase is not intended to refer, and does not refer, to all of our executive officers.
Nonbinding              Advisory Shareholder Vote on Executive Officer Compensation.  For the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, we submitted a nonbinding advisory proposal           recommending the shareholders adopt a resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the 2018 proxy statement.  At the annual meeting, the resolution received the affirmative vote of 86.6% of the shares of our common stock eligible to vote at the annual meeting.  We considered the              favorable result and determined not to make any material changes to our compensation practices.
Intercorporate Services Agreements.  We pay Contran a fee for services provided by Contran to us pursuant to our ISA with Contran, which fee was approved by our independent directors after receiving the recommendation         of our management development and compensation committee and the concurrence of our chief financial officer.  Such services provided under this ISA included the services of our named executive officers, all of which as noted above were employed by         Contran, and as a result a portion of the aggregate ISA fee we paid to Contran was paid for services provided to us by our named executive officers.  The nature of the duties of each of our named executive officers who are employees of Contran are         consistent with the duties normally associated with the officer titles and positions such officer holds with us.  Pursuant to Contran's ISAs with CompX and Kronos Worldwide, those companies also paid a fee to Contran for, among other things, the         services our named executive officers provided to those companies, which fees were approved by the independent directors of those companies.
The charges under these ISAs reimburse Contran for its cost of employing the personnel         who provide the services by allocating such cost to us based on the estimated percentage of time such personnel were expected to devote to us over the year.  The amount of the fee we paid for each year under these ISAs for a person who provided         services to us represents, in management's view, the reasonable equivalent of "compensation" for such services.  See the Intercorporate Services Agreements part of the Certain Relationships and Transactions section of this proxy statement for the         aggregate amount we paid to Contran in 2018 under these ISAs.  Under the various ISAs among Contran and its subsidiaries and affiliates, we share the cost of the employment of our named executive officers with Contran and certain of its other         publicly and privately held subsidiaries.  For our named executive officers, the portion of the annual charge we paid for each of the last three years to Contran under these ISAs attributable to each of their services is set forth in the 2018         Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.  As discussed further below, the amounts charged under the ISAs are dependent upon Contran's cost of employing or engaging the personnel who provide the services to us (including the services of         our named executive officers) by allocating such cost to us based on the estimated percentage of time such personnel were expected to devote to us over the year.  The amount charged under the ISAs is not dependent upon our financial performance.
We believe the cost of the services received under our ISA with Contran, after considering the quality         of the services received, is fair to us and is no less favorable to us than we could otherwise obtain from an unrelated third party for comparable services, based solely on our collective business judgment and experience without performing any         independent market research.
In the early part of each year, Contran's management, including certain of our named executive officers,         estimates the percentage of time that each Contran employee, including our named executive officers, is expected to devote in the upcoming year to Contran and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us.  Contran's management then allocates         Contran's cost of employing each of its employees among Contran and its various subsidiaries and affiliates based on such estimated percentages.  Contran's aggregate cost of employing each of its employees comprises:
- 17 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the annualized base salary of such employee at the beginning of the year;  
· an estimate of the bonus Contran will pay or accrue for such employee (other than bonuses, if any, for specific                    matters) for the year, using as a reasonable approximation for such bonus the actual bonus that Contran paid or accrued for such employee in the prior year; and  
· Contran's portion of the social security and medicare taxes on such base salary and an estimated overhead factor                    (25% for 2018 and 2017, and 23% for 2016) applied to the base salary for the cost of medical and life insurance benefits, unemployment taxes, disability insurance, defined benefit and defined contribution plan benefits, professional                    education and licensing and costs of providing an office, equipment and supplies related to providing such services.  
[END TABLE]
Contran's senior management subsequently made such adjustments to the details of the proposed ISA charge as they deemed         necessary for accuracy, overall reasonableness and fairness to us.
In the first quarter of each year, the proposed charge for that year under our ISA with Contran was         presented to our management development and compensation committee, and the committee considered whether to recommend that our board of directors approve the ISA charge.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the quality of the services Contran provides to us, including the quality of the services our executive officers                    provide to us;  
· the comparison of the ISA charge and number of full-time equivalent employees reflected in the charge by                    department for the prior year and proposed for the current year;  
· the comparison of the prior year and proposed current year charges by department and in total and such amounts as                    a percentage of Contran's similarly calculated costs for its departments and in total for those years;  
· the comparison of the prior year and proposed current year average hourly rate; and  
· the concurrence of our chief financial officer as to the reasonableness of the proposed charge.  
[END TABLE]
In determining whether to recommend that the board of directors approve the proposed ISA fee to be         charged to us, the management development and compensation committee considers the three elements of Contran's cost of employing the personnel who provide services to us, including the cost of employing our named executive officers, in the         aggregate and not individually.  After considering the information contained in such presentations, and following further discussion and review, our management development and compensation committee recommended that our board of directors approve         the proposed ISA fee after concluding that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the cost to employ the personnel necessary to provide the quality of the services provided by Contran would                    exceed the proposed aggregate fee to be charged by Contran to us under our ISA with Contran; and  
· the cost for such services would be no less favorable than could otherwise be obtained from an unrelated third                    party for comparable services in the committee's collective business judgment and experience, without performing any independent market research.  
[END TABLE]
In reaching its recommendation, our management development and compensation committee did not review:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any ISA charge from Contran to any other publicly held parent or sister company, although such charge was                    separately reviewed by the management development and compensation committee of the applicable company; and  
· the compensation policies of Contran or the amount of time our named executive officers are expected to devote to                    us because:  
 o   each of our named executive officers provides services to many companies related to Contran, including Contran                    itself;  
 o   the fee we pay to Contran under our ISA with Contran each year does not represent all of Contran's cost of                    employing each of our named executive officers;  
 o   Contran and these other companies related to Contran absorb the remaining amount of Contran's cost of employing                    each of our named executive officers; and o   the members of our management development and compensation committee consider the other factors discussed above                    in determining whether to recommend that the proposed ISA fee for each year be approved by the full board of directors.  
[END TABLE]
- 18 -
Based on the recommendation of our management development and compensation committee, as well as the         concurrence of our chief financial officer, our independent directors approved the proposed annual ISA charge effective January 1, 2018, with our other directors abstaining.
For financial reporting and income tax purposes, the ISA fee is expensed as incurred on a quarterly         basis.  Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows an income tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation over $1.0 million paid to the company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and three other most highly         compensated executive officers (during 2016 and 2017, the Code contained an exception to such limitation for performance-based compensation).  To the extent any individual's charge to a publicly held company under the ISA was in excess of $1.0         million, the deductibility by the company of the charge for income tax purposes would be limited under Section 162(m), if such section were to be deemed applicable as it relates to the ISA.  In 2016, the Contran ISA did not include charges in         excess of $1.0 million for any individual.  In 2017 and 2018 the ISA did include, and in 2019 the ISA will include, charges in excess of $1.0 million for certain individuals.  However, Contran has agreed to absorb the impact of any such income tax         deduction disallowance resulting from such charges in excess of $1.0 million.
Director              Fees, including Equity-Based Compensation.  Prior to July 2017, we, CompX and Kronos Worldwide each paid director fees in the form of cash and stock compensation to Mr. Graham, who provided services to us pursuant to our ISA with Contran         and who also served on our and their board of directors.  Other than these director fees, we did not pay any compensation directly to Mr. Graham.  Effective July 2017, our executive officers, including our named executive officers, are no longer         eligible to receive cash compensation for their service on the board of directors of us, CompX or Kronos Worldwide.   Beginning in 2018, our executive officers, including our named executive officers, are no longer eligible to receive equity-based         compensation for their services on the board of directors of us, CompX or Kronos Worldwide.
The 2018 Summary Compensation Table sets forth the cash fees that we, CompX and Kronos Worldwide paid to         Mr. Graham for his director services prior to July 2017.  The director fees paid to him were quarterly director retainer fee and fees for attending board meetings.  The cash director fees paid were not dependent upon the financial performance of         any of these companies.
The 2018 Summary Compensation Table sets forth the director stock grants that we, CompX and Kronos         Worldwide paid to Mr. Graham for his director services prior to July 2017.  See footnote 4 to the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for a discussion of the formula by which these stock awards were determined.  The stock grants Mr. Graham received         prior to July 2017 were pursuant to the same formula used for all directors at the time.  The dollar amount of the stock awards appearing in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table represents the value recognized for financial statement reporting         purposes of shares of common stock we, CompX and Kronos Worldwide granted to Mr. Graham for his director services.
Prior to 2016, we decided to forgo the grant of any equity compensation other than annual awards of         stock to our directors, as discussed above.  We also do not have any security ownership requirements or guidelines for our management or directors.  We do not currently anticipate any equity-based compensation will be granted in 2019, other than         the annual grants of stock to our directors who are not employees of Contran or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
Compensation              Committee Report.  The management development and compensation committee has reviewed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in this proxy statement.  Based on the committee's review and a discussion with         management, the committee recommended that our compensation discussion and analysis be included in this proxy statement.
The members of our management development and compensation committee submit the foregoing report as         of February 20, 2019.

 (3)   The amounts shown in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table as salary for each named executive officer include the                    portion of the fees we, CompX and Kronos Worldwide paid to Contran pursuant to certain ISAs with respect to the services such officer rendered to us, our subsidiaries and Kronos Worldwide.  The ISA charges disclosed for Contran employees                    who perform executive officer services to us, our subsidiaries and Kronos Worldwide are based on various factors described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.  Our management development and                    compensation committee considers the factors described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement in determining whether to recommend that our board of directors approve the aggregate proposed ISA fee from                    Contran to us, exclusive of ISA charges from Contran to CompX or Kronos Worldwide.  As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, our management development and compensation committee does not                    consider any ISA charge from Contran to any other publicly held subsidiary, parent or sister company of ours, although such charge is separately reviewed by the management development and compensation committee of the applicable company.                     The amounts shown in the table for salary for Mr. Graham also include director cash compensation paid to him by CompX, Kronos Worldwide and us for his services as a director.  The components of salary shown in the 2018 Summary                    Compensation Table for each of our named executive officers are as follows.

 (a)   Effective July 2017, Mr. Graham, as an employee of Contran, was no longer eligible to receive                    cash compensation for his service on the board of directors of CompX, Kronos Worldwide or us and accordingly his director compensation reflects that he did not receive director compensation after such date.  
 (4)   Stock awards to Mr. Graham in 2016 and 2017 consisted of shares of common stock we, CompX or Kronos Worldwide, as                    applicable, granted to Mr. Graham in each such year for his director services.  Beginning in 2018, Mr. Graham, as an employee of Contran, was no longer eligible for equity-based compensation as a director of us, CompX or Kronos                    Worldwide.  As preapproved by our management development and compensation committee, on the day of each of the 2016 and 2017 annual stockholder meetings, each director elected on that day received a grant of fully-vested shares of our                    common stock under our 2012 Director Stock Plan as determined by a formula based on the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of such meeting, as follows:

We valued these stock awards at the closing price of a share of the common stock on the date of grant,         consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718.
No Grants of Plan-Based Awards.  During 2018, no named executive officer received any plan-based awards from us or our subsidiaries.
No Outstanding Equity Awards at December 31, 2018.  At December 31, 2018, none of our named executive officers held outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our common stock (or common stock of our parent or subsidiary         companies or Kronos Worldwide or its subsidiaries) or held any equity incentive awards for such shares.
No Option Exercises or Stock Vested.  During 2018, no named executive officer exercised any stock options or held any stock subject to vesting restrictions.
Pension Benefits.  We do not have any defined benefit pension plans in which our named executive officers participate.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.  We do not owe any nonqualified deferred compensation to our named executive officers.
Pay Ratio Disclosure  In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted           a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of a registrant's median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of its chief executive officer.  For 2017, the total annual compensation (as disclosed in the 2018           Summary Compensation Table) of Robert D. Graham, our chief executive officer, is $4,887,000; the reasonable estimate of the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees except our chief executive officer, calculated in a manner           consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, is $49,583; and the ratio of such two amounts is 99 to 1.
For purposes of this disclosure, our "median employee" was estimated using a simple random sample         statistical sampling technique, pursuant to which we and each of our consolidated subsidiaries worldwide selected every seventh employee listed on their first payroll register for the month of October 2017.  Based on such random sample of our         employees, and using the 2017 base salary (or equivalent for hourly employees) for each employee in such random sample as reflected in our payroll records, the median employee was estimated by determining the employee in such random sample who had         the median 2017 base salary (or equivalent for hourly employees).  Base salary (or equivalent) amounts were annualized for any employee who had less than a full year of service during 2017.  In determining the median employee, we used the         applicable average exchange rates for the month of October 2017.  There has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since that median employee was identified that we believe would significantly impact our pay         ratio disclosure.  For providing the median employee's annual total compensation in U.S. dollars, we used the applicable average exchange rate for all of 2018.  For this pay ratio disclosure we have used Mr. Graham's total annual compensation for         2018 as disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

Director Compensation.  Our directors who are not employees of Contran or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates are eligible for cash compensation for service as one of our directors.  The table below reflects the         annual rates of their retainers for 2018.
2018 Director Retainers
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Each director      $   25,000    
 Chair of our board      $   50,000    
 Chairman of our audit committee and any member of our audit committee whom the board identified as an "audit committee financial expert"                  (provided that if one person served in both capacities only one such retainer was paid)     $   45,000    
 Other members of our audit committee      $   25,000    
 Members of our other committees      $   5,000    
[END TABLE]
Additionally, our eligible directors receive a fee of $1,000 per day for attendance at meetings of the         board of directors or its committees and an hourly rate (not to exceed $1,000 per day) for other services rendered on behalf of our board of directors or its committees.  If a director dies while serving on our board of directors, his or her         designated beneficiary or estate will be entitled to receive a death benefit equal to the annual retainer then in effect.  We reimburse our directors for reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings and in the performance of other services         rendered on behalf of our board of directors or its committees.
As preapproved by our management development and compensation committee, on the day of         each of our annual shareholder meetings, each of our eligible directors elected on that day receives a grant of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Director Stock Plan with the number of shares received by each eligible director equal in         value to $20,000 (rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares), based on the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, but not more than 10,000 shares.  These shares are fully vested and tradable immediately on their date         of grant, other than restrictions under applicable securities laws.
The following table provides information with respect to compensation each of our directors earned for         their 2018 director services provided to us.

· we do not grant equity awards to                        our employees, officers or other persons who provide services to us under the ISAs with Contran, which mitigates taking excessive or inappropriate                        risk for short-term gain that might be rewarded by equity compensation;

 o   the senior officers employed by CompX or Kronos Worldwide who are responsible for setting the specified                      performance or financial targets or establishing and executing such business plan are not eligible to receive such bonuses based on the business plan, but instead are only eligible for the discretionary-based bonuses described above;                      and o   there exist ceilings for our other                        CompX and Kronos Worldwide key employee bonuses (which are  not a significant part of their compensation) regardless of the actual level of our financial performance achieved;  
· our officers and other persons who                        provide services to us under our ISAs with Contran do not receive compensation from us directly and are employed by Contran, one of our parent corporations, which aligns such officers and persons with the long-term interests of our                        shareholders;  
· since we are a controlled company,                        as previously discussed, management has a strong incentive to understand and perform in the long-term interests of our shareholders; and  
· our experience is that our employees                            are appropriately motivated by our compensation policies and practices to achieve profits and other business objectives in compliance with our oversight of material short and long-term risks.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who         own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership with the SEC, the NYSE and us.  Based solely on the review of the copies of such forms and representations by certain reporting persons, we believe that         for 2018 our executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders complied with all applicable filing requirements under section 16(a).
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS
Related Party Transaction Policy.  From time to time, we engage in transactions with affiliated companies.  Pursuant to our Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions, or RPT Policy, all related         party transactions to which we are or are proposed to be a party are approved or ratified by our audit committee (unless another committee of our board of directors composed solely of independent directors, or all of the independent directors of         our board, shall have approved or ratified the related party transaction).  For certain ongoing related party transactions to which we are a party (referred to as ordinary course of business related party transactions), such approval or         ratification shall occur no less frequently than once a year.  The RPT Policy is available on our website at www.nl-ind.com under the corporate governance section.
During 2018 our audit committee reviewed, adopted and ratified the following ordinary course of         business related party transactions to which we are a party in accordance with the terms of such RPT Policy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Risk Management Program – a program pursuant to which Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related                    entities, including us, as a group purchase third-party insurance policies and risk management services, with the costs thereof apportioned among the participating companies;  
· Tax Sharing Agreement – the cash payments for income taxes periodically paid by us to Valhi or received by us                    from Valhi, as applicable, and related items pursuant to the terms of our tax sharing agreement with Valhi (such tax sharing agreement being appropriate, given that we and our qualifying subsidiaries are members of the consolidated U.S.                    federal income tax return, and certain state and local jurisdiction income tax returns, of which Contran is the parent company); and  
· Data Recovery Program – a program pursuant to which Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities,                    including us, as a group share third-party information technology data recovery services, with the costs thereof apportioned among the participating companies.  
[END TABLE]
Each of these ordinary course of business related party transactions, and the         actions taken by the audit committee in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities under the RPT Policy, are more fully described below.  Our audit committee was not required to approve and ratify the fee we paid to Contran in 2018 under our         intercorporate services agreement with Contran, because such intercorporate services fee is approved by all of the independent directors of our board, as more fully described below.  Our audit committee was also not required to approve and ratify         the secured revolving credit facility with Valhi, which provides for loans by Valhi to NLKW of up to $50 million, because such loan facility was previously approved by all of the independent directors of our board, as more fully described below.          During 2018, we were not a party to any other related party transactions (ordinary course of business related party transactions or otherwise) requiring approval or ratification under the RPT Policy.
Relationships              with Related Parties.  As set forth under the Security Ownership section of this proxy statement, Lisa K. Simmons and Serena Simmons         Connelly may be deemed to control us.  We and other entities that may be deemed to be controlled by or related to Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly sometime engage in the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· intercorporate transactions, such as guarantees, management, expense and insurance sharing arrangements, tax                    sharing agreements, joint ventures, partnerships, loans, options, advances of funds on open account and sales, leases and exchanges of assets, including securities issued by both related and unrelated parties; and  
· common investment and acquisition strategies, business combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations,                    securities repurchases and purchases and sales (and other acquisitions and dispositions) of subsidiaries, divisions or other business units, which transactions have involved both related and unrelated parties and have included                    transactions that resulted in the acquisition by one related party of an equity interest in another related party.  
[END TABLE]
- 26 -
We periodically consider, review and evaluate and understand that Contran and related entities         periodically consider, review and evaluate such transactions.  Depending upon the business, tax and other objectives then relevant and restrictions under indentures and other agreements, it is possible that we might be a party to one or more of         such transactions in the future.  In connection with these activities, we may consider issuing additional equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness.  Our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future include         participation in acquisition or restructuring activities conducted by other companies that may be deemed to be related to Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly.
Certain directors or executive officers of CompX, Contran, Kronos Worldwide or Valhi also serve as our         directors or executive officers.  Such relationships may lead to possible conflicts of interest.  These possible conflicts of interest may arise under circumstances in which such companies may have adverse interests. In such an event, we implement         such procedures as are appropriate for the particular transaction and consistent with the provisions of the RPT Policy.
Intercorporate Services Agreements.  As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, we and         certain related companies have entered into ISAs.  Under the ISAs, employees of one company provide certain services, including executive officer services, to the other company on an annual fixed fee basis.  The services rendered under the ISAs may         include executive, management, financial, internal audit, accounting, tax, legal, insurance, real estate management, environmental management, risk management, treasury, human resources, technical, consulting, administrative, office, occupancy and         other services as required from time to time in the ordinary course of the recipient's business.  The fees paid pursuant to the ISAs are generally based upon an estimated percentage of the time devoted by employees of the provider of the services         to the business of the recipient and the employer's cost related to such employees, which includes the expense for the employees' compensation and an overhead component that takes into account other employment related costs.  Generally, each of the         ISAs renews on a quarterly basis subject to termination by either party pursuant to a written notice delivered 30 days prior to the start of the next quarter.  Because of the number of companies related to Contran and us, we believe we benefit from         cost savings and economies of scale gained by not having certain management, financial, legal, tax, real estate and administrative staffs duplicated at each company, thus allowing certain individuals to provide services to multiple companies.  With         respect to a publicly held company that is a party to an ISA, the ISA and the related aggregate annual charge are approved by the independent directors of the company after receiving the recommendation from the company's management development and         compensation committee as well as the concurrence of the chief financial officer.  See the Intercorporate Services Agreements part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion on the         procedures and considerations taken by our independent directors in approving the aggregate 2018 fee charged to us under our ISA with Contran.
The following table sets forth the fees paid by us, our subsidiaries or Kronos Worldwide to Contran in         2018 and the amount anticipated to be paid to Contran in 2019 for services Contran provided, or will provide, us, our subsidiaries or Kronos Worldwide under the various ISAs, including the services of all of our named executive officers.

 (1)   Prior to 2019, the staff of EWI was employed and compensated directly by EWI.  Beginning January 2019, the staff                    of EWI became employees of Contran and are now compensated directly by Contran for their services.  The ISA fee attributable to us for 2019 in the table above includes an ISA charge to EWI for the services of such individuals ($2.1                    million), and accordingly such 2019 ISA fee is not comparable to our 2018 ISA fee.

Risk Management Program.  We and Contran participate in a combined risk management program.  Pursuant to the program, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities, including us and certain of our         subsidiaries and related entities, as a group, purchase insurance policies and risk management services.  The program apportions its costs among the participating companies.  Tall Pines and EWI provide for or broker the insurance policies.  Tall         Pines purchases reinsurance for substantially all of the risks it underwrites.  EWI also provides claims and risk management services and, where appropriate, engages certain third-party risk management consultants.  Tall Pines is a captive         insurance company wholly owned by Valhi.  EWI is a reinsurance brokerage and risk management company wholly owned by us.  Tall Pines purchases reinsurance from third-party insurance carriers with an A.M. Best Company rating of generally at least an         "A-" (excellent) for substantially all of the risks it underwrites.  Consistent with insurance industry practices, Tall Pines and EWI receive commissions from insurance and reinsurance underwriters and/or assess fees for the policies that they         provide or broker.
With respect to certain of such jointly owned insurance policies, it is possible that unusually large         losses incurred by one or more insureds during a given policy period could leave the other participating companies without adequate coverage under that policy for the balance of the policy period.  As a result, and in the event that the available         coverage under a particular policy would become exhausted by one or more claims, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us, have entered into a loss sharing agreement under which any uninsured loss arising because the         available coverage had been exhausted by one or more claims will be shared ratably amongst those entities that had submitted claims under the relevant policy.  We believe the benefits in the form of reduced premiums and broader coverage associated         with the group coverage for such policies justify the risk associated with the potential for any uninsured loss.
During 2018, we, CompX and Kronos Worldwide paid Tall Pines and EWI in the aggregate approximately $12.6         million, including approximately $2.3 million paid by Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., a partnership of which a wholly owned subsidiary of Kronos Worldwide and a subsidiary of Venator Materials PLC each owns 50%.  These amounts principally         represent payments for insurance premiums, including premiums or fees paid to Tall Pines and commissions or fees paid to EWI.  These amounts also include payments to insurers or reinsurers through EWI for the reimbursement of claims within our         applicable deductible or retention ranges that such insurers and reinsurers paid to third parties on our behalf, as well as amounts for claims and risk management services and various other third-party fees and expenses incurred by the program.  We         expect these relationships with Tall Pines and EWI will continue in 2019.
In October 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our participation         in the combined risk management program.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the premiums for all of the insurance and reinsurance policies are set by third parties (the underwriters for the                    insurance or reinsurance carriers bearing the risk), without any markup by Tall Pines or EWI;  
· the method by which the insurance premiums are allocated among the companies participating in the risk management                    program is generally the same as the basis used by the insurance or reinsurance carriers to establish the premiums for such insurance/reinsurance (i.e. the dominant premium factor, which is the factor that has the greatest impact on the premium, such as revenues, payroll or employee headcount);  
· EWI provides claims and risk management services to each of the companies participating in the risk management                    program, including us, and where appropriate EWI engages third-party risk management consultants;  
· the commissions received by Tall Pines and EWI from the insurance or reinsurance underwriters, and the fees                    assessed for the policies they so provide or broker, are in amounts equal to the commissions or fees which would be received by third-party brokers or underwriters;  
· the insurance coverages provided to us by the risk management program are sufficient and adequate for our                    purposes;  
· the benefits to our participating in the risk management program include, among others, (a) the ability to obtain                    broader coverage, with strong/solvent underwriters, at a reduced cost as compared to the coverage and cost that would be available if we were to purchase insurance by itself, (b) the greater spread of risk among the companies                    participating in the risk management program, (c) the ability to obtain centralized premium and claim reporting, and (d) the ability to have access to the experienced risk management personnel of EWI, including in the areas of loss                    controls and claims processing; and  
· the "cost of risk" metric, as defined by the Risk and Insurance Management Society, or RIMS, for the Contran                    group is lower as compared to the cost of risk as reflected in a recent RIMS benchmark survey for certain groups of companies comparable to the Contran group.  
[END TABLE]
- 28 -
As part of such presentations, our chief financial officer, after consultation with other members of our         management, advised the committee of his belief that our participation in the risk management program, including the allocation of its costs among us and the other entities participating in the risk management program, is fair and reasonable to us,         and is on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, and provided the committee with his recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify our participation in the risk management program in all         respects.
After considering the information contained in the presentations, including the recommendation of our         chief financial officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that our participation in the risk management program is fair and reasonable to us, and is on terms no less favorable than         we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified our participation in the risk management program         in all respects.
During 2018, the audit committees of Kronos Worldwide and CompX approved and ratified their         participation in the risk management program in accordance with the terms of their own RPT Polices.
Tax Matters.  We and our qualifying subsidiaries are members of the consolidated U.S. federal tax return of which Contran is the parent company, which we refer to as the "Contran Tax Group."  We are also a party to a         tax sharing agreement with Contran and Valhi.  As a member of the Contran Tax Group and pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, we and our qualifying subsidiaries compute our provision for U.S. income taxes on a separate company basis using tax         elections made by Contran.  Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and using tax elections made by Contran, we make payments to or receive payments from Valhi in amounts we would have paid to or received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service had we         not been a member of the Contran Tax Group but instead had been a separate taxpayer.  Refunds are limited to amounts previously paid under the tax sharing agreement.  We and our qualifying subsidiaries are also a part of consolidated tax returns         filed by Contran in certain U.S. state jurisdictions, and the terms of the tax sharing agreement also apply to state payments to these jurisdictions.
Under applicable law, we, as well as every other member of the Contran Tax Group, are each jointly and         severally liable for the aggregate federal income tax liability of Contran and the other companies included in the group for all periods in which we are included in the group.  Under our tax sharing agreement with Valhi, Valhi agrees to indemnify         us for any liability for income taxes of the Contran Tax Group in excess of our tax liability previously computed and paid by us in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.
Under certain circumstances, tax regulations could require Contran to treat items differently than we         would have treated them on a stand-alone basis.  In such instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to conform to Contran's tax elections.  For 2018, and pursuant to our tax sharing agreement, we         received a net cash payment for income taxes from Valhi of approximately $1.7 million and pursuant to Kronos Worldwide's tax sharing agreement Kronos Worldwide received a net cash payment for income taxes from Valhi of approximately $1.9 million.
In February 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our tax sharing         agreement with Contran and Valhi.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the tax sharing agreement is consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of                    America, and consistent with applicable law and regulations; and  
· our income tax accounts are included in the scope of the annual audit of our consolidated financial statements                    performed by PwC, and PwC makes periodic reports to the committee regarding income tax matters related to us.  
[END TABLE]

As part of such presentation, our chief financial officer and our chief tax officer advised the         committee of their belief that the terms of the tax sharing agreement are consistent with the terms of applicable law and regulations, and are fair and reasonable to us, and are on terms no less favorable than would be present if we were not a         party to the tax sharing agreement, and provided the committee with their recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify the tax sharing agreement in all respects.
After considering the information contained in the presentation, including the recommendation of our         chief financial officer and our chief tax officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that the terms of the tax sharing agreement are fair and reasonable to us and on terms no less         favorable than would be present if we were not a party to the tax sharing agreement, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified the tax sharing         agreement in all respects.
During 2018, Kronos Worldwide's audit committee approved and ratified Kronos Worldwide's tax sharing         agreement with Valhi and Contran in accordance with the terms of Kronos Worldwide's RPT Policy.
Related           Party Loans for Cash Management Purposes.  From time to time, loans and advances are made between us and various related parties pursuant to term and demand notes.  These loans and advances are entered into principally for cash management         purposes pursuant to our cash management program.  When we loan funds to related parties, we are generally able to earn a higher rate of return on the loan than we would earn if the funds were invested in other instruments.  While certain of such         loans may be of a lesser credit quality than cash equivalent instruments otherwise available to us, we believe that we have evaluated the credit risks involved, and that those risks are reasonable and reflected in the terms of the applicable         loans.  When we have outstanding indebtedness, we may still decide to enter into a loan to a related party either because the interest rate on the loan to the related party is at a higher rate of return as compared to the interest rate we are         paying on our outstanding indebtedness, or the funds we would be loaning to the related party would not otherwise be used to paydown the outstanding indebtedness (such as, for example, in the case when the outstanding indebtedness has a maturity         longer than the maturity of the loan to the related party).  When we borrow from related parties, we are generally able to pay a lower rate of interest than we would pay if we borrowed from unrelated parties.
During 2018, Kronos Worldwide had an unsecured revolving promissory note with Valhi whereby Kronos         Worldwide agreed to loan Valhi up to $60 million.  Kronos Worldwide's loan to Valhi, as amended, bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.00%, payable quarterly and all principal and unpaid interest due on demand, but in any event no earlier than         December 31, 2020.  The agreement contains no financial covenants or other financial restrictions. Loans made to Valhi at any time under the agreement are at Kronos Worldwide's discretion.  During 2018, Kronos Worldwide made aggregate loans to         Valhi of $2.6 million, Valhi repaid an aggregate of $16.2 million, and the largest amount of principal outstanding under the loan was $14.4 million.  At December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance of such loan to Valhi.  During 2018, Kronos         received aggregate interest under this note (including unused commitment fees) of approximately $0.3 million.  During 2018, Kronos Worldwide's audit committee approved and ratified its loan to Valhi in accordance with the terms of its own RPT         Policy.
During 2018, CompX had an unsecured revolving promissory note with Valhi whereby CompX agreed to loan         Valhi up to $40 million.  CompX's loan to Valhi, as amended, bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.00%, payable quarterly and all principal and unpaid interest due on demand, but in any event no earlier than December 31, 2020.  The agreement         contains no financial covenants or other financial restrictions. Loans made to Valhi at any time under the agreement are at CompX's discretion.  During 2018, CompX made aggregate loans to Valhi of $46.8 million, Valhi repaid an aggregate of $51.0         million, and the largest amount of principal outstanding under the loan was $40.0 million. At December 30, 2018 (the last day of CompX's 2018 fiscal year), the outstanding balance of such loan to Valhi was $34.0 million.  On December 31, 2018 (one         day after the end of CompX's fiscal year-end, but on the last day of the fiscal year for Valhi), CompX loaned $6.0 million to Valhi, increasing the outstanding principal balance receivable from Valhi under the promissory note to $40.0 million.          During 2018, CompX received aggregate interest under this note (including unused commitment fees) of $2.1 million.  During 2018, CompX's audit committee approved and ratified its loan to Valhi in accordance with the terms of its own RPT Policy.

Secured Loan from Valhi .  In November 2016, we entered into a financing transaction with Valhi.  Previously, and in contemplation of the financing transaction described herein, we formed NLKW and capitalized it with         35.2 million shares of the common stock of Kronos held by us.
The financing transaction consisted of two steps.  Under the first step, NLKW entered into a $50 million         revolving credit facility (the "Valhi Credit Facility") pursuant to which NLKW can borrow up to $50 million from Valhi (with such commitment amount subject to increase from time to time in Valhi's sole discretion).  Proceeds from any borrowings by         NLKW under the Valhi Credit Facility would be available for one or more loans from NLKW to us in accordance with the terms of the second step of the financing transaction:  a Back-to-Back Credit Facility, as described below.  Outstanding borrowings         under the Valhi Credit Facility bear interest at the prime rate plus 1.875% per annum, payable quarterly, with all amounts due on December 31, 2023.  The maximum principal amount which may be outstanding from time-to-time under the Valhi Credit         Facility is limited to 50% of the amount determined by multiplying the number of shares of Kronos common stock pledged by the most recent closing price of such security on the New York Stock Exchange.  Borrowings under the Valhi Credit Facility are         collateralized by the assets of NLKW (consisting primarily of the shares of Kronos common stock pledged), and 100% of the membership interest in NLKW held by us.  The Valhi Credit Facility contains a number of covenants and restrictions which,         among other things, restrict NLKW's ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, and merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer substantially all of NLKW's assets to, another entity, and require NLKW to maintain a minimum specified level of         consolidated net worth.  Upon an event of default, Valhi will be entitled to terminate its commitment to make further loans to NLKW, to declare the outstanding loans (with interest) immediately due and payable, and, in the case of certain         insolvency events with respect to NLKW or us, to exercise its rights with respect to the collateral. Such collateral rights include the right to purchase all of the shares of Kronos common stock pledged at a purchase price equal to the aggregate         market value of such stock (with such market value determined by an independent third-party valuation provider), less amounts owing to Valhi under the Valhi Credit         Facility, with up to 50% of such purchase price being payable by Valhi in the form of an unsecured promissory note bearing interest at the prime rate plus 2.75% per annum, payable quarterly, with all amounts due no later than five years from the         date of purchase, and with the remainder of such purchase price payable in cash at the date of purchase.
Contemporaneously with the entering into of the Valhi Credit Facility, NLKW entered into a $50 million revolving credit         facility (the "Back-to-Back Credit Facility") with us, pursuant to which we can borrow up to $50 million from NLKW (with such commitment amount         subject to increase from time to time in NLKW's sole discretion).  Proceeds from any borrowings under the Back-to-Back Credit Facility would be available for our general corporate purposes.  Outstanding borrowings under the Back-to-Back Credit         Facility bear interest at the same rate and are payable on the same maturity date as are borrowings by NLKW under the Valhi Credit Facility.  Borrowings under the Back-to-Back Credit Facility are on an unsecured basis; however, as a condition         thereto, we pledged to Valhi as collateral for the Valhi Credit Facility our 100% membership interest in NLKW.  Any outstanding borrowings under the Back-to-Back Credit Facility are eliminated in the preparation of our consolidated financial         statements.
There were no borrowings or repayments under the Valhi Credit Facility during 2018, and the outstanding         loan balance at December 31, 2018 was $0.5 million.  During 2018, we paid an aggregate of approximately $37,000 of interest to Valhi under the facility.  In November 2016, our independent directors approved the Valhi Credit Facility, with our other         directors abstaining.  The process by which our independent directors approved the Valhi Credit Facility is more fully described in the Certain Relationships and Transactions section of our 2017 proxy statement.
Data Recovery Program.  We and Contran participate in a combined information technology data recovery program that Contran provides from a data recovery center that it established.  Pursuant to the program, Contran and         certain of its subsidiaries and related entities, including us, as a group share information technology data recovery services.  The program apportions its costs among the participating companies.  Kronos Worldwide and EWI paid Contran $277,000 and         $35,000, respectively, for such services in 2018.  We expect that the relationship between Kronos Worldwide and Contran with respect to these matters will continue in 2019.
In February 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our participation         in the combined data recovery program.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
- 31 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The third-party cost of the data recovery program is passed through to the companies participating in the data                    recovery program, including us, without markup;  
· Such third-party cost is allocated to the companies participating in the data recovery program, including us,                    based on the number of information technology data racks used by each of the companies participating in the data recovery program;  
· The back-up site made available to us under the data recovery program is sufficient and adequate for our                    purposes; and  
· The benefits to our participating in the data recovery program include, among others, the ability to share in the                    cost of a third-party, off-site data recovery center at a reduced cost as compared to the cost to be incurred if we were to obtain a third-party, off-site data recovery center by ourselves, as well as the shared administration of the                    third-party, off-site data recovery center as compared to the cost of administering such a site by ourselves.  
[END TABLE]
As part of such presentation, our chief financial officer, after consultation with other members of our         management, advised the committee of his belief that our participation in the data recovery program, including the allocation of its costs among us and the other entities participating in the data recovery program, is fair and reasonable to us, and         is on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, and provided the committee with his recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify our participation in the data recovery program in all respects.
After considering the information contained in the presentation, including the recommendation of our         chief financial officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that our participation in the data recovery program is fair and reasonable to us, and is on terms no less favorable than we         could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified our participation in the data recovery program in all         respects.
During 2018, Kronos Worldwide's audit committee approved and ratified Kronos Worldwide's participation         in the data recovery program in accordance with the terms of its own RPT Policy.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Our audit committee of the board of directors is composed of five directors and operates under a written         charter adopted by the board of directors.  All members of our audit committee meet the independence standards established by the board of directors and the NYSE and promulgated by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Three members of our         audit committee meet the audit committee financial expert requirements under the applicable SEC rules.  The audit committee charter is available on our website at www.nl-ind.com under            the corporate governance section, and our audit committee reviews the adequacy of and compliance with such charter annually.
Our management is responsible for, among other things, preparing our consolidated financial statements         in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or "GAAP," establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) and evaluating the         effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and for expressing         an opinion on the conformity of the financial statements with GAAP.
Our audit committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee         management's implementation of our financial reporting process and the audits of our consolidated financial statements.  Our audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent         registered public accounting firm.  As part of fulfilling this responsibility, our audit committee engages in an annual evaluation of, among other things, the firm's qualifications, competence, integrity, expertise, performance, independence and         communications with the committee (including these factors as they relate specifically to the firm's lead audit engagement partner), and whether the current firm should be retained for the upcoming year's audit.  Our audit committee discusses with         our independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for the audit they will perform, and the committee meets with the firm throughout the year, both with and without management being present, to monitor the firm's         execution of and results obtained from their audit.  Our audit committee performs other activities throughout the year, in accordance with the responsibilities of the audit committee specified in the audit committee charter, including the approval         or ratification of certain related party transactions in accordance with the terms of our RPT Policy, as discussed above in the Certain Relationships and Transactions section in this proxy statement.
In its oversight role, our audit committee reviewed and discussed our audited consolidated financial         statements with management and with PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for 2018.  Our audit committee also reviewed and discussed our internal control over financial reporting with management and with PwC. Management and PwC         indicated that our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP.  Our audit committee discussed with PwC and management the significant accounting policies used and         significant estimates made by management in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements, and the overall quality of management's financial reporting process.  Our audit committee and PwC also discussed any issues deemed         significant by PwC or the committee, including the matters required to be discussed pursuant to the standards of the PCAOB, the rules of the SEC and other applicable regulations.  PwC has provided to our audit committee written disclosures and the         letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and our audit committee discussed with PwC the firm's         independence.  Our audit committee also concluded that PwC's provision of other permitted non-audit services to us and our related entities is compatible with PwC's independence.
Based upon the foregoing considerations, our audit committee recommended to the board of directors that         our audited consolidated financial statements be included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC.
The members of our audit committee submit the foregoing report as of March 11, 2019.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM MATTERS
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.  PwC served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Our audit committee has appointed PwC to review         our quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to be included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for the first quarter of 2019.  We expect PwC will be considered for appointment to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· review our quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to be included in our Quarterly Reports                    on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020; and  
· audit our annual consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the year                    ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Representatives of PwC are not expected to attend our 2019 annual shareholder meeting.
Fees Paid           to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  The following table shows the aggregate fees that PwC has billed or is expected to bill to us, CompX or Kronos Worldwide for services rendered for 2017 and 2018 that our audit committee authorized for us and         our privately held subsidiaries and the CompX or Kronos Worldwide audit committees each separately authorized for its corporation and such corporation's privately held subsidiaries.  Additional fees for 2018 may subsequently be authorized and paid         to PwC, in which case the amounts disclosed below for fees paid to PwC for 2018 would be adjusted to reflect such additional payments in our proxy statement relating to next year's annual shareholder meeting.  In this regard, we have similarly         adjusted the audit fees shown for 2017 from the amounts disclosed in our 2018 proxy statement.

Preapproval Policies and Procedures.  For the purpose of maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, our audit committee has adopted policies and procedures for the preapproval of         audit and other permitted services the firm provides to us or any of our subsidiaries other than CompX and Kronos Worldwide and their respective subsidiaries.  We may not engage the firm to render any audit or other permitted service unless the         service is approved in advance by our audit committee pursuant to the committee's preapproval policy.  Pursuant to the policy:
- 34 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the committee must specifically preapprove, among other things, the engagement of our independent registered                    public accounting firm for audits and quarterly reviews of our financial statements, services associated with certain regulatory filings, including the filing of registration statements with the SEC, and services associated with potential                    business acquisitions and dispositions involving us; and  
· for certain categories of other                      permitted services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm, the committee may preapprove limits on the aggregate fees in any calendar year without specific approval of the service.  
[END TABLE]
These other permitted services include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· audit-related services, such as certain consultations regarding accounting treatments or interpretations and                    assistance in responding to certain SEC comment letters;  
· audit-related services, such as certain other consultations regarding accounting treatments or interpretations,                    employee benefit plan audits, due diligence and control reviews;  
· tax services, such as tax compliance and consulting, transfer pricing, customs and duties and expatriate tax                    services; and  
· assistance with corporate governance matters and filing documents in foreign jurisdictions not involving the                    practice of law.  
[END TABLE]
The policy also lists certain services for which the independent auditor is always prohibited from providing us under         applicable requirements of the SEC or the PCAOB.
Pursuant to the policy, our audit committee has delegated preapproval authority to the chairman of the         committee or his designee to approve any fees in excess of the annual preapproved limits for these categories of other permitted services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.  The chairman must report any action taken         pursuant to this delegated authority at the next meeting of the committee.
For 2018, our audit committee preapproved all of PwC's services provided to us or any of our         subsidiaries, other than CompX and Kronos Worldwide and their subsidiaries, in compliance with our preapproval policy without the use of the SEC's de           minimis exception to such preapproval requirement.

PROPOSAL 2
NONBINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
Background.  Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, a publicly held company is         required to submit to its shareholders a nonbinding advisory vote to approve the compensation of its named executive officers, commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal.  At our 2018 Annual Meeting our shareholders approved, on a nonbinding         advisory basis, an annual Say-on-Pay.  The next nonbinding shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of a Say-on-Pay proposal will be at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Say-on-Pay Proposal.  This proposal affords our shareholders the opportunity to submit a nonbinding advisory vote on our named executive           officer compensation.  The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the tabular disclosure regarding our named executive officer compensation and the           related disclosure in this proxy statement describe our named executive officer compensation and the compensation decisions made by our management and our management development and compensation committee of the board of directors with respect to           our named executive officers.  This proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement, but the compensation of our named executive officers in general.            Our board of directors requests that each shareholder cast a nonbinding advisory vote to adopt the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that, by the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the 2019 annual shareholder meeting and entitled to vote on the         subject matter, the shareholders of NL Industries, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the compensation of its executive officers named in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in the 2019 annual meeting proxy statement of NL Industries,         Inc. as such compensation is disclosed in the proxy statement pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which disclosure includes the compensation discussion and analysis, the         compensation tables and any related disclosure in the proxy statement.
Effect of the Proposal.  The Say-on-Pay proposal is nonbinding and advisory.  Our shareholders' approval or disapproval of this proposal will           not require our board of directors, its management development and compensation committee or our management to take any action regarding our executive compensation practices.
Vote Required.  Because this proposal is a nonbinding advisory vote, there is no minimum requisite vote to approve the Say-on-Pay         proposal.  The proposed resolution provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at           the 2019 annual shareholder meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the requisite vote to adopt the resolution and approve the compensation of our named executive officers as such compensation is disclosed in this proxy           statement.  Accordingly, abstentions will be counted as represented and entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.  Broker/nominee non-votes will have no effect on this proposal.
Valhi has indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the meeting and         to vote such shares FOR the Say-on-Pay proposal and adoption of the resolution that approves the compensation of our named executive officers as         described in this proxy statement.  If Valhi attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the meeting will have a quorum present and the         shareholders will adopt the resolution and approve the nonbinding advisory Say-on-Pay proposal.
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE SAY-ON-PAY PROPOSAL AS SET FORTH IN THE NONBINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION APPROVING OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
