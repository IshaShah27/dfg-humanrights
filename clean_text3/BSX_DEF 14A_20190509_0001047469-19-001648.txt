Dear Boston Scientific Stockholder: 
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) to be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the Company's Corporate Headquarters located at 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752 (Annual Meeting). 
This year you are being asked to: 
These matters are more fully described in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement. Our Board of Directors urges you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement and recommends that you vote "FOR" all of the director nominees, the named executive officer compensation, the amendment and restatement of our By-Laws, and the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. At the meeting, you will be provided with the opportunity to ask questions. 
We are pleased to continue to take advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commission rule allowing companies to furnish proxy materials to their stockholders via the Internet. We believe this e-proxy process, also known as "notice and access," expedites stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lowers our printing and mailing costs, and reduces the environmental impact of producing the materials for our Annual Meeting. On or about March 27, 2019, we will mail to our stockholders of record at the close of business on Friday, March 15, 2019, the record date for our Annual Meeting, an Important Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice) containing instructions on how to access our Proxy Statement and Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (Annual Report) on the Internet and also how to vote their shares via the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail, you will not receive printed proxy materials unless you specifically request them. Both the Notice and the Proxy Statement contain instructions on how you can request a paper copy of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report. 
The Board of Directors appreciates and encourages stockholder participation in the Company's affairs. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares. Accordingly, we request that as soon as possible, you vote via the Internet or, if you have received printed proxy materials, you vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing your completed proxy card or voter instruction form. 
Thank you for your continuing support.

   The Annual Meeting   
[END TABLE]
The Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation (Annual Meeting) will be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the Company's Corporate Headquarters located at 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752. At this meeting, stockholders will be asked to elect ten nominees for director, approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, named executive officer compensation, approve an amendment and restatement of our By-Laws to provide for a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections, and ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Management will also report on our performance during 2018 and will respond to questions from stockholders. Our principal executive offices are located at 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752, and our telephone number is (508) 683-4000. When used in this Proxy Statement, the terms "we," "us," "our," "Boston Scientific" and "the Company" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its businesses and subsidiaries. 
   Why am I receiving these materials?  
In connection with its solicitation of proxies for use at our Annual Meeting, our Board of Directors (Board) (i) has made these materials available to you via the Internet or, upon your request, via email, or (ii) upon your request, has delivered or will deliver printed versions of these materials to you by mail. As a stockholder of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 15, 2019, the record date for our Annual Meeting, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, and are entitled to and requested to vote on the items of business described in this Proxy Statement. 
   Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of printed proxy materials?  
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (Annual Report and, together with this Proxy Statement, the proxy materials) available to stockholders electronically via the Internet. Stockholders will be able to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Important Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice) or request to receive printed copies of the proxy materials and a proxy card. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials via the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice and in this Proxy Statement. We  Table of Contents believe that this electronic process expedites your receipt of the proxy materials and reduces the cost and environmental impact of printing proxy materials for our Annual Meeting. 
On or about March 27, 2019, stockholders of record and beneficial owners of our common stock at the close of business on March 15, 2019 will be sent a Notice instructing them as to how to receive their proxy materials via the Internet. The proxy materials will be available on the Internet as of March 27, 2019. 
   How can I electronically access the proxy materials?  
Beginning March 27, 2019, you can access the proxy materials and vote your shares online at  www.proxyvote.com. The proxy materials are also available on our own website (www.bostonscientific.com). 
   How can I obtain a full set of printed proxy materials?  
If you prefer to receive paper copies of the proxy materials and a proxy card, you may still do so. You may request printed materials by (i) calling (800) 579-1639; (ii) sending an email to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com; or (iii) logging onto  www.proxyvote.com using the credentials provided on your Notice or proxy card. 
   Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
Stockholders who held shares of our common stock at the close of business on Friday, March 15, 2019, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote. 
   How many shares are eligible to be voted and how many shares are required to hold the Annual Meeting?  
A quorum is required to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of our common stock outstanding as of the close of business on Friday, March 15, 2019, the record date, will constitute a quorum for purposes of holding and conducting business at the Annual Meeting. As of March 15, 2019, we had 1,390,499,842 shares of our common stock outstanding — each entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting — meaning that 695,249,922 shares of common stock must be represented in person or by proxy to have a quorum. Our common stock is our only outstanding class of voting securities. For purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, broker non-votes (as described further below) and proxies received but marked "ABSTAIN" will be counted. 
   What am I voting on?  
You are voting on proposals to:  Table of Contents
   How does the Board recommend that I vote?  
The Board recommends that you vote: 
   How do I vote by proxy?  
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you may give a proxy to be voted at the Annual Meeting either:
If you vote by mail, no postage is required if your proxy card is mailed in the United States. If you properly vote pursuant to the instructions provided in the Notice or properly complete and deliver your proxy card (whether electronically, by mail or by telephone) and our Inspector of Election receives your instructions in time to vote at the Annual Meeting, your "proxy" (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares as you have directed. If you sign and return your proxy card, but do not make specific selections, your proxy will vote your shares as recommended by the Board. If any other matter is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, including a proposal to postpone or adjourn the meeting, your proxy will vote your shares in accordance with his or her discretion. At present, the Board knows of no other business that is intended to be brought before or acted upon at the Annual Meeting.
   What if I need assistance with voting or have questions regarding the Annual Meeting?  
If you need assistance voting your shares or have questions regarding the Annual Meeting, please contact our proxy solicitation advisor:

   How are votes counted?  
In the election of directors, your vote may be cast "FOR" one or more of the nominees or your vote may be "WITHHELD" with respect to one or more of the nominees. If you sign your proxy card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. 
In the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation, your vote may be cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" or you may "ABSTAIN." If you "ABSTAIN," it will not count as a share actually voted and will have no effect on the determination of this proposal. If you sign your proxy card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. 
In the proposal on an amendment and restatement of our By-Laws to provide for a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections, your vote may be cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" or you may "ABSTAIN." If you "ABSTAIN," it will not count as a share actually voted with respect to determining if a required vote is obtained under our By-Laws but will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST this proposal. If you sign your proxy card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. 
In the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, your vote may be cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" or you may "ABSTAIN." If you "ABSTAIN," it will not count as a share actually voted and will have no effect on the determination of this proposal. If you sign your proxy card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. 
   How many votes are required to approve each proposal?   Table of Contents
At present, the Board knows of no other matters to be presented for stockholder action at the Annual Meeting. 
   What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?  
Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, trustee, bank, other financial intermediary or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between stockholders of record and beneficial owners. 
   Stockholders of Record  
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner Services, as of the close of business on Friday, March 15, 2019, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice or proxy materials are being made available, electronically or otherwise, directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or a third party, or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. The Company has made available a proxy card or electronic voting means for you to use for voting purposes. 
   Beneficial Owners  
If your shares are held through a brokerage firm, trustee, bank, other financial intermediary or other nominee, as of the close of business on Friday, March 15, 2019, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares held in street name, and the Notice or proxy materials are being made available, electronically or otherwise, by the Company to your broker, trustee, bank, other financial intermediary or other nominee (the intermediary) and they will forward these materials to you, together with a voting instruction form if furnished via paper copy to your intermediary. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your intermediary on how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting; however, since you are not the  stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting, unless you request, complete and deliver a legal proxy from your intermediary. If you requested printed proxy materials, your intermediary will enclose a voting instruction form for you to use in directing the intermediary regarding how to vote your shares.  Table of Contents
   What discretion does my broker have to vote my shares held in "street name?"  
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules allow your broker to vote your shares in its discretion on "routine" proposals when it has not received instructions from you at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting. The proposal regarding the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is a matter considered routine under applicable rules and, therefore, your broker may vote on your behalf for this matter if you do not otherwise provide instructions. The election of directors, the vote to approve an amendment and restatement of our By-Laws to provide for a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections and the advisory vote on the named executive officer compensation are not considered routine matters. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote your shares on the non-routine matters, your broker will not be permitted to vote your shares on such matters. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
Broker non-votes (shares held by brokers that do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and that have not received voting instructions from their clients) are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but are not counted or deemed to be present, represented or voted for the purpose of determining whether stockholders have approved a proposal. A broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors or the advisory vote on the named executive officer compensation, but will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to approve the amendment and restatement of our By-Laws to provide for a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections. 
   How do I vote my 401(k) shares?  
If you participate in our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, as amended and restated (401(k) Plan), you will receive a single proxy card (together with the proxy materials) or Notice that covers all shares credited to your plan account(s) and shares that you own of record that are registered in the same name. If your plan account(s) are registered in different names, you will receive separate proxy cards or Notices for your record and plan holdings. You may vote your shares by following the instructions provided in your proxy card or Notice and utilizing the credentials provided therein. Your vote will serve to instruct the trustees and fiduciaries of our 401(k) Plan how to vote any shares of our common stock held in our 401(k) Plan on your behalf. Shares of our common stock held in our 401(k) Plan must be voted on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 4, 2019. The trustee and fiduciaries of our 401(k) Plan will vote shares for which timely instructions are not received in the same proportion as other plan shares that were voted. 
   What happens if I don't specify how I want my shares voted on one or all of the proposals?  
If you are the stockholder of record and you sign, date and return your proxy and do not mark how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote "FOR" all of the nominees for directors, "FOR" the named executive officer compensation, "FOR" the amendment and restatement of our By-Laws and "FOR" the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young. If you hold your shares in street name, please see the discussion on "What discretion does my broker have to vote my shares held in 'street name?'," above.  Table of Contents
   Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have already voted or given my proxy?  
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before the proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting. To change your vote, you may:
Your last dated proxy, properly completed and timely received prior to, or vote cast at, the Annual Meeting will be counted. 
If you own your shares in street name, please contact your broker or other intermediary for instructions on changing your vote or revoking your proxy. 
   Can I vote in person at the meeting?  
Yes. If you are the stockholder of record of the shares, you can vote in person by coming to the Annual Meeting, and we will give you a ballot or a new proxy card when you arrive with proper identification. However, since a beneficial owner holding shares in street name is not the stockholder of record, if you are such a beneficial owner of shares, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker or other intermediary that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. Please bring the legal proxy with you to the Annual Meeting. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you must provide proper identification. Please visit our website,  www.bostonscientific.com, for directions to the Annual Meeting. 
   Who will count the votes?  
Broadridge has been engaged as our independent agent to tabulate stockholder votes and act as Inspector of Election for the meeting. 
   Is voting confidential?  
Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within the Company or to third parties, except: Table of Contents
Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to the Company's management and the Board. 
   What happens if the Annual Meeting is adjourned or postponed?  
Your proxy will still be effective and will be voted at the rescheduled Annual Meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted, provided such new proxy or revocation is properly completed and timely received. 
   Will any other business be considered or presented at the Annual Meeting?  
Our By-Laws provide that a stockholder may present business to be considered at the Annual Meeting only if proper prior written notice was timely received by us. Other than the items of business described in this Proxy Statement, our Board is not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting; however, if any other business does properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your shares in accordance with their discretion. 
   How can I find the results of the Annual Meeting?  
We will report the final voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. The Form 8-K will be available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov, as well as on our own website,  www.bostonscientific.com, under the "Investor Relations" section. 
   Who is soliciting my vote pursuant to this Proxy Statement?  
Our Board is soliciting your vote. 
   Is there a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and for ten days prior to the Annual Meeting, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, at our Corporate Headquarters located at 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752. If you would like to view the stockholder list, please contact our Corporate Secretary to schedule an appointment by calling (508) 683-4000 or writing to her at 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752.  Table of Contents 
  Internet Availability of Proxy Materials     
Under rules adopted by the SEC, we are furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders primarily via the Internet instead of mailing printed copies of those materials to each stockholder. On or about March 27, 2019, we will mail to our stockholders (other than those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) an Important Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials, including our Proxy Statement and our Annual Report. The Notice also instructs stockholders on how to vote via the Internet. 
This process is designed to expedite stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the cost of the Annual Meeting and help conserve natural resources; however, if you would prefer to receive printed proxy materials and a proxy card, please follow the instructions included in the Notice and in this Proxy Statement. If you have previously elected to receive our proxy materials electronically, these materials will continue to be made available to you via email until you elect otherwise. If you have previously elected to receive printed proxy materials, you will continue to receive these materials and a proxy card in paper format until you elect otherwise.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like "anticipate," "expect," "project," "believe," "plan," "may," "estimate," "intend" and other similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and estimates using information available to us at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance.

  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS     
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Summary   
[END TABLE]
Our entire Board is elected annually by our stockholders and currently consists of ten members. All of our current directors have been nominated by our Board, upon the recommendation of our Nominating and Governance Committee, to stand for election at the Annual Meeting for a one-year term, to hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. The nominees for election at the Annual Meeting are: Nelda J. Connors, Charles J. Dockendorff, Yoshiaki Fujimori, Donna A. James, Edward J. Ludwig, Stephen P. MacMillan, Michael F. Mahoney, David J. Roux, John E. Sununu and Ellen M. Zane. 
Each of the director nominees is willing and able to stand for election at the Annual Meeting, and we know of no reason why any of the nominees would be unable to serve as a director. Should such a situation arise, however, the Board may designate a substitute nominee or, alternatively, reduce the number of directors to be elected. If a substitute nominee is selected, the persons named as proxies will vote for that substitute nominee. Any vacancies not filled at the Annual Meeting may be filled by the Board.

  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF ALL TEN OF THESE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR.      Table of Contents 
  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE     
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Overview   
[END TABLE]
To guide the operation and direction of the Board and its committees, our Board has established our Corporate Governance Guidelines, charters for its standing committees and our Code of Conduct to reflect our commitment to good corporate governance and to comply with Delaware law, the rules and listing standards of the NYSE, the rules and regulations of the SEC and other legal requirements. These materials are available under "Governance Overview" in the "Investor Relations" section of our website at www.bostonscientific.com. These materials are also available in print free of charge to stockholders, upon written request to Boston Scientific Corporation, Investor Relations, 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752. 
Our Board believes that good corporate governance is fundamental to the overall success of our business. To that end, our Board evaluates our corporate governance practices in light of applicable changes in Delaware law, the rules and listing standards of the NYSE, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the rules and regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities, and makes modifications to our corporate governance practices that it determines are warranted. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Director Independence   
[END TABLE]
Under the NYSE's Corporate Governance Standards, a majority of the Board must qualify as independent directors. However, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a significant majority of the Board qualify as independent directors. The NYSE Corporate Governance Standards define specific relationships that disqualify directors from being independent and further require that for a director to qualify as independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with our Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company). 
In making determinations regarding independence, the Board applies the NYSE standards and broadly considers all relevant facts and circumstances known to it. For directors who will serve on the Compensation Committee, the Board considers all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship with our Company that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including, but not limited to: (i) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by our Company to such director, and (ii) whether such director is affiliated with our Company, a subsidiary of our Company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of our Company — as required by the NYSE independence standards for compensation committee members. 
The Board has determined that the following directors are independent under the independence standards set forth in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards: Nelda J. Connors, Charles J. Dockendorff, Yoshiaki Fujimori, Donna A. James, Edward J. Ludwig, Stephen P. MacMillan, David J. Roux, John E. Sununu and Ellen M. Zane. 
The Board monitors its compliance with NYSE requirements for director independence on an ongoing basis, including through an annual review of director questionnaires and consideration of transactions and relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company as well as other relevant facts and circumstances. The Board and the Nominating and  Table of Contents
Governance Committee considered the directors' responses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships with the Company (and their immediate family members' relationships with the Company) and other potential conflicts of interest, as well as material provided by management related to transactions, relationships or arrangements between the Company and the directors or parties related to the directors. The Board made its determination as to whether any relationship between a director and our Company is a material relationship based on the facts and circumstances of the relationship, the amounts involved in the relationship, the director's interest in such relationship, if any, and such other factors as the Board, in its judgment, deemed appropriate. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Director Nomination Process   
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for determining the appropriate skills and characteristics required of new Board members in the context of the current make-up of the Board. In so doing, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, with input from the Board, those factors it deems appropriate, such as independence, experience, strength of character, judgment, technical skills, diversity, years of experience and the extent to which the individual would fill a present need on the Board. The aim is to assemble a Board that is strong in its collective knowledge and that consists of individuals who bring a variety of complementary attributes and who, taken together, have the appropriate skills and experience to oversee the Company's business. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers diversity as one of a number of factors in identifying nominees for director. It does not, however, have a formal policy in this regard. The Nominating and Governance Committee views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint, as well as other diversity concepts such as ethnicity and gender. 
Director nominees must, at a minimum, meet the general criteria outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Generally, directors should be individuals who have succeeded in their particular field and who demonstrate integrity, reliability, knowledge of corporate affairs and an ability to work well with others, and should also satisfy at least one of the following criteria:
The Nominating and Governance Committee receives suggestions for new directors from a number of sources, including independent Board members and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. It also may, in its discretion, employ a third-party search firm to assist in identifying candidates for director. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will also consider recommendations for Board membership submitted by our stockholders and other sources, and considers director nominees for election so submitted if the submission is made in accordance with the advance notice provisions of our By-Laws. The qualifications of candidates recommended by stockholders will be reviewed and considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee with the same degree of care and consideration as candidates for nomination to the Board submitted by independent Board members and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Table of Contents
The full Board is responsible for final approval of new director candidates, as well as the nomination of existing directors for re-election. With respect to existing directors, prior to making its recommendation to the full Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board, reviews each director's continuation on the Board as a regular part of the annual nominating process. 
Under the advance notice provisions of our By-Laws, director nominations and proposals to bring any other business before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders by our stockholders must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices on or before November 28, 2019. Director nominations by our stockholders must also satisfy the other procedures set forth in the advance notice provisions of our By-Laws. Should you wish to submit a director recommendation or nomination, have it addressed to our Corporate Secretary at Boston Scientific Corporation, 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Refreshment   
[END TABLE]
The Board has not established any term or age limits to an individual's membership on the Board. While these limits could help ensure that there are fresh ideas and viewpoints available to the Board, they have the disadvantage of causing the loss to the Company of the contribution of directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing insight into the Company and its operations and, therefore, provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. The Nominating and Governance Committee, as part of its annual assessment of the composition of the Board, reviews a director's continuation on the Board. The Company believes that, through regular evaluation of performance and the Company's needs, the Company will continue to achieve the appropriate balance between Boston Scientific experience and fresh ideas and perspectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Chief Executive Officer Succession   
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Governance Committee reports to the full Board periodically on succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer (and other executive officers, as appropriate). Our Chief Executive Officer discusses with the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee at least once per year, his recommendations and evaluations of potential successors to his position, including in the event of an unexpected emergency, and reviews development plans, if any, recommended for such individuals. Additionally, the Nominating and  Table of Contents
Governance Committee conducts an annual review of the CEO Succession Plan framework, which outlines certain high-level planning, notification and other actions, and is designed to minimize disruption in the event of a temporary or permanent absence of the Chief Executive Officer. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Leadership Structure   
[END TABLE]
Our Board believes that it is important that it retain flexibility to make the determination as to whether the interests of the Company and our stockholders are best served by having the same individual serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board or whether the roles should be separated based on the circumstances at any given time. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board will appoint a Lead Independent Director when the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles are combined or if the Chairman is not otherwise independent. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Lead Independent Director is appointed annually, though is generally expected to serve for a renewable term of three years, subject to annual re-election to the Board. The Lead Independent Director will preside over meetings of our non-management directors, serve as liaison between our Chairman and the independent directors, work with the Chairman to establish agendas for Board and committee meetings, raise issues with management on behalf of the independent directors, consult with committee leadership, and carry out other duties as requested by the Board. The Lead Independent Director also has the authority to call special meetings of independent or non-management directors, as needed. 
Mr. Mahoney has been our President and Chief Executive Officer since November 2012 and the Chairman of our Board since May 2016. In light of the fact that the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles have been combined since May 2016, the Board appointed Mr. Ludwig at that time to serve as Lead Independent Director, and has re-appointed him to serve in that role for an additional three-year term, subject to his re-election to the Board at this Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Ludwig's qualifications to serve as our Lead Independent Director include his strong leadership experience as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Becton, Dickinson and Company, his service on the Board of CVS Health Corporation and the Chair of that board's Finance Committee, and as lead director on the Board of Aetna, Inc. prior to its acquisition by CVS Health Corporation. Our Board believes that this leadership structure, coupled with a commitment to Board independence, provides effective independent oversight of management, while fostering a constructive and cooperative relationship between the Board and management and allowing both the Board and management to benefit from Mr. Mahoney's day-to-day familiarity with our business operations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Evaluations   
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors conducts annual self-evaluations, overseen by the Nominating and Governance Committee in accordance with the committee's charter. The self-evaluations have been facilitated by a third party, and have included in-person and telephonic interviews with directors and presentation of results by the facilitator to our Board and individual directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Risk Oversight   
[END TABLE]
Our Board oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of our strategic and organizational objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and to enhance stockholder value. A fundamental part of risk oversight is to understand the individual risks our Company faces, the steps management is taking to manage those risks, including the framework used by management for the coordinated oversight, control and continuous improvement of processes used to manage risk, and to assess management's appetite for risk. It is  Table of Contents management's responsibility to manage risk and bring to the Board's attention material risks facing our Company. Our Board receives regular reports from management on matters relating to strategic and operational initiatives, financial performance and legal developments, which are each integrated with enterprise-risk exposures. The involvement of the full Board in approving our strategic plan is a key part of its assessment of the risks inherent in our corporate strategy. 
While the Board has the ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, each committee of the Board also oversees risk to the extent that it relates to the committee's responsibilities, as outlined below. Each committee makes reports in its respective area of responsibility to the Board at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting immediately following the committee meeting. 
Given the Board's role in risk oversight, it believes that any leadership structure that it adopts must allow it to effectively oversee the management of the risks relating to our operations. Although there are different leadership structures that could allow our Board to oversee risk management effectively, and while our Board believes our current leadership structure will enable it to manage such risks effectively, it was one factor among many considered by our Board in selecting this leadership structure over other potential alternatives. For a discussion of the reasons why our Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate, please see the "Board Leadership Structure" above.  Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Communications with the Board   
[END TABLE]
Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate directly with any member of our Board, or our non-management directors as a group, may do so by writing to the Board of Directors or Non-Management Directors, Boston Scientific Corporation, c/o General Counsel, 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752 or by contacting the Board via email at BSCboardofdirectors@bsci.com or non-management directors at non-managementdirectors@bsci.com. The Board has authorized the office of our General Counsel to review and organize, but not screen, communications from stockholders and other interested parties and deliver them to the Board or non-management directors, as applicable. We do screen commercial solicitations for appropriateness. 
The Company is committed to stockholder engagement. In addition to the communication process detailed above, stockholders also have the opportunity to speak at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, participate in the annual "say-on-pay" advisory vote and communicate with our active Investor Relations department, among other avenues for engagement. The Board seriously considers the views of stockholders in its decision-making process. For instance, in response to engagement with certain stockholders and evaluation of current corporate governance best practices, the Board has determined it would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to propose an amendment to the Company's By-Laws to implement a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, subject to stockholder approval at this Annual Meeting of Stockholders. For additional information on this proposal, please see page 98 of this Proxy Statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board and Committee Service Limitation   
[END TABLE]
Without the approval of the Nominating and Governance Committee, no director may sit on more than three public company boards (in addition to our Board) and our Chief Executive Officer may not sit on more than one public company board (in addition to our Board). No director may serve simultaneously on the audit committees of more than three public companies (including the Company), unless the Board of Directors has determined that such service would not impair the ability of the member to effectively serve on the Company's Audit Committee, such determination to be disclosed in accordance with applicable NYSE or SEC rules. At the May 2017 Board meeting, the Board made a determination that the then-proposed service of Mr. Dockendorff on the audit committee of a fourth public company (including the Company) would not impair his ability to effectively serve on the Company's Audit Committee. All of our Board members have complied with these limitations or procedures. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Related Party Transactions   
[END TABLE]
Our Board has adopted a written related party transaction policy to monitor transactions, arrangements or relationships in which the Company and any of the following have an interest: (i) any person who is or was (since the beginning of 2018, even if they do not presently serve in that role) an executive officer or director or director nominee; (ii) any person who is a director emeritus; (iii) any person or entity who holds more than a 5% beneficial ownership of our common stock; (iv) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing; or (v) any entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or acts in any similar position in which such person or persons collectively have a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest. The policy covers any related party transaction that meets the minimum threshold for disclosure under relevant SEC rules (generally, transactions involving amounts exceeding $120,000 in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest).  Table of Contents
Related party transaction oversight is the responsibility of our Nominating and Governance Committee. Our General Counsel is responsible for identifying any potential related party transactions and, if she determines that an existing or proposed transaction constitutes a related party transaction under the policy, she will provide relevant details and an analysis of the related party transaction to the Nominating and Governance Committee. The General Counsel provides an annual summary to the Nominating and Governance Committee of all transactions or relationships which she considered under this policy, including those that she determined do not constitute a related party transaction. If the General Counsel has an interest in a potential related party transaction, she will provide all relevant information to the Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee, who will provide the information to the other members of such Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews relevant information concerning any existing or proposed transaction contemplated by the Company with an entity that is the subject of a disclosed relationship, and approves or rejects the transaction, with or without conditions or additional protections for the Company. Our related party transactions policy can be found in our Corporate Governance Guidelines available under "Governance Overview" in the "Investor Relations" section of our website at www.bostonscientific.com. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Code of Conduct   
[END TABLE]
We maintain a Code of Conduct, which has been approved by our Board, to ensure that our directors, employees and officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, understand the basic principles that govern our corporate conduct. The Code of Conduct is available under "Governance Overview" in the "Investor Relations" section of our website at www.bostonscientific.com. A stockholder may request a copy of the Code of Conduct by contacting our Corporate Secretary at Boston Scientific Corporation, 300 Boston Scientific Way, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752.

Directors are expected to prepare for and use reasonable efforts to participate in all Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which they serve. The Board and each committee will meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities, provided that the full Board will meet at least four times per year. Generally, the Board meets in February, May, August and November. In addition, directors are expected to use reasonable efforts to attend Annual Meetings of Stockholders.

[END TABLE]
Our Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (Compensation Committee) met five times in 2018. Ms. James, Ms. Connors, and Messrs. Ludwig and MacMillan are the current members of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is, and was during 2018, comprised exclusively of "independent directors," as defined by the NYSE, including under the heightened independence standards applicable to compensation committee members, "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 
As outlined in its written charter, the Compensation Committee has the responsibility to, among other things:
The Compensation Committee may delegate its authority and duties to subcommittees or individual members of the Compensation Committee, as it deems appropriate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to our Chief Executive Officer to make equity grants to new hires and retention awards to existing employees who are not executive officers within predetermined guidelines. These grants are reviewed with the Compensation Committee  Table of Contents at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Compensation Committee may also delegate authority to make amendments to the Company's benefit plans and Global Employee Stock Ownership Plan to the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, that he or she determines to be necessary to maintain compliance with applicable law or other technical amendments that do not materially increase the cost of the plans to the Company. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain or obtain advice from any compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor, as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate to assist the Committee in the performance of its duties, including the sole authority to approve the compensation and other terms and conditions of retention. Prior to any such retention, and on an annual basis, the Compensation Committee considers any factors relevant to such consultant's, legal counsel's or advisor's independence from management, including the factors specified in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards or other listing rules, to evaluate whether the services to be performed will raise any conflict of interest or compromise the independence of such consultant, legal counsel or advisor. Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC (Semler Brossy) served as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant in 2018. During 2018, Semler Brossy provided the following compensation services to the Compensation Committee:
For additional information regarding the services provided by Semler Brossy, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section. 
In 2018, Semler Brossy and its affiliates did not provide additional services to the Company other than at the request of the Compensation Committee. After review and consultation with Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee determined that Semler Brossy is independent, and there is no conflict of interest resulting from retaining Semler Brossy currently or during 2018. In reaching these conclusions, the Compensation Committee considered the factors set forth in the SEC rules and the NYSE listing standards. 
In accordance with its annual review of its compensation consultant engagement, the Compensation Committee will evaluate the engagement of Semler Brossy in May 2019.

  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION     
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Elements of Director Compensation   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee evaluates the appropriate level and form of compensation for non-employee directors at least annually and recommends changes to our Board when appropriate. Non-employee directors receive a combination of cash and equity compensation for their service on our Board. To determine the level of compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee relied on the consulting services of Semler Brossy, as well as publicly available data describing director compensation in our peer group companies, to establish an appropriate and competitive level of compensation. The Compensation Committee generally aims to provide a level of compensation that is competitive with the median of peer and other similar companies. The Compensation Committee also took into consideration the significant amount of time and dedication required by our directors to fulfill their duties on our Board and Board committees as well as the need to continue to attract highly qualified candidates to serve on our Board. Our director compensation is as follows: 
   Non-Employee Directors  
   2018 Compensation  
For their service for the annual term beginning on the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we have compensated our non-employee directors as described below and in the following sections:
The annual equity grants are made on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders. If a non-employee director is appointed to the Board on a date other than the annual meeting of stockholders, an equity grant in an amount equal to the then-current non-employee director annual award, prorated for the time period from the effective date of the appointment to the next annual meeting of stockholders, is made on the first trading day of the month following the month in which the new director was appointed to the Board. Such awards made to new non-employee directors become free from restriction upon the expiration of the new director's current term of office on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders immediately following the date of grant, subject to the director's continuation of service during such term. Additionally, if a non-employee director is appointed to the Board on a date other than the annual meeting of stockholders, the annual cash retainer for such director will be prorated for the time period from the effective date of the appointment to the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
For their service for the annual term beginning on the date of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the annual cash retainer was $100,000 and the annual cash fee for the chair of our Audit  Table of Contents
Committee was $20,000. In November 2017, and effective from the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the Compensation Committee removed stock options from the equity alternatives that were available to directors to receive as all or a portion of their cash compensation or annual equity grant. 
   Cash Compensation  
Each non-employee director receives the annual cash retainer and fees on a quarterly basis. For 2018, each non-employee director could elect to receive all or a portion of his or her cash compensation as one or both of two equity alternatives, each to vest on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders immediately following the date of grant, subject to the director's continuation of service during such term: (i) restricted stock valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant; and (ii) deferred stock units, valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant (with shares of our common stock to be issued only after a director's separation from Board service in accordance with the Boston Scientific Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, effective January 1, 2014 (the 2014 Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan)). Each non-employee director could also choose to defer receipt of all or a portion of his or her annual cash compensation under the 2014 Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan, as described further below. 
   Equity Compensation  
The annual equity grants are made on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders and are subject to the terms and conditions of our 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2011 LTIP). In 2018, each non-employee director could elect to receive his or her annual equity award as one or both of the following two equity compensation alternatives, each to vest on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders immediately following the date of grant, subject to the director's continuation of service during such term: (i) restricted stock valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant; and (ii) deferred stock units valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant (with shares of our common stock to be issued only after a director's separation from Board service in accordance with the 2014 Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan). 
   Employee Directors  
Directors who are also employees of the Company receive no compensation for serving on the Board or its committees. 
   Other Payments and Benefits  
We pay or reimburse our directors for transportation, hotel, meals and other incidental expenses incurred in connection with their performance of services for us, including attending Board and committee meetings and participating in director education programs. Our corporate aircraft is made available to our directors for travel to and from our Board meetings, as well as for certain other Company business travel. We also extend directors' and officers' indemnity insurance coverage to each of our directors. 
   Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plans  
Each non-employee director may, by written election, defer receipt of all or a portion of the annual cash retainer, annual cash committee chair fees and equity compensation under our 2014 Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Cash amounts deferred can be invested in  Table of Contents deemed investment options in which we credit the amount deferred plus any earnings from the chosen investment options. Investment options under the plan are generally the same as those offered under the Company's 401(k) Plan through Vanguard, except that, among other things, directors may not elect to invest in the BSC Stock Fund. Deferred cash amounts are payable, at the non-employee director's written election, in either a lump-sum or in annual installments after a director's separation from Board service or in a lump-sum on an earlier fixed date (in all cases in accordance with the plan). 
   Director Stock Ownership Guidelines  
We believe the stock ownership requirements for our non-employee directors align the interests of our directors with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our director stock ownership guidelines provide that each non-employee director should own shares with a value equal to at least five times the director annual cash retainer within five years of his or her joining the Board. For purposes of satisfying this obligation, stock units and stock or stock unit deferrals under a Company deferred compensation plan may be included in the aggregate number of shares held by a director. All of our non-employee directors who have served five years or more currently meet our director stock ownership guidelines. The Nominating and Governance Committee monitors compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis. For information regarding the stock ownership guidelines applicable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled "Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines."

   Executive Summary

   Strategic Imperatives Linked to 2018 Executive Compensation  
During 2018, we continued to focus on the following five strategic imperatives to help drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase stockholder value:
   Pay for Performance  
Our short- and long-term incentive plans incorporate metrics designed to align with the objective of driving profitable growth and reward Company and individual progress related to the strategic  imperatives. Below is a snapshot of 2018 financial performance metrics used in our short- and long-term incentive programs: 
   CEO's Total Direct Compensation Aligns with Company Performance  
Our executive compensation philosophy is to provide appropriate competitive compensation opportunities to our executives with actual pay outcomes tied to achievement of Company and individual performance targets in support of our business strategy and creation of long-term stockholder value. 
Each year, the Compensation Committee assesses our CEO's actual compensation relative to the Company's performance. The following graph shows the relationship of our CEO's total direct compensation (as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table) (TDC) compared against our cumulative total shareholder return (TSR) performance in each of the last three years. The TDC in this chart consists of base salary and annual short- and long-term incentives. As illustrated, CEO compensation was generally aligned with Company performance.    CEO Compensation(1)   Summary Compensation Table Total Direct Compensation   versus 3-Year Total Shareholder Return(2)     
The following chart shows the value of the primary elements of total direct compensation, consisting of base salary and annual short- and long- term incentives, for our CEO in 2018 (i) at "target" opportunity as considered by our Compensation Committee; (ii) as disclosed in our Summary Compensation Table; and (iii) as "realizable" at December 31, 2018. These values were calculated using the 2018 base salary, annual equity incentives and Annual Bonus Plan ("ABP") award amounts for our CEO as set forth in the table following the chart below.    2018 CEO Compensation   Target vs. Summary Compensation Table vs. Realizable

   Realizable                     Annual base salary earned in 2018                   Actual 2018 Annual Bonus Plan award                  Annual equity awards granted on February 15, 2018, with:    (a) stock options valued at their intrinsic value (number of options awarded multiplied by the closing   price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 less the exercise price of such options);    (b) service-based DSUs valued using the number of units awarded multiplied   by the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018;    (c) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance-based DSUs valued using 200% of the target TSR   performance-based DSUs due to the Company's TSR rank being 6th out of 58 (200% of the target number of units multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018); and    (d) the free cash flow (FCF) performance-based DSUs valued using 117.9% of the target FCF performance-based DSUs (the actual percentage of target units earned under the program) multiplied by the   closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018.

   Realizable                     Annual base salary earned in 2018                   Actual 2018 Annual Bonus Plan award                  Annual equity awards granted on February 15, 2018, with:    (a) stock options valued at their intrinsic value (number of options awarded multiplied by the closing   price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 less the exercise price of such options);    (b) service-based DSUs valued using the number of units awarded multiplied   by the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018;    (c) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance-based DSUs valued using 200% of the target TSR   performance-based DSUs due to the Company's TSR rank being 6th out of 58 (200% of the target number of units multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018); and    (d) the free cash flow (FCF) performance-based DSUs valued using 117.9% of the target FCF performance-based DSUs (the actual percentage of target units earned under the program) multiplied by the   closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018. 
   Realizable                     Annual base salary earned in 2018                   Actual 2018 Annual Bonus Plan award                  Annual equity awards granted on February 15, 2018, with:    (a) stock options valued at their intrinsic value (number of options awarded multiplied by the closing   price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 less the exercise price of such options);    (b) service-based DSUs valued using the number of units awarded multiplied   by the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018;    (c) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance-based DSUs valued using 200% of the target TSR   performance-based DSUs due to the Company's TSR rank being 6th out of 58 (200% of the target number of units multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018); and    (d) the free cash flow (FCF) performance-based DSUs valued using 117.9% of the target FCF performance-based DSUs (the actual percentage of target units earned under the program) multiplied by the   closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
 The difference in value of the long-term incentive compensation portion of our CEO's TDC reflected in the "Realizable" column of the chart above relative to the values reflected in the "Target" and "Summary Compensation Table" columns is primarily due to three factors:
The higher equity value in the "Realizable" column of the chart above relative to those in the "Target" and "Summary Compensation Table" columns is directly tied to our stock price appreciation and the achievement of performance criteria, which we believe demonstrates the linkage between our executive compensation program and the long-term interests of our stockholders. The long-term incentive portion of the CEO's compensation will remain "at-risk" and the value will vary until the completion of the vesting periods or until the exercise date for each of the equity awards 
   A Significant Portion of our NEOs' 2018 Target TDC is At-Risk, Performance-Based Compensation  
Our Compensation Committee ties a significant portion of our executives' target TDC to at-risk, performance-based incentive opportunities. For 2018, approximately 91% of the target value of the primary elements of TDC for our CEO and approximately 81% of the target value of the primary elements of TDC for our other NEOs as a group consisted of at-risk, performance-based incentive compensation, comprised of short-term incentives (Annual Bonus Plan award) and long-term incentives (performance- and service-based equity awards and stock options). For more details and a breakdown of the elements of TDC, please see the section titled "Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation, Primary Elements of Total Direct Compensation". 
The percentages above were calculated using the 2018 base salary, target equity values and target Annual Bonus Plan award amounts for our NEOs set forth in the footnote to the charts below. The allocation of the target value of the primary elements of TDC for our CEO and for our other NEOs as a group in 2018 was as follows:   Compensation Table" and with both service-based DSUs and Company performance-based DSUs valued at target (using the number of units and target units awarded multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant); (ii) the target Annual Bonus Plan awards; and (iii) the annual base salaries approved for Messrs. Mahoney, Ballinger, Brennan, Fitzgerald and Pierce in February 2018. 
We believe our emphasis on at-risk, performance-based incentive compensation aligns our executives' financial interests with our business strategy and the short- and long-term interests of our stockholders, providing "pay for performance" and putting a significant portion of our executives' pay "at risk." 
   Executive Compensation Program Best Practices  
Our Compensation Committee believes that a strong foundation for our compensation program is necessary to execute our executive compensation philosophy effectively. The following best practices serve as the foundation for our executive compensation program:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Say on Pay   
[END TABLE]
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we asked our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the 2017 compensation of our then NEOs as disclosed in our 2018 Proxy Statement, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" advisory vote. Our stockholders approved the compensation of our then-NEOs with approximately 95.7% of the votes cast voting in favor of the proposal. In connection with its review of our compensation program against our executive compensation philosophy, business objectives and peer group practices, our Compensation Committee considered the prior years' modifications to our compensation programs in support of our executive compensation philosophy and best practices, the results of the say-on-pay advisory vote, as well as prior stockholder feedback. As a result, our Compensation Committee concluded that it would retain the overall structure and design of our compensation program, including its emphasis on at-risk, performance-based incentive compensation.

   How We Determine Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
   Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

   Competitive Market Analysis  
Our Compensation Committee uses competitive market analysis as a decision-making reference. The Committee primarily considers executive compensation comparative data for our peer group companies to better understand trends and comparative practices, program design in the market within which we compete for top talent, and competitive levels and mix of target compensation opportunities provided to our executives. Our peer group includes companies (i) operating in a comparable industry (customer base and product offerings) such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and life sciences, and healthcare equipment and services companies, and (ii) that, in the aggregate, approximate our size as measured by revenue and market capitalization. 
Each year, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, our Compensation Committee reviews the composition and appropriateness of our peer group. The Committee considers  the size, performance, and business focus of these companies in comparison to us. The peer companies used to establish 2018 compensation levels include:

In establishing 2018 pay levels for our NEOs, the Compensation Committee reviewed comparative pay information for the peer group companies through proxy research and, where peer group information was unavailable, from 2018 general industry survey data which was calibrated to include companies comparable to our size and scope of each individual's responsibilities. The Company considers market data without regard for any particular percentile positioning. This allows us to retain flexibility to make individual decisions that reflect both market and internal considerations, including those described below under "Internal Pay Equity and Other Considerations." 
   2019 Peer Companies  
In 2018, the Compensation Committee conducted a review of the compensation peer group to be used in setting 2019 executive pay levels, with the advice of Semler Brossy. The review focused on examining current peers for business fit, and considering for potential additions to the group the market for companies of comparable size within the life sciences and medical device industries. Based on this review, Mylan, Inc. and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. were removed to maintain the industry focus of the group, and C.R. Bard, Inc. was removed due to its December, 2017 acquisition by Becton, Dickinson and Company. Four companies (Agilent, Danaher, Hologic, and Intuitive Surgical) were added, to ensure a sufficiently large comparator group and to position the Company near median in  terms of size. The Compensation Committee believes that the resulting 2019 peer group, in aggregate, appropriately reflects the Company's business mix and competitive landscape. 
   Internal Pay Equity and Other Considerations  
In addition to the competitive market analysis, the Committee considers multiple factors in formulating compensation decisions. These factors include:
   Performance Considerations  
We utilize a performance, development and coaching (PDC) process to help guide individual development and performance discussions and to assess annual performance. Our CEO conducts annual PDC reviews for all direct reports, assesses the performance results of those direct reports and makes recommendations to our Compensation Committee for its consideration. Our Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates our CEO's performance objectives and oversees the evaluation of his performance in relation to those objectives. For 2018, the overall performance of our executives, including our NEOs, supports a culture of high performance, integrity and accountability with clear expectations. These performance evaluations, among the other considerations described in this section, influence the Compensation Committee's decisions regarding our executives' base salaries, the individual component of their Annual Bonus Plan awards and, as an indication of future performance potential, their long-term equity incentive awards. 
   Chief Executive Officer and Compensation Committee Judgment  
The application of CEO and Compensation Committee judgment is an important factor in setting and determining executive pay. We do not employ a purely formulaic approach to our executive compensation program. Target market guidelines and individual target TDC, financial and operational targets, individual performance objectives and funding formulae are established in advance; however, other Company and individual performance and other considerations may also be taken into account. For example, while the funding formula tied to Company-level financial performance targets are set in advance under our Annual Bonus Plan, our Compensation Committee is able to reduce the total Annual Bonus Plan funding percentage (Total Bonus Pool), to not less than 50% of the target, based on its assessment of the Company's progress toward achievement of our quality objectives, which are critical to our commitment to providing high quality products to our customers and patients. Additionally, beginning with our 2019 Annual Bonus Plan program, the Compensation Committee may also reduce the Total Bonus Pool funding percentage based on performance against operating income margin targets, which takes into consideration the Company's profitability, as well as affordability of the proposed bonus funding.

   Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
   Primary Elements of Total Direct Compensation  
We compensate our executives primarily through total direct compensation, namely in the form of base salary and short- and long-term incentives (the primary elements of TDC). Our primary elements of TDC are heavily weighted towards variable, at-risk performance-based elements, which are reflected below and in the charts under the section above titled "A Significant Portion of our NEOs' 2018 Target TDC is At-Risk, Performance-Based Compensation." These percentages were calculated using the 2018 base salary, target equity values and target Annual Bonus Plan award amounts for our NEOs set forth in the footnotes to the charts under the section titled "A Significant Portion of our NEOs' 2018 Target TDC is At-Risk, Performance-Based Compensation."
The key features and objectives of the primary elements of our NEOs' 2018 TDC are summarized in the table below.     Base Salary  
In determining the 2018 base salaries of our NEOs (other than our Chief Executive Officer), our Compensation Committee also considered the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer in light of the general factors discussed above, including their overall performance ratings for the prior year. In addition to the merit increases, with respect to Messrs. Ballinger, Fitzgerald, and Pierce, the Compensation Committee included a market adjustment based on their market position relative to our peer group companies' executives with comparable positions and scope of responsibilities in determining the total increases of their base salaries from 2017 to 2018. 
The 2018 base salaries (rounded to the nearest thousand) for our NEOs, as well as the percentage increase from their 2017 base salaries for our current NEOs who were also NEOs in 2017, are set forth below.

   Short-Term Incentives  
Our Compensation Committee annually reviews the design of our Annual Bonus Plan to help ensure that the program continues to support our executive compensation philosophy and core compensation program objectives. In finalizing the design for 2018, our Compensation Committee retained substantially all of the provisions of our 2017 Annual Bonus Plan, which was designed to reinforce the concept of "pay for performance," align our short-term incentives with important financial and operational measures and the long-term interests of our stockholders, and to incentivize and reward individual performance. 
   2018 Annual Bonus Plan Awards Paid to Our NEOs  
After funding the Total Bonus Pool, the actual amount of an executive's Annual Bonus Plan award is ultimately determined as follows: 
   Total Bonus Pool Funded Based on Company Performance  
Under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, a single Company-wide Total Bonus Pool is funded by the Company's performance measured against important Company-level financial and operational performance metric targets, thereby reinforcing the importance of the Company's performance as a whole (which reflects the performance of our regions, businesses and functions). For 2018, our Compensation Committee selected adjusted EPS and Adjusted Net Sales as our Company-level financial metrics and set performance level targets as follows.    Company-Level Financial Targets     
In February 2018, our Compensation Committee approved the Total Bonus Pool funding scale for the Company's 2018 performance measured against our 2018 Company-level performance metric targets for adjusted EPS and adjusted net sales set forth in the table below. Each metric has a 50% weighting. 
In order to reinforce the importance of "top line" growth, Total Bonus Pool funding is capped at 90% in the event that the Company's adjusted net sales are below 97% of target. In addition, our Compensation Committee has the discretion to decrease the Total Bonus Pool funding percentage (to not less than 50% of the target) based on its assessment of the Company's performance relative to our quality objectives. For 2018, our quality objectives related to our quality culture, training, audits, reporting, compliance environment, and quality systems operations. Our Compensation Committee considers quality objectives to be appropriate in emphasizing our commitment to continually improving and sustaining our quality systems, our quality compliance and our product performance, thereby enhancing stockholder value. Beginning with the 2019 Annual Bonus Plan program, in addition to the quality assessment, the Compensation Committee may also reduce Total Annual Bonus funding based on performance against operating income margin targets.  For 2018, our performance against target financial metrics and corresponding bonus funding ranges were as follows: 
In accordance with the terms of the plan and after taking into consideration the Company's overall 2018 financial performance and performance against quality objectives, our Chief Executive Officer recommended, and our Compensation Committee approved, funding the 2018 Total Bonus Pool at 110%. 
   Funded Total Bonus Pool Allocated to Participating Units  
Under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, the Total Bonus Pool, as funded, is allocated by the Compensation Committee to each participating regional, business, and functional unit taking into consideration our Chief Executive Officer's recommendations in light of that participating unit's performance measured against its operational and/or financial performance metric targets (and other factors the Compensation Committee deems appropriate), thereby incentivizing and rewarding each participating unit's performance contributions. Our NEOs received their 2018 Annual Bonus Plan awards from the allocation of the funded Total Bonus Pool to our Interventional Cardiology unit (Mr. Ballinger), Rhythm and Neuro (Mr. Fitzgerald), MedSurg (Mr. Pierce) and to our corporate function unit (Messrs. Mahoney and Brennan). For 2018, the performance percentages were as follows: 
  Business Unit and Corporate Function   Performance Percentages     
The Interventional Cardiology, Rhythm and Neuro, and MedSurg, performance percentages reflect their respective overall performance measured against adjusted net sales, adjusted operating income and constant currency growth compared to market targets coinciding with the business's operating plan for the year. For the Corporate Function Unit, the performance percentage of 109% reflects the Company's overall performance and closely aligns with the 2018 Total Bonus Pool funding. 
The Company does not disclose the specific targets for business, regional and functional participating units' performance metrics as they are highly confidential and would provide competitors and third  parties with insight into the Company's internal planning processes that may allow them to predict certain of our business-, region- or function-specific financial or operational strategies, which could cause us competitive harm. Business and regional unit targets related to adjusted net sales, adjusted operating income and constant currency growth compared to market are established in support of Company-wide targets such as sales, operating income, earnings per share and growth. These are based on a range of factors, including growth outlooks for our product portfolio, the competitive environment, our internal budgets, external market economic conditions and market expectations. For example, growth rates implicit in targets for any one business or regional unit may be above or below the growth rates targeted for the entire Company, due to faster or slower growth in relevant markets or smaller or larger market shares. These considerations result in business and regional unit targets that are intended to coincide with Company-wide targets in their level of difficulty to achieve and probability for success. Performance targets are set at levels that the Company believes are aggressive enough to inspire top performance but reasonable enough to be achievable through the efficient and diligent execution of their operating plans. 
   Individual Target Incentive Award Opportunity  
Each executive's target incentive award opportunity under the Annual Bonus Plan is expressed as a percentage of his or her annual base salary and is determined based on the scope of the executive's responsibilities. For 2018, our Compensation Committee maintained or increased the target award opportunities for our NEOs from their 2017 levels. The following table shows target award opportunities in 2018 for our NEOs, and for those NEOs who were also NEOs for 2017, their target opportunities in 2017. The target award opportunities for Messrs. Brennan, Ballinger, Fitzgerald, and Pierce were based on the recommendations of our CEO, internal pay equity relative to our other executives, their increased experience in their roles and external market data.

   Individual Performance Component  
After year end, individual performance is considered pursuant to the PDC process described in the "Performance Considerations" section above. Based on the performance assessment rating under our annual PDC process, an individual performance multiplier from 0% to 150% is applied to an executive's funded Annual Bonus Plan award to determine the actual amount to be paid. The maximum individual performance multiplier was reduced from 200% to 150% in November 2017, which reduces total available discretion. 
Our NEOs had certain performance objectives intended to support our strategic imperatives, as applicable to their roles, including (i) with respect to our NEOs who support corporate functions, those aimed at driving Company-level financial performance objectives, and (ii) with respect to Messrs. Ballinger, Fitzgerald and Pierce, who each supports a business or businesses, those aimed at supporting business-level financial and operational performance objectives. The individual performance objectives discussed below represent factors that are considered by the Compensation Committee and our CEO in determining each NEO's individual performance percentage. Further, no single factor is determinative or required to be considered.

   Long-Term Incentives  
Our Compensation Committee annually reviews the design of our Long-Term Incentive Program (LTI Program) to help ensure that the program continues to support our executive compensation philosophy and core compensation program objectives. In setting the design for 2018, our Compensation Committee retained the mix of equity award opportunities for our executives under our prior LTI Program that were designed to further reinforce "pay for performance" and align the interests of our executives and their compensation with important Company financial measures and the long-term interests of our stockholders. The key features and objectives of each equity vehicle are summarized in the table below.

   2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards for Our NEOs  
In February 2018, our Compensation Committee approved the grant of long-term equity incentive awards to our NEOs in the amounts in the following table, which were based on the target dollar values of the long-term equity incentive awards for our NEOs considered by the Compensation Committee (see discussion of the target dollar values below). In approving the following grants, the Committee considered external market data and internal factors, including internal equity, performance, and potential.

[END TABLE]
The numbers of FCF and TSR performance-based DSUs and service-based DSUs were calculated by dividing the target dollar value of those awards by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, and the numbers of stock options were determined by dividing the target dollar value of that award by the stock option value determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, as described in the footnotes to the Executive Compensation section titled "Summary Compensation Table".    Company Performance-Based DSUs — Results for Performance Periods Ended December 31, 2018  
In February 2019, our Compensation Committee determined the number of deferred stock units earned pursuant to our performance-based DSUs under the 2016 TSR PSP and the 2018 FCF PSP, presented in the table below. 
   Primary Elements of Indirect Executive Compensation  
We also compensate our executives, including our NEOs, with indirect compensation, namely in the form of benefits and limited perquisites. Generally, our benefits and perquisites are targeted to be competitive relative to our peer group companies. The primary elements of and objectives for our NEOs' 2018 indirect compensation are summarized below. 
   General Employee Benefits  
We provide employee benefits to eligible employees, including our NEOs, to promote personal health and well-being and to provide certain financial security and protection upon retirement or in the event of death, disability or illness. As U.S.-based employees, our NEOs are eligible to receive employee benefits under our U.S. employee benefits program, which consists of the following key elements that are generally the same as those provided to our other U.S. salaried employees: In addition, our executive officers may participate in an annual executive level physical examination program that is designed to encourage the proactive management of executive health. In approving the program, the Compensation Committee considered the overall cost of the program (estimated to be less than $10,000 per participant), that a majority of our peer group companies offered some form of benefit related to executive level annual physical examinations, and the importance of good health to an executive's ability to focus on the short and long-term needs of the Company. Company-paid term life insurance premium amounts (and related imputed income), Company matches of 401(k) Plan contributions for our NEOs, Company-paid executive level annual physical examination costs, and certain other reimbursements in 2018 are reported in the footnotes to the Executive Compensation section titled "Summary Compensation Table." 
   Deferred Compensation Programs  
We maintain a Deferred Bonus Plan for certain of our management, including our NEOs, in order to provide them with the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their annual award under our Annual Bonus Plan until the earlier of termination of employment or an elected distribution date. In 2018, Messrs. Ballinger and Fitzgerald elected to defer 75% of their 2018 Annual Bonus Plan Award, which otherwise would have been paid in 2019, under the Deferred Bonus Plan. For additional discussion of the Deferred Bonus Plan, please see the narrative to the Executive Compensation section titled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
   Relocation Program  
We provide tiered relocation benefits under our relocation program to eligible employees, including our NEOs, whom we request to move in connection with their current position or a promotion and for eligible new hires we require to move in connection with accepting a position with us. Our objectives in providing relocation benefits are to attract and redeploy top talent. We provide "tax gross-ups" on applicable relocation benefits provided under our relocation program as we believe that this benefit is integral to the Company's ability to attract and retain employees whose skill or knowledge enhance the Company's competitive position. Participants are generally required to sign a reimbursement agreement that requires them to pay back expenses incurred by the Company for their relocation in the event that they voluntarily terminate their employment or are terminated for "cause" at a rate of 100% for termination within one year of the date on which payments were first made and 50% for termination following the first year but within two years of the date on which payments were first made. NEO relocation benefits for 2018 are included in the footnotes to the Executive Compensation section titled "Summary Compensation Table." 
In accordance with the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Mahoney is eligible for the executive tier of our relocation program. In August 2018, our Compensation Committee approved an additional time extension of Mr. Mahoney's relocation benefits under the executive tier of our relocation program for up to one year, ending December 31, 2019. In approving the extension, our Compensation Committee took into consideration the fact that there would be no additional cost to the Company to provide this extension and Mr. Mahoney's desire to maintain stability for his family at their current residence until the end of the extended period. 
   Personal Use of Aircraft  
Pursuant to Mr. Mahoney's offer letter, he is permitted reasonable personal use of our corporate aircraft up to $100,000 per year in aggregate incremental cost to the Company. Our other executives are permitted limited personal use of our corporate aircraft with prior approval. These executives are personally taxed on their personal use of our corporate aircraft and we do not provide them with income tax gross-up payments. The aggregate incremental cost to the Company (and disallowed tax deductions of the Company) for our NEOs' personal use of our corporate aircraft in 2018 is included in the footnotes to the Executive Compensation section titled "Summary Compensation Table."  
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Our Post-Employment and Change in Control Arrangements   
[END TABLE]
   Primary Elements of Post-Employment and Change in Control Arrangements  
None of our NEOs has an employment agreement with the Company. However, we provide post-employment and change in control payments and benefits to our executives under certain circumstances. We believe that offering our executives these payments and benefits facilitates the operation of our business, allows them to better focus their time, attention and capabilities on our business, and assists the Company in recruiting and retaining key executives. The primary elements of and objectives for our NEOs' 2018 post-employment and change in control agreements are summarized below. 
   Executive Retirement Plan  
Our executives are eligible to participate in our defined benefit Executive Retirement Plan. For further discussion of our defined benefit Executive Retirement Plan, please see the narrative to the Executive Compensation section titled "Defined Benefit Retirement Plan." 
   Severance Plans  
We maintain severance plans for eligible employees, including our NEOs, under which participants are entitled to receive certain severance payments, subsidized COBRA health benefits and dental benefits for specified periods of time. For further discussion of our severance plans, please see the Executive Compensation section titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control — Severance Plans." 
   Change in Control Agreements  
We have entered into change in control agreements to our executives, including our NEOs, and other key employees (Change in Control Agreements). The possibility of a change in control and the uncertainty that it may raise among our executives as to their continued employment after or in connection with a change in control may result in their departure or distraction. Our objective in providing Change in Control Agreements is to retain and encourage the continued attention and dedication of our executives during a potentially critical time, even if they are concerned that their position will be eliminated after or in connection with the change in control. Our Change in Control Agreements require both a change in control and termination without cause or resignation for good reason within two years after the change in control event, commonly referred to as a "double-trigger," for cash payments to be made under the agreement and vesting to be accelerated under the agreements for equity awards where the surviving or acquiring entity substitutes or assumes outstanding equity awards. 
For further discussion of our Change in Control Agreements, other plans and arrangements under which a change in control and/or termination of employment triggers payments or benefits, and potential payments to our NEOs under the foregoing, please see the narrative and tables in the Executive Compensation section titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control — Change in Control Agreements."  
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Clawback Policy   
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee has adopted a policy regarding the recovery or adjustment of short-term incentive awards paid to an executive in the event relevant Company performance measures are restated in a manner that would have reduced the size of a previously granted award. In such an event, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company would seek to recover the amount of the short-term incentive award paid to such executive that was in excess of the amount that would have been awarded based on the restated financial results, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the policy. Our Compensation Committee monitors regulatory developments with respect to applicable executive compensation recovery policies required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and it expects to consider such changes to the Company's current recovery policy as are necessary to comply with final rules (and related guidance, if any) to be issued by the SEC in accordance with such act. 
Our Compensation Committee has also adopted a policy regarding the recovery of certain short- and long-term incentive compensation awards paid or granted to an executive in the event of executive misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that resulted in a material violation of Company policy and caused significant harm to the Company. In such an event, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may seek reimbursement of all or a portion of cash incentive compensation awards paid within a certain time period and/or recovery of all or a portion of equity incentive awards granted to such executive over which the Company retains control, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the policy. 
Both of the policies described above are only applicable to awards made after the adoption of the relevant policy. For a discussion of other recovery and forfeiture provisions relating to incentive compensation awards and other benefits provided to our executives, please see the section titled "Relocation Program" above, and the Executive Compensation sections titled "Retirement Plan Benefits" and "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines   
[END TABLE]
Our executives are required to have a significant personal investment in the Company through their ownership of shares of our common stock. Our Board has set stock ownership guidelines for executives, including our NEOs, as a number of shares of Company stock equal in value to at least the following amounts:
Executives are required to comply with the guidelines at all times. However, if at any time an executive's ownership does not meet or exceed the guideline, he or she is expected to retain ownership of at least fifty percent of net shares with respect to each vesting of an equity award or stock option exercise until the guideline is met or exceeded. For purposes of satisfying the guidelines, shares owned outright, shares held in company benefit plans and the intrinsic value of vested "in-the-money" stock options are included in the aggregate number of shares held by an executive. Unvested equity award shares (including service-based DSUs and performance-based DSUs) and unvested stock options are not included in the aggregate number of shares held by an executive. The Nominating and Governance Committee monitors compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2018, our CEO and other NEOs were in compliance with these guidelines.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Prohibition on Pledging and Hedging the Economic Value of our Common Stock   
[END TABLE]
Our executives, including our NEOs, and our directors, are prohibited from speculating in the Company's securities, engaging in transactions designed to "hedge" the value of our common stock, and pledging their common stock as collateral for a loan. None of our executives or directors is engaged in hedging or pledging arrangements related to the Company's securities. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   No Tax Gross-Ups (other than for Relocation Benefits)   
[END TABLE]
The Company does not provide tax gross-ups for our executives, except for relocation benefits because the benefit generally applies to all employees eligible to receive relocation benefits, including our executives, and the Compensation Committee believes it is integral to the Company's ability to attract and redeploy employees whose skill or knowledge enhance the Company's competitive position. Mr. Mahoney received approximately $21,000 in relocation benefits in 2018.

   Tax and Accounting Considerations   
[END TABLE]
Section 162(m) of the Code (Section 162(m)) generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1 million paid to certain "covered employees," which historically included a company's CEO and the three other most highly compensated executive officers, other than the CFO, employed by the company at the end of the year. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, the definition of "covered employees" under Section 162(m) was amended to include a company's CFO. Once an officer is a "covered employee," their compensation will remain subject to Section 162(m) for so long as they are receiving compensation from the company. Further, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the exclusion for "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) effective January 1, 2018, except for compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract in place before November 2, 2017 that is not materially modified thereafter (a grandfathered arrangement). For 2018, although we had plans in place that were intended to permit the award of qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), our Compensation Committee did not necessarily limit executive compensation to deductible amounts.  Beginning in 2018, there was no qualified performance-based compensation exemption, other than for grandfathered arrangements. Outstanding awards of the Company that previously qualified for the performance-based compensation exclusion under Section 162(m) may or may not qualify as grandfathered awards. 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, which requires the Company to recognize compensation expense for share-based payments (including stock options and other forms of equity compensation). FASB ASC Topic 718 is taken into account by the Compensation Committee in determining to use a portfolio approach to equity grants, awarding both stock options and DSUs.  Table of Contents 
  RISK ASSESSMENT OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS     
With the assistance of the senior members of our Global Compensation and Benefits organization, certain senior executive officers and the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, in February 2019 the Compensation Committee reviewed a risk assessment of our compensation programs and policies to determine if the provisions and operations of our programs create undesired or unintentional risk of a material nature. 
Our risk assessment included two work streams — one focused on reviewing areas of enterprise risk and the other focused on identifying compensation design risk. Our enterprise risk analysis examined the types and magnitudes of risks our business areas present to the Company so that the Committee could assess the extent to which our compensation programs may mitigate or exacerbate these risks. Our compensation design risk analysis, which was conducted by management and reviewed by Semler Brossy, examined the potential risks in the design of our performance-based incentive compensation arrangements. As part of this assessment, we analyzed the mix of fixed and variable compensation; the mix of short- and long-term compensation; the mix of long-term equity incentives; performance metric mix; weighting, measurement and payout timing; discretion and caps on short-term incentives; award size, vesting schedules and performance and other terms of long-term equity incentives; and other incentive opportunities and their features. We also analyzed our recovery of incentive awards policy, executive stock ownership guidelines and hedging and pledging prohibitions. Finally, we evaluated on a combined basis the results of the enterprise and compensation risk assessments, on a business area-by-business area basis. 
The Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the findings of this analysis with management and concluded that it continues to believe that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The following provides information about the terms of our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, 2018 Performance Share Programs and our 2011 LTIP, pursuant to which our NEOs were awarded short- and long-term incentive compensation, as applicable and detailed in the tables above. For additional information regarding the application of these plans and programs to our NEOs in 2018, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis. 
   2018 Annual Bonus Plan  
Our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee and was established under our 2011 LTIP. The plan year for our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan ran from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Generally, all U.S. salaried employees not eligible for commissions under sales compensation plans and certain international and expatriate/inpatriate employees selected for participation are eligible to participate in our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, provided they have at least two full months of service during the plan year. Participants generally must be employed with us on the date payments are made in order to receive awards under the plan. However, in the event of death or retirement or certain involuntary terminations without cause, in each case, as described in the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, participants may receive their performance incentive awards for the year on a prorated basis based on the percentage of the year the participant was employed by us and eligible to participate. Participants who have at least two months of eligibility but less than a full year similarly may receive awards under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan on a prorated basis. 
   Target Incentive Award Opportunity  
Each participant is provided with a target incentive award opportunity under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary. For a discussion of the 2018 target incentive award opportunities for our NEOs, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis sections titled "Individual Target Incentive Award Opportunity" and "2018 Annual Bonus Plan Awards Paid to Our NEOs." Table of Contents
   Company Performance Funds Total Bonus Pool  
Company Performance Metrics and Weighting. Under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, after year-end a single Company-wide annual bonus pool (Total Bonus Pool) is funded based on the Company's performance measured against important Company-level financial performance metric targets. For 2018, our Compensation Committee selected adjusted EPS and adjusted net sales as our Company-level performance metrics. Each metric has a 50% weighting. 
Company Metrics Defined. For purposes of our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan: (i) adjusted EPS equals adjusted net income (loss) divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the performance year (adjusted net income (loss) equals GAAP net income (loss) excluding certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income, including, but not limited to, amortization expense, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges (credits), restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), litigation-related net charges (credits), certain investment impairment charges and discrete tax items); and (ii) adjusted net sales is calculated at an assumed standard constant currency basis that excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which are highly variable and difficult to predict, and other adjustments. 
For a discussion of the Company level targets under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, funding of the Total Bonus Pool and the individual performance component of the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled "Short-Term Incentives." 
   Clawback of Annual Bonus Plan Award  
Our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan provides that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our Board will seek reimbursement of incentive compensation paid to any executive officer under the plan in the event of a restatement of our financial results that reduced a previously granted award's size or payment. Under such circumstances, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we would seek to recover the amount of the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan award paid to such executive that was in excess of the amount that would have been paid based on the restated financial results. Additionally, our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan provides that to the extent permitted by applicable law, our Board may seek reimbursement of incentive compensation paid to an executive under the plan in the event of executive misconduct or gross dereliction of duty that resulted in a material violation of Company policy and caused significant harm to the Company. In such an event, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may seek reimbursement of all or a portion of cash incentive compensation awards paid within a certain time period under the plan. 
   2018 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program  
Our 2018 TSR PSP is administered, and the TSR performance-based DSUs awarded pursuant to our 2018 TSR PSP are granted, under our 2011 LTIP. The TSR performance-based DSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both the Company performance criteria and service criteria under the 2018 TSR PSP, subject to acceleration in the event of certain qualifying terminations discussed below. Our executives, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate in the 2018 TSR PSP, which is administered by our Compensation Committee. For a discussion of the TSR performance-based DSUs awarded to our NEOs in 2018, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled "2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards for our NEOs." Table of Contents 
   Company Performance Criteria  
For a discussion of the Company performance criteria under the 2018 TSR PSP, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled  "2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards for our NEOs."
Calculation of TSR and Percentile Performance. The TSR for the Company and each other company in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index for the three-year performance period is determined based on the following formula: 
(Change in Stock Price + Dividends Paid) / Beginning Stock Price 
The change in stock price is determined by subtracting the beginning stock price (the daily average closing price of one share of common stock for the two calendar months prior to the beginning of the performance period) from the ending stock price (the daily average closing price of one share of common stock for the last two calendar months of the performance period). The dividends paid are the total of all cash dividends paid on one share of common stock during the performance period. 
Following the calculation of the TSR for the three-year performance period for our Company and each of the other companies in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index, the companies will be ranked in order of maximum to minimum TSRs for the full three-year performance period. Our percentile performance will be determined by (i) dividing (a) our ranking versus that of the other companies in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index minus one, by (b) the total number of companies in the S&P 500 Healthcare Index minus one, and (ii) subtracting the result from one. 
   Service Criteria  
Generally under the 2018 TSR PSP, except with respect to termination of employment due to retirement, death or disability, or in connection with a change in control, in each case, as described in the 2018 TSR PSP and/or the 2011 LTIP, a participant must be employed with us on December 31, 2020 to be eligible to receive shares of our common stock in respect of his or her TSR performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied. 
For information regarding potential payments upon certain terminations of employment or in connection with a change in control, please see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
   2018 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program  
Our 2018 FCF PSP is administered, and the FCF performance-based DSUs awarded pursuant to our 2018 FCF PSP are granted, under our 2011 LTIP. The 2018 grants of FCF performance-based DSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both the one-year Company performance criteria and the three-year service criteria (inclusive of the performance period) under the 2018 FCF PSP, subject to acceleration in the event of certain qualifying terminations discussed below. Our executives, including our NEOs, were eligible to participate under the 2018 FCF PSP, which is administered by our Compensation Committee. For a discussion of the 2018 FCF performance-based DSUs awarded to our NEOs and the Company's achievement of the Company performance criteria under the program, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled "2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards for our NEOs."

   2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan  
Employees, directors and other individuals who provide services to us and our affiliates who, in the opinion of the Compensation Committee, are in a position to make a significant contribution to our success or that of our affiliates are eligible for Awards under our 2011 LTIP. The purpose of the broad-based equity incentive award opportunities available for grant under our 2011 LTIP is to attract, retain, engage and focus key employees and other eligible participants on achieving long-term stockholder value by rewarding them for the increased performance of our common stock underlying such awards. Our 2011 LTIP is administered by our Compensation Committee and provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock, deferred stock units, options to acquire our common stock, stock appreciation rights (SARs), performance awards and other stock and non-stock awards (collectively, Awards). Our 2011 LTIP prohibits repricing or replacement of options or SARs and the issuance of in-the-money options or SARs, and includes limitations on the amounts of grants and payments to any individual within a given year as well as certain other customary limitations. Our 2011 LTIP will terminate on March 1, 2021 (unless terminated sooner by our Board), and no further Awards may be granted following that date. 
Generally, the DSUs granted to our executives, including our NEOs, vest in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued service on each applicable vesting date, and stock options vest in four equal annual installments, subject to continued service on each applicable vesting date. The stock options that we granted to our executives expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. 
   Certain Separations from Service  
Generally under the 2011 LTIP, except with respect to termination of employment due to retirement, death or disability, or in connection with a change in control, in each case, as described therein or as otherwise provided for in the applicable award agreement, all equity awards terminate to the extent not vested immediately prior to the cessation of employment, and to the extent vested but not exercised at such time, remain exercisable for the lesser of one year or until the expiration of the stated term of the award. Further, in the event of a termination for "cause" (defined as conviction of, or a failure to contest prosecution for, a felony, or misconduct or dishonesty that is harmful to our business or reputation), or as a result of reasons that cast such discredit on the individual as to justify immediate termination of the award, in each case, as determined in the Compensation Committee's  Table of Contents sole discretion, all outstanding equity awards (including unexercised stock options, whether vested or unvested) terminate immediately upon notice of such termination. 
For a discussion of our plans and arrangements under which a change in control and/or termination of employment triggers payments or benefits, including our 2011 LTIP, please see the narrative to the tables appearing in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." Potential payments to our NEOs in 2018 under such plans or arrangements are included in the tables appearing in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
   2018 Equity Awards  
With respect to our executives, including our NEOs as applicable, our Compensation Committee set the mix of equity award opportunities under our 2018 Long-Term Incentive Program at 25% target TSR performance-based DSUs, 25% target FCF performance-based DSUs, 25% stock options and 25% service-based DSUs. The service-based DSUs vest in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued service on each applicable vesting date and except as set forth under "Certain Separations from Service." For a discussion of the 2018 equity awards made to our NEOs, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled "Long-Term Incentives."

   Defined Benefit Retirement Plan   
[END TABLE]
All of our executive officers, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate in our defined benefit Executive Retirement Plan, as amended effective August 1, 2016. The Executive Retirement Plan is a defined benefit plan that is intended to provide a clear and consistent approach to managing retirement-eligible executive departures with a standard, mutually understood separation and post-employment relationship. The plan provides retiring executives with a lump sum benefit of 2.5 months of salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of 36 months' pay. The lump sum payments are made in the first payroll period after the last day of the six-month period following retirement. Receipt of payment is conditioned upon the retiring employee entering into a separation agreement with us that includes a release of claims and customary non-disclosure, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement clauses in favor of the Company. The plan provides that in the event the executive breaches the non-competition or non-solicitation provision of his or her separation agreement, the executive must, in addition to any other court-ordered relief, repay to the Company all amounts paid under the plan. 
To receive benefits under the plan, upon his or her retirement an executive's age plus his or her years of service with us must exceed 65 years (provided that the executive is at least 55 years old and has been employed by us for at least five years). For purposes of the plan, "retirement" means any separation from service (as defined in the plan) other than a termination for "cause" (defined as conviction of, or failure to contest prosecution for, a felony, or misconduct or dishonesty that is harmful to our business or reputation). In addition, if an executive dies and is otherwise eligible for benefits under the plan on the date of his or her death, benefits under the plan will be paid within 60 days of the executive's death. 
For retirement-eligible NEOs (Messrs. Fitzgerald and Pierce), the present value of accrued benefits is calculated as the value of their lump sum benefit under the plan based on the NEO's base salary, age and number of years of credited service as of December 31, 2018. For NEOs who were not eligible for retirement (Messrs. Mahoney, Brennan and Ballinger) as of December 31, 2018, the present value of accrued benefits is calculated based on the respective NEO's base salary, age and number of years of  Table of Contents credited service as of December 31, 2018, discounted to December 31, 2018 from the earliest retirement eligibility date, using a discount rate of 4% per year. This valuation methodology is consistent with the methodology we use for financial statement accounting purposes, except that NEOs are assumed to remain employed by us until their earliest retirement age under the plan (or their age on December 31, if eligible for retirement on that date). For financial statement accounting purposes, the valuation considers the probability that the executives will achieve retirement age. For a more detailed description of the assumptions used in valuing accrued benefits under the plan, please see Note A — Significant Accounting Policies to our 2018 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to each of our NEOs, including the numbers of years of service credited to each NEO, under our Executive Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2018.

   Nonqualified Deferred Compensation   
[END TABLE]
The Boston Scientific Corporation Deferred Bonus Plan (the Deferred Bonus Plan) provides certain of our management, including our NEOs, an opportunity to defer a portion of their annual award under our Annual Bonus Plan. The Deferred Bonus Plan provides participants the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their annual award under our Annual Bonus Plan until the earlier of (i) termination of employment or (ii) an elected distribution date, such election to be made by June 30th of each year. Investment choices under the plan are generally the same as those under our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, except that, among other things, participants may not elect to invest in the BSC Stock Fund. Distributions under the plan are in either lump sum payments or annual installments over a period of two to five years, as specified by the participant. Under the Deferred Bonus Plan, Messrs. Ballinger and Fitzgerald elected to defer 75% of their 2016, 2017 and 2018 Annual Bonus Plan Awards. 
In September 2004, we committed to fund a special one-time contribution to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for the benefit of our employees. In June 2005, we adopted an Excess Benefit Plan, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan designed to provide specific supplemental benefits to those employees who would have exceeded the 2004 Code contribution limits if the special contribution had been made to their 401(k) plan accounts. Accordingly, the historic Excess Benefit Plan was established to accept the "overflow" contributions resulting from the special one-time contribution on behalf of participating employees, including certain of our NEOs. Investment choices under the historic Excess Benefit Plan are generally the same as those under our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, except that,  Table of Contents among other things, executive officers may not elect to invest in the BSC Stock Fund. The investment elections are made by each participant and may be changed daily. Generally, a lump sum cash payment of their respective account balances under the plan is made to participants determined to be "specified employees," including certain of our NEOs, commencing no earlier than six months and one day following their "separation from service." 
The table below shows the aggregate earnings and balances for each of our NEOs under our historic Excess Benefit Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan as of December 31, 2018. 
The investment choices under the historic Excess Benefit Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan and their annual rates of return for the year ended December 31, 2018 are contained in the following table.

   Executive Retirement Plan  
All of our executives, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate in our Executive Retirement Plan. The Executive Retirement Plan is intended to provide a clear and consistent approach to managing executive departures with a standard mutually-understood separation and post-employment  Table of Contents relationship. The benefits payable to our executives upon "retirement" under the Executive Retirement Plan, as well as the present value of amounts accrued thereunder as of December 31, 2018, are reflected in the table and the related footnotes and narrative to the section titled "Defined Benefit Retirement Plan." In addition, changes in the present value of the benefits under the Executive Retirement Plan from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 are reflected in the "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings" column of the Summary Compensation Table. For further discussion of our Executive Retirement Plan, please see the footnotes and narrative to the table appearing in the section titled "Defined Benefit Retirement Plan." 
   Change in Control Agreements  
We have entered into Change in Control Agreements with our executives, including our NEOs, and other key employees. Our Change in Control Agreements for our executives are limited to a three-year term and provide that if both a change in control occurs during the term of the agreement and the executive's employment is terminated either by us without "Cause" or by the executive for "Good Reason" (each as described below) during the two-year period following the change in control, then the executive would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment of three times the sum of (i) the executive's base salary and (ii) target incentive bonus (or prior year's bonus, if higher). Additionally, an executive would be entitled to receive a prorated target incentive bonus for the year in which his or her termination occurred, continuation of health, life insurance and other welfare benefits for up to three years, and reimbursement for up to $100,000 in legal fees and expenses incurred by an executive in disputing termination or enforcing rights under his or her Change in Control Agreement. Our Change in Control Agreements further provide that all equity awards granted to executives require both a change in control and a termination without Cause or resignation by the executive for Good Reason within two years after the change in control in order to accelerate vesting; provided, however, that if the surviving or acquiring entity in a change in control transaction does not provide for the substitution or assumption of outstanding equity awards, such outstanding awards will immediately become fully vested. 
The Change in Control Agreements include a "best net" provision that requires a reduction in the amount of the severance paid to an executive if the reduction would result in a greater after-tax amount. In exchange for the benefits afforded under our Change in Control Agreements, our executives agree to certain non-disclosure restrictions, a two-year non-solicitation obligation and to execute and not revoke a release in favor of the Company. Executives, including our NEOs, who receive payments under our Change in Control Agreements cannot also receive payments and benefits under our Executive Retirement Plan or Severance Plan For Exempt Employees (the Severance Plan). 
For purposes of our Change in Control Agreements, "Cause" generally means willfully engaging in criminal or fraudulent acts or gross misconduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to us. "Good Reason" generally means, among other things, assignment of duties inconsistent with the executive's status as an executive or an adverse alteration of the executive's duties; a reduction in annual base salary or bonus or failure to increase salary at a rate commensurate with that of other key executives; an adverse change in long-term incentive opportunities; failure by the Company to continue to provide comparable benefits or continue in effect, or continue the executive's participation in, any compensation plan in which the executive participates; the relocation of the executive's principal place of work more than 50 miles; or failure by the Company to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor entity to agree to perform the Change in Control Agreement.  Table of Contents
   Long-Term Incentive Plan  
Equity awards granted to our executives under our 2011 LTIP require both a change in control and a subsequent termination without Cause or for Good Reason pursuant to the terms of our Change in Control Agreements for accelerated vesting where the surviving or acquiring entity assumes outstanding awards. 
The terms of all service-based DSUs granted in 2018 to our employees, including our NEOs, provide that in the event that the employee's employment terminates: 
Our 2011 LTIP is more fully described under the section titled "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan." 
   TSR Performance Share Programs  
Our TSR PSPs cover our executives, including our NEOs, and are administered by the Compensation Committee. Under our 2016 TSR PSP, if a participant's employment terminates due to retirement, death or disability prior to the end of the three-year performance period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the TSR performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period, on a prorated basis through the date of retirement, death or disability. Under our 2017 and 2018 TSR PSPs, if a participant's employment terminates due to death or disability prior to the end of the three-year performance period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the TSR performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period as if the participant had been employed until the end of the three-year performance period. Under our 2017 and 2018 TSR PSPs, if a participant's employment terminates due to retirement after December 31 in the year of grant and prior to the end of the three-year performance period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the TSR performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period, on a prorated basis through the date of retirement; however, such awards will be forfeited in their entirety in the event that retirement occurs prior to December 31 in the year of grant. 
Pursuant to the terms of our Change in Control Agreements, the TSR performance-based DSUs awarded to our executives require both a change in control and a subsequent termination without Cause or for Good Reason for accelerated vesting where the surviving or acquiring entity assumes outstanding awards. Under our TSR PSPs and our Change in Control Agreements, if a change in control and a subsequent termination without Cause or for Good Reason occurs after December 31 in the year of grant, but prior to the end of the three-year performance period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the TSR performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied on the last day of the month preceding the date on which the change in control is consummated, on a prorated basis.

Our 2018 TSR PSP is more fully described under the section titled "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — 2018 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Program." 
   FCF Performance Share Programs  
Our FCF PSPs cover our executives, including our NEOs, and are administered by our Compensation Committee. Under our 2016 FCF PSPs, if a participant's employment terminates due to retirement, death or disability after the end of the one-year performance period but prior to the end of the three-year service period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the FCF performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied, on a prorated basis through the date of retirement, death or disability. Under our 2017 and 2018 FCF PSPs, if a participant's employment terminates (i) due to retirement after the end of the one-year performance period but prior to the end of the three-year service period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the FCF performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied, on a prorated basis through the date of retirement (however, such awards will be forfeited in their entirety in the event that retirement occurs prior to the end of the one-year performance period), or (ii) due to death or disability at any time before the end of the three-year service period, shares of our common stock will be issued in respect of the FCF performance-based DSUs as to which the performance criteria under the program have been satisfied as if the participant had been employed until the end of the three-year service period. 
Pursuant to the terms of our Change in Control Agreements, the FCF performance-based DSUs awarded to our executives require both a change in control and a subsequent termination without Cause or for Good Reason for accelerated vesting where the surviving or acquiring entity assumes outstanding awards. However, such awards will be forfeited in their entirety in the event of a change of control that occurs prior to the end of the one-year performance period. 
Our 2018 FCF PSP is more fully described under the section titled "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — 2018 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program." 
   2018 Annual Bonus Plan  
Our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan is generally available to all U.S. salaried personnel not eligible for commissions under sales compensation plans, including our NEOs, and certain international and expatriate/inpatriate employees working in positions designated by the Company as eligible to participate in the plan. To be eligible to receive their incentive award, participants generally must be employed by us on the date payments are made under the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan. However, in the event of death, retirement or certain involuntary terminations without cause, in each case, as described in the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan, participants may receive their performance incentive awards for the year on a prorated basis based on the percentage of the year the participant was employed by us and eligible to participate (subject to certain minimum months of service requirements). Grants of performance incentive awards to our NEOs under our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column, and our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan is more fully described under the section titled "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — 2018 Annual Bonus Plan," as well as the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section titled "Short-Term Incentives." Table of Contents
   Severance Plans  
We maintain severance plans for eligible employees, including our NEOs, under which participants are entitled to receive certain payments and benefits for specified periods of time following a qualifying termination. Such benefits are only available in the event of certain involuntary terminations either (i) due to an anticipated facility relocation or closing or a reduction of staffing levels where the employee has not refused a similar position with us, or (ii) resulting from a sale, merger or reorganization of our Company where the employee is not provided an opportunity to be employed in a similar position with the acquiring or resulting entity. Executives, including our NEOs, who are eligible to receive payments under our Executive Retirement Plan or who receive severance payments under a Change in Control Agreement are not also eligible to receive payments and benefits under our severance plans. 
The Severance Plan provides that director level and above exempt employees, including certain of our NEOs, are eligible for: 
Additionally, the Severance Plan provides that, in the event of certain involuntary terminations, employees eligible to participate in our Annual Bonus Plan may be entitled to a prorated bonus if such involuntary termination occurs on or after October 1 of a calendar year. The prorated bonus is calculated by multiplying the amount of the bonus an employee would have received for the calendar year, had he or she remained employed by the Company until the bonus payment date (or, if less, the target bonus) (Bonus), times a fraction, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Bonus     ×   number of days in which employee was bonus eligible during calendar year          number of days in the calendar year 
[END TABLE]
Under the Severance Plan, the payment of severance benefits is subject to the Company's receipt of a release of claims. In addition, the maximum severance payment available under the plan is limited to twice the Code dollar limitation in effect for qualified plans for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the termination occurs. 
The following tables show potential payments to Messrs. Mahoney, Brennan, Ballinger, Fitzgerald and Pierce under existing agreements, plans or other arrangements, for various scenarios involving a change in control or termination of employment, in each case assuming the termination was effective before the end of the day on December 31, 2018 and, where applicable, using the closing market price of our common stock of $35.34 per share on December 31, 2018. In each case, amounts in these tables do not include amounts payable, if any, to our NEOs who were not retirement eligible on December 31, 2018 pursuant to our Executive Retirement Plan, which are described in the table and accompanying narrative and footnotes in the section titled "Defined Benefit Retirement Plan."

   CEO Pay Ratio   
[END TABLE]
We strive to pay our employees competitively compared to similar positions in the applicable labor market. We follow that approach worldwide, whether for an executive position or an hourly job at a local facility. We take into account location, job level and pay grade, time with us and time in current role, experience and skill set, and adjust compensation annually to match the applicable market. By doing so, we believe we maintain a high-quality, stable workforce. We determined the compensation we paid to the median employee in accordance with this philosophy. 
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to our median employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to Michael F. Mahoney, our CEO. The following paragraphs describe our methodology and the resulting CEO Pay Ratio. 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees (other than our CEO) was estimated to be approximately 224 to 1.  Table of Contents
The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the "median employee" and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by us, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees and the annual total compensation of the median employee, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used were as follows: Table of Contents 
  PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE   NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION     
Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Our Board has determined to provide our stockholders this opportunity on an annual basis and we expect the next vote to be held at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
As described in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, our executive compensation philosophy is to provide appropriate competitive compensation opportunities to our executives with actual pay outcomes heavily influenced by the achievement of Company performance targets and individual performance objectives (in other words, "pay for performance") in support of our business strategy and creation of long-term stockholder value. 
   Executive Compensation Program Best Practices  
Our Compensation Committee believes that a strong foundation for our compensation program is necessary to execute our executive compensation philosophy effectively. The following key aspects of executive compensation best practices serve as the foundation for our compensation program:  Table of Contents
   Pay for Performance  
We believe our emphasis on at-risk, performance-based incentive compensation — consisting of our Annual Bonus Plan awards and long-term equity awards — aligns our executives with our business strategy and the short- and long-term interests of our stockholders, providing "pay for performance" and putting a significant portion of our executives' pay "at risk." 
   A Significant Portion of our NEOs' 2018 Target TDC is At-Risk, Performance-Based Compensation  
Our Compensation Committee ties a significant portion of the primary elements of our executives' target TDC to at-risk, performance-based incentive opportunities. For 2018, approximately 91% of the target value of the primary elements of TDC for our CEO and approximately 81% of the target value of the primary elements of TDC for our other NEOs as a group consisted of at-risk, performance-based incentive compensation. For additional details and a breakdown of at-risk, performance-based incentive compensation, please see the Compensation Discussion & Analysis sections titled "A Significant Portion of our NEOs' 2018 Target TDC is At-Risk, Performance-Based Compensation" and "Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation, Primary Elements of Total Direct Compensation." 
Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion." 
While the vote is advisory in nature, which means that it is non-binding on us, our Compensation Committee values the opinions of our stockholders and will take into consideration the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. We currently conduct annual advisory votes on executive compensation, and therefore we intend to hold the next advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE   "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE   OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT   PURSUANT TO ITEM 402 OF REGULATION S-K.      Table of Contents
  PROPOSAL 3: AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF OUR BY-LAWS TO   PROVIDE FOR A MAJORITY VOTE STANDARD IN UNCONTESTED   DIRECTOR ELECTIONS     
In February 2019, our Board voted unanimously to approve, subject to stockholder approval, and to recommend to our stockholders that they approve, an amendment and restatement of our By-Laws to implement a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections. 
   Current Plurality Vote Standard  
Our By-Laws currently provide that our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of directors. Under this plurality vote standard, the director nominees who receive the highest number of affirmative votes cast are elected as directors until all board seats are filled. In an uncontested director election, where the number of nominees and available board seats are equal, every nominee is elected as long as they get any "FOR" votes. As a result, a director may be elected without receiving a majority of votes cast "FOR" his or her election and even if the number of "WITHHELD" votes exceeds the number of "FOR" votes. 
   Rationale for Implementation of Majority Vote Standard  
Majority voting in uncontested director elections has become a corporate governance best practice. A substantial majority of companies in the S&P 500 have adopted the majority vote standard in uncontested elections. Under a majority vote standard, even if a director election is uncontested, a director must receive at least a majority of votes cast "FOR" his or her election to be elected. As a part of the Board's ongoing review of our corporate governance and as a result of engagement with our stockholders, our Board believes that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to implement a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections. Our Board believes that the adoption of this amendment will enhance the Board's accountability to our stockholders. 
Most companies that adopt the majority vote standard in uncontested elections retain the plurality vote standard in contested director elections. In a contested election, where there are more director nominees than the number of director positions open for election, the dispersion of votes among the various director nominees may make it difficult, if not impossible, for a director to receive a majority of votes regardless of whether such nominee is supported by our Board or a third party. As a result, fewer candidates could be elected to the Board than the number of authorized Board seats, which would be disruptive to Board operations and interfere with the Board's ability to perform its duties to the Company and stockholders. 
Almost all companies that have adopted the majority vote standard for uncontested elections couple their voting standard with a resignation requirement for directors who do not achieve the required vote. This is because under Delaware law, a sitting director that is not properly reelected continues to serve on the board until a successor director is duly elected, and is referred to as a "holdover" director. The resignation requirement ensures that the board can evaluate the circumstances relating to the vote and easily replace the director in question by accepting the resignation, while ensuring timely disclosure to shareholders concerning the Board's conclusions. We are also proposing amendments to our By-Laws to add a resignation policy as described below.  Table of Contents
Adopting a majority vote standard in uncontested elections therefore reinforces accountability to stockholders, while retaining a plurality vote standard in contested elections ensures that the Board is able to consistently and effectively serve stockholders. 
   Proposed Implementation of Majority Vote Standard  
The implementation of the majority vote standard requires the amendment of Article IV ("Board of Directors"), Section 2 ("Number, Qualification, Election and Terms") of our By-Laws. If approved by our stockholders, Article IV, Section 2 of our By-Laws will be revised as follows (additions are double underscored and deletions are struck through): 
Number, Qualification, Election and Terms. Except as otherwise fixed by, or pursuant to, the provisions of Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, the number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, but shall not be less than three nor more than twenty persons. Except as otherwise required by law, each nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast, in person or by proxy, by the holders of shares entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at any such meeting, as determined by the Secretary of the Corporation as of the record date for such meeting, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by proxy. For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast with respect to such nominee. In the event that a director nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in an election where the number of nominees is less than or equal to the number of directors to be elected, the Board of Directors, within its powers, may decrease the number of directors, fill the vacancy, or take other appropriate action. An abstention will not count as a vote cast with respect to a director. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.The Directors shall be elected by plurality vote annually by the stockholders at their annual meeting or at any special meeting the notice of which specifies the election of Directors as an item of business for such meeting. 
   Director Resignation  
Additionally, our Board also has approved amendments to our By-Laws to modify our existing director resignation policy to be consistent with the majority vote standard, contingent upon approval of this proposal. We are incorporated in Delaware, and under the Delaware General Corporation Law, an incumbent director who does not receive the vote required for re-election continues to serve as a "holdover director" until a successor is elected and qualified. The amended By-Laws would require each incumbent nominee who does not receive the majority vote in an uncontested election to promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. Our Board will then decide whether to accept the resignation (based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee) within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote, and will disclose  Table of Contents its determination and its reasoning either in a press release or an SEC filing. If approved by our stockholders, Article IV, Section 2 of our By-Laws will also be revised to add the following paragraph: 
If an incumbent director who is nominated for re-election to the Board of Directors does not receive sufficient "for" votes to be elected in accordance with this By-Law, the incumbent director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to the director's resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until the director's successor is duly elected, or the director's earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of Article IV of the By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of Article IV of the By-Laws. 
The text of our amended and restated By-Laws, including Article IV, Section 2 marked with the proposed changes, is attached as  Annex B to this Proxy Statement. 
   Effectiveness of Amendments  
If approved, the amendment and restatement of our By-Laws will become effective immediately following the Annual Meeting. The new majority vote standard would then be applicable to any uncontested election of directors occurring after the amendment and restatement becomes effective. 
If our stockholders do not approve the amendment and restatement of our By-Laws to implement a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections, the By-Laws will remain unchanged. 
   Vote Required  
Pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, the proposal to amend and restate our By-Laws must be approved by the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Your vote is very important. In 2012, the Board recommended a similar amendment, but we did not achieve the 80% vote threshold. We urge you to vote "FOR" this proposal. 
  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE   "FOR" THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF OUR BY-LAWS TO PROVIDE   FOR A MAJORITY VOTE STANDARD IN UNCONTESTED DIRECTOR ELECTIONS   AND THE RELATED DIRECTOR RESIGNATION REQUIREMENT.      Table of Contents

  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT     
The Audit Committee oversees our Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors and has other responsibilities as set forth in the Audit Committee charter, which is available on our website at www.bostonscientific.com under the "Investor Relations" section. Management has the primary responsibility for our Company's financial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young), our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2018, is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of our Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on our Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed with management and Ernst & Young the audited financial statements included in the Boston Scientific Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion about the quality, not just the acceptability, of our Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements, and Ernst & Young's evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters that are required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 1301,  Communications with Audit Committees. Ernst & Young has also provided the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young that firm's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that Ernst & Young's provision of audit and non-audit services to the Company and its affiliates is compatible with Ernst & Young's independence. 
The Audit Committee further discussed with the Company's internal auditors and Ernst & Young the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly with the internal auditors and Ernst & Young, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee approved the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has also approved the selection of Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
This Audit Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Boston Scientific filing with the SEC, except to the extent that Boston Scientific specifically incorporates this Report by reference into another Boston Scientific filing.

  PROPOSAL 4: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT   REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for approving the appointment, retention and compensation, and for the oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. Ernst & Young LLP has been retained as the Company's external auditor continuously since 1992. The Audit Committee is responsible for audit fee negotiations associated with the Company's retention of Ernst & Young LLP. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent external audit firm. In conjunction with the mandated rotation of the Audit Firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chair are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young LLP's new lead engagement partner. 
In making its determination regarding whether to appoint or retain a particular independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee takes into account the views of management and our internal auditors, and will take into account the vote of our stockholders with respect to the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its investors. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting and respond to questions and, if they desire, make a statement. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE   "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP   AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   FOR THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR.

In the event that you wish to revoke a householding consent you previously provided to a broker, you must contact that broker to revoke your consent. If you (i) are eligible for householding and you currently receive multiple copies of either our Notice or Proxy Statement and our Annual Report but you wish to receive only one copy of each of these documents for your household or (ii) you currently receive only one set of these documents due to householding and wish to revoke your consent for future mailings, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by mail at Householding Department, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717 or by telephone at (800) 542-1061.

   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures. To describe the relationship between pay and performance, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures used as performance metrics under certain of our short- and long-term incentive compensation plans and programs, including adjusted free cash flow, adjusted net sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. 
Adjusted free cash flow as used in our 2018 FCF PSP excludes the cash component of certain charges (credits) that are also excluded from adjusted EPS, as well as any cash tax benefits of such charges. In addition, we exclude tax settlements payments that relate to prior periods. The GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow on a GAAP basis. Free cash flow on a GAAP basis is calculated by subtracting net purchases of property, plant and equipment from cash provided by operating activities. Accordingly, management excluded or included these cash items for purposes of reviewing our cash flow performance in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure under our 2018 FCF PSP to facilitate an evaluation of our cash flow performance relative to our internal financial plan in accordance with the 2018 FCF PSP. 
Adjusted net sales as used in our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan excludes certain adjustments and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations included in our net sales to align with measures that are considered by management to evaluate performance relative to our operating plan. Management excluded the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which are highly variable and difficult to predict, by converting actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. Management included or excluded other net adjustments which were not contemplated at the time the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan was set. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net sales is net sales on a GAAP basis. 
Adjusted EPS excludes certain charges (credits) included in EPS on a GAAP basis as we believe these items are not indicative of future performance. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used to make operating decisions and assess their performance. Accordingly, management excluded these items in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure under our 2018 Annual Bonus Plan to facilitate an evaluation of our performance relative to our internal financial plan in accordance with the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan. In addition, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, adjusted EPS was further adjusted to remove one-time benefits not contemplated at the time the 2018 Annual Bonus Plan was approved. 
We believe that presenting the non-GAAP financial measures that are used as performance metrics under certain of our short- and long-term incentive compensation plans and programs, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to information relevant to the relationship between pay and performance and allows investors to see our results "through the eyes" of management.

Section 6.    Notice of Stockholder Business.    At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed to and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than 120 calendar days before the date of the corporation's proxy statement released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting. However, if the corporation did not hold an annual meeting the previous year, or if the date of the current year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year's meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the corporation begins to print and mail its proxy materials. 
A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (d) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.

Section 7.    Inspectors.    The Board of Directors shall appoint inspectors of election to act as judges of the voting and to determine those entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, in advance of such meeting, but if the Board of Directors fails to make such appointments or if an appointee fails to serve, the presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders may appoint substitute inspectors. 
Section 8.    Voting.    Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled at every meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of stock having voting power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books of the corporation on the record date for the meeting and such votes may be cast either in person or by written proxy. Every proxy must be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the corporation. The vote upon any question brought before a meeting of the stockholders may be by voice vote, unless otherwise required by these By-Laws or unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Every vote taken by written ballot shall be counted by the inspectors of election. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock which has voting power present in person or represented by proxy and which has actually voted shall decide any question properly brought before such meeting, except the election or removal of Directors or as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation or a Preferred Stock Designation or by applicable law. With respect to any election or questions required to be decided by any class of stock voting as a class, the vote of the holders of a majority of such class of stock present in person or by proxy and which actually voted shall decide any such election or question. 
Section 9.    Order of Business.    Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting of stockholders, by ascertaining whether any stockholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and by determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders. 
  ARTICLE III   NOMINATION OF DIRECTOR CANDIDATES
Section 1.    Notification of Nominees.    Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally. However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as Directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the corporation not later 120 calendar days before the date of the corporation's proxy statement released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting. However, if the corporation did not hold an annual meeting the previous year, or if the date of the current year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the 
B-3
Table of Contents previous year's meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the corporation begins to print and mail its proxy materials. 
If the nomination or nominations is for a meeting of stockholders other than a regularly scheduled annual meeting, the deadline is a reasonable time before the corporation begins to print and mail its proxy material. 
Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (d) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of the corporation if so elected. 
Section 2.    Substitution of Nominees.    If a person is validly designated as a nominee in accordance with Section 1 of this Article III, and shall thereafter become unable or unwilling to stand for election to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or the stockholder who proposed such nominee, as the case may be, may designate a substitute nominee upon delivery, not fewer than five days prior to the date of the meeting for the election of such nominee, of a written notice to the Secretary setting forth such information regarding such substitute nominee as would have been required to be delivered to the Secretary pursuant to Section 1 of this Article III, had such substitute nominee been initially proposed as a nominee. Such notice shall include a signed consent to serve as a Director of the corporation, if elected, of each substitute nominee. 
Section 3.    Compliance with Procedures.    If the presiding officer of the meeting for the election or Directors determines that a nomination for any candidate for election as a Director at such meeting was not made in accordance with the applicable provisions of these By-Laws, such person will not be eligible for election as a Director and such nomination shall be void; provided, however, that nothing in these By-Laws shall be deemed to limit any voting rights upon the occurrence of dividend arrearages provided to holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Preferred Stock Designation for any series of Preferred Stock. 
  ARTICLE IV   BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Section 1.    Powers.    The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. 
Section 2.    Number, Qualification, Election and Terms.    Except as otherwise fixed by, or pursuant to, the provisions of Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, the number of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, but shall not be less than three nor more than twenty persons. Except as otherwise required by law, each nominee for director 
B-4
Table of Contents shall be elected to the Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast, in person or by proxy, by the holders of shares entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at any such meeting, as determined by the Secretary of the Corporation as of the record date for such meeting, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by proxy. For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast with respect to such nominee. In the event that a director nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in an election where the number of nominees is less than or equal to the number of directors to be elected, the Board of Directors, within its powers, may decrease the number of directors, fill the vacancy, or take other appropriate action. An abstention will not count as a vote cast with respect to a director. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. The Directors shall be elected by plurality vote annually by the stockholders at their annual meeting or at any special meeting the notice of which specifies the election of Directors as an item of business for such meeting. 
If an incumbent director who is nominated for re-election to the Board of Directors does not receive sufficient "for" votes to be elected in accordance with this By-Law, the incumbent director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to the director's resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until the director's successor is duly elected, or the director's earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of Article IV of the By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of Article IV of the By-Laws. 
Section 3.    Removal.    Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, any Director may be removed from office by the stockholders in the manner provided in this Section 3 of Article IV. At any annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation or at any special meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, the notice of which shall state that the removal of a Director or Directors is among the purposes of the meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined below), voting together as a single class, may remove, with or without cause, such Director or Directors. For the purposes of these By-Laws, "Voting Stock" shall mean the outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors.

Except as otherwise fixed by or provided for or pursuant to the provisions of Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect additional Directors under specified circumstances, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in office though less than quorum, or by a sole remaining Director, except as may be required by law. Any Director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. 
Section 5.    Regular Meetings.    Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of the stockholders and at such other time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. 
Section 6.    Special Meetings and Notice.    Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, or, if there is no Chief Executive Officer, the President, on one day's written notice to each Director by whom such notice is not waived, given either personally or by mail, telephone, telegram, telex, facsimile or similar medium of communication, and shall be called by the Chief Executive Officer, or, if there is no Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of any three Directors. 
Section 7.    Resignation.    Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his resignation to the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary, to be effective upon its acceptance by the Board of Directors or at the time specified in such notice. Unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make such resignation effective. 
Section 8.    Quorum.    Subject to Section 4 of this Article IV and except as provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, at all meetings of Directors, a majority of the total number of Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except for the designation of committees (as provided in Section 9 of this Article IV), the vote of a majority of Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, a majority of the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time to another place, time or date, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. 
Section 9.    Committees.    The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the Whole Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the Directors of the corporation, which to the extent provided in such resolution shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management and affairs of the corporation and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it, except as otherwise limited by statute. The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Directors when required. Each committee of the Board of Directors may fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by such rules, except as may otherwise be provided by the resolution of the Board of Directors designating such committee, and unless otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, the presence of at least a majority of the members of such committee shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.

Section 10.    Compensation.    The Directors may be paid for expenses of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary.

Members of committees designated by the Board of Directors may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings. 
Section 11.    Rules.    The Board of Directors may adopt such special rules and regulations for the conduct of their meetings and the management of the affairs of the corporation as they may deem proper, not inconsistent with law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.

Any number of offices may be held by the same person. In its discretion, the Board of Directors may choose not to fill any office for any period as it may deem advisable, except the offices of the president and secretary.

Each officer shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the Board of Directors or until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal as hereinafter provided. 
Section 3.    Removal.

  ARTICLE VI   INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS
 Section 1.    The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as director, officer, employee or other agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonable believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. 
 Section 2.    The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as director or officer of another corporation, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonable entitled to indemnification for such expenses which the court shall deem proper. 
 Section 3.    To the extent that an officer of the corporation or person serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VI or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith. 
 Section 4.    Any indemnification under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VI (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the officer or person serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VI. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not 
B-9
Table of Contents parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders. 
 Section 5.    Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or person serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this Article VI. 
 Section 6.    The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in other capacity while holding such office. 
 Section 7.    The corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI. 
 Section 8.    For purposes of this Article VI, references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors and officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 
 Section 9.    The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an officer, employee or person serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 
 Section 10.    This Article VI may be amended or repealed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Voting Stock; provided that no such amendment or repeal shall adversely affect any right to indemnification for any act or omission of any person referred to in Section 1 and 2 of this Article VI which occurred or allegedly occurred prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal. 
 Section 11.    If in any action, suit or other proceeding or investigation, a Director of the corporation is held not liable for monetary damages because that Director is relieved of personal liability under Article NINTH of the Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise, the Director shall be deemed to have met the standards of conduct set forth above and to be entitled to indemnification as provided above.

  ARTICLE VII   CERTIFICATES OF STOCK
Section 1.    Form.    Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, (1) the President or a Vice-President and (2) the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him or her in the corporation. Where a certificate is signed (1) by a transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the corporation or its employee, the signature of any such President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary may be facsimile. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation. 
Section 2.    Lost Certificates.    The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 
Section 3.    Fixing a Record Date.    Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date, not more than sixty nor less than ten days preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining any consent, as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting, and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect to any such change, conversion, or exchange of capital stock, or to give such consent, and in such case such stockholders and only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid. If no record date is fixed, the time for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. The time for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
