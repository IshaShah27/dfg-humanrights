Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
No director or executive officer, or person nominated or chosen to become a director or executive officer, was involved in any legal proceeding requiring disclosure.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE INFORMATION
Board of Directors
Santa Fe is an unlisted company and a "smaller reporting company" under rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The majority of its Board of Directors consists of "independent" directors as independence is defined by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The Board of Directors held two meetings during the 2018 Fiscal Year (in person, telephonically or by written consent). No Director attended (whether in person, telephonically, or by written consent) less than 75% of all meetings held during the period of time he or she served as Director during the 2018 Fiscal Year.
Board Leadership Structure 
The Chairman of the Board, Mr. Winfield, also serves as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that combining the Chairman and Chief Executive officer roles is the most appropriate structure for the Company at this time because (i) this structure has had a longstanding history with the Company, which the Board believes has served our stockholders well through many economic cycles and business challenges; (ii) the Board believes Mr. Winfield's unique business experience and history with the Company makes it appropriate for him to serve in both capacities; and (iii) the Board believes its corporate government processes and committee structures preserve Board independence by insuring independent discussions among directors and independent evaluation of, and communications with, members of senior management such that separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles is unnecessary at this time.
The Board of Directors has not established a formal process for security holders to send communications to the Board of Directors and the Board has not deemed it necessary to establish such a procedure at this time. Historically, almost all communications that the Company receives from security holders are administrative in nature and are not directed to the Board of Directors. If the Company should receive a security holder communication directed to the Board of Directors, or to an individual director, said communication will be relayed to the Board of Directors or the individual director as the case may be.
The Company does not have any formal policy with regard to board members attendance at annual meetings of shareholders but encourages each director to attend said meetings. All of the Company's directors attended the Fiscal 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.
Committees
Santa Fe has established two standing committees, a Securities Investment Committee (the "Securities Investment Committee") and an Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee"). The Company does not have any standing nominating or compensation committees of the Board of Directors. Executive compensation is determined by the independent members of the Board. New director nominations, if any, will be considered and determined by the Board of Directors. The Company has no policy with regard to consideration of any director candidates recommended by security holders. As a small business issuer that has approximately 85% of its voting securities controlled by one shareholder, the Company has not deemed it appropriate to institute such a policy.
Audit Committee. Santa Fe is a smaller reporting company under SEC rules, and is not listed on a national securities exchange (as defined under SEC rules) and is rather traded on the OTC Market Inc.'s Pink Sheets. The Audit Committee is currently comprised of members Nance (Chairperson) and Love, each of whom are independent directors as independence is defined by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ, and as may be modified or supplemented. Each of these directors also meets the audit committee financial expert test based on their qualifications and business experience discussed above. The primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing: the financial reports provided by the Company to any governmental body or the public; the Company's system of internal controls regarding finance, accounting, legal compliance and ethics that management and the Board have established; and the Company's auditing, accounting and financial processes generally. The Audit Committee is responsible for the selection and retention of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee held four meetings during the 2018 fiscal year.
The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of that written charter, as amended, is posted on the Santa Fe page of the InterGroup website (www.intgla.com).
Securities Investment Committee. On March 17, 1998, the Company established the Securities Investment Committee to establish guidelines and to review the Company's investment policies. The Committee consists of all the members of the Board, with Mr. Winfield serving as Chairperson. During fiscal 2018, the Securities Investment Committee held three meetings.
Code of Ethics
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of the Code of Ethics is posted on the Santa Fe page of the InterGroup website (www.intgla.com). The Company will provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of the Code of Ethics by sending such request to: Santa Fe Financial Corporation, Attn: Treasurer, 11620 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 350, Los Angeles, CA 90025. The Company will promptly disclose any amendments or waivers to its Code of Ethics on Form 8-K and will post such information on its website.
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires the Company's officers and directors, and each beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the Common Stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten-percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were required for those persons, the Company believes that during fiscal 2018 all filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors, and greater than ten-percent beneficial owners were complied with.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As a smaller reporting company, Santa Fe has no compensation committee. Executive Officer compensation is set by independent members of the Board of Directors. The Board seeks to design and set compensation to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers and to align their interests with those of long-term owners of the Company. The Board has not engaged any compensation consultants in determining the amount or form of executive or director compensation, but does review and monitor published compensation surveys and studies. The Board may delegate to the Company's Chief Executive Officer the authority determine the compensation of certain executive officers.
Santa Fe has no stock option plan or stock appreciation rights for its executive officers. The Company has no pension or long-term incentive plans. There are no employment contracts between Santa Fe and any executive officer, and there are no termination-of-employment or change-in-control arrangements.
The following table provides certain summary information concerning compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to the Company's principal executive officer and other named executive officers of the Company whose total compensation exceeded $100,000 for all services rendered to the Company for each of the Company's last two competed fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.

In fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, the disinterested members of the Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary, Portsmouth, established a performance-based compensation program for the Company's Chief Executive Officer to keep and retain his services as a direct and active manager of the Company's securities portfolio. Pursuant to the current criteria established by the Board, Mr. Winfield is entitled to performance based compensation for his management of the Company's securities portfolio equal to 20% of all net investment gains generated in excess of an annual return equal to the Prime Rate of Interest (as published in the Wall Street Journal) plus 2%. Compensation amounts are calculated and paid quarterly based on the results of the Company's investment portfolio for that quarter. Should the Company have a net investment loss during any quarter, Mr. Winfield would not be entitled to any further performance-based compensation until any such investment losses are recouped by the Company. This performance based compensation program may be further modified or terminated at the discretion of the respective Boards of Directors. The Company's Chief Executive Officer did not earn any performance based compensation for the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End
The Company did not have any outstanding equity awards at the end of its fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and has no equity compensation plans in effect.
Internal Revenue Code Limitations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), provides that, in the case of a publicly held corporation, the corporation is not generally allowed to deduct remuneration paid to its chief executive officer and certain other highly compensated officers to the extent that such remuneration exceeds $1,000,000 for the taxable year.
SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
At its fiscal 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on March 3, 2017, the Company submitted to its shareholders two proposals regarding executive compensation. The first proposal to approve, in a non-binding vote, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers was approved by the shareholders, having received more than 99% of the shares voted at the meeting in favor of the proposal. The second proposal was to determine, in a non-binding vote, whether a shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's executive officers should occur every one, two or three years. The shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favor of three years as the frequency in which the Company should have an advisory vote on executive compensation with more than 99% of the shares voted at the meeting being in favor of three years. The Board of Directors considered the guidance provided by those advisory votes and set three years as the frequency in which it will have a non-binding vote on executive compensation.
The Board of Directors will continue to focus on responsible executive compensation practices that attract, motivate and retain high performance executives, reward those executives for the achievement of long-term performance and support our other executive compensation objectives.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The bylaws of Santa Fe permit directors to be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board or a stated salary as director. Each director is paid a fee of $1,500 per quarter for a total annual compensation of $6,000. This policy has been in effect since July 1, 1985. Members of the Audit Committee also receive a fee of $500 per quarter. Directors and committee members are also reimbursed for their out-of-pocket travel costs to attend meetings. The Board will review and may adjust director and committee compensation from time to time to assure that the Company can continue to attract and retain qualified directors.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
As of December 31, 2018, Santa Fe and InterGroup owned 82.3% of the common stock of Portsmouth, and InterGroup and John V. Winfield, in the aggregate, owned approximately 85.9% of the voting stock of Santa Fe. All of the Company's directors serve as directors of InterGroup and all three of the Company's directors serve on the Board of Portsmouth.
As Chairman of the Securities Investment Committee, Mr. Winfield, directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Portsmouth and InterGroup and oversees the investment activity of those companies. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, Mr. Winfield, Portsmouth and InterGroup may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. The Company encourages such investments because it places personal resources of Mr. Winfield and the resources of Portsmouth and InterGroup, at risk in connection with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.
In December 1998, Board of Directors authorized the Company to obtain whole life insurance and split dollar insurance policies covering Mr. Winfield. During fiscal year 2017, the Company paid annual premium of $26,000 for the split dollar whole life insurance policy, owned by, and the beneficiary of which is, a trust for the benefit of Mr. Winfield's family. The Company has a secured right to receive, from any proceeds of the policy, reimbursement of all premiums paid prior to any payments to the beneficiary. During fiscal year 2017, Portsmouth paid annual premium of $17,000 for a split dollar policy also covering Mr. Winfield. The premiums associated with that spilt dollar policy are considered additional compensation to Mr. Winfield.
There are no other relationships or related transactions between the Company and any of its officers, directors, five-percent security holders or their families which require disclosure.

PROPOSAL NO. 2
RATIFICATION OF THE RETENTION OF  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of Moss Adams LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Although the action of shareholders in this matter is not required, the Audit Committee believes it is appropriate to seek shareholder ratification of this appointment. Ratification requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voted at the Annual Meeting.
We expect that a representative of Moss Adams LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders, and we will provide this representative with an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so.
THE FOLLOWING REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE SOLICITING MATERIAL OR TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE EXCHANGE ACT OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY DOCUMENT SO FILED.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee's responsibilities are described in a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee's primary duties and responsibilities are to: serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's financial reporting process and internal control system; appoint and approve the compensation of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; review and appraise the audit efforts of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; and provide an open avenue of communications among the independent registered public accounting firm, financial and senior management, and the Board of Directors. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company retained Hein & Associates LLP ("Hein") as its independent registered public accounting firm to provide audit and audit related services. Effective November 16, 2017, Hein combined with Moss Adams LLP ("Moss Adams"). As a result of this transaction, on November 16, 2017, Hein resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. Concurrent with such resignation, the Company's audit committee approved the engagement of Moss Adams as the new independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. All fees and expenses paid to Hein and Moss Adams were approved by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firms, and management represented to the Audit Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The discussions with Hein and Moss Adams also included the matters required by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114 (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU Section 380), as adopted by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") in Rule 3200T regarding "Communication with Audit Committees."
The Audit Committee has also received written disclosures and letters from Hein and Moss Adams, respectively, as required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, which was also discussed with Hein and Moss Adams, respectively.
Based on the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements, and the review and discussions with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE:  WILLIAM J. NANCE, CHAIRPERSON  JOHN C. LOVE
Audit Fees
On November 16, 2017, the Audit Committee appointed Moss Adams LLP ("Moss Adams") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Prior to the appointment of Moss Adams, Hein & Associates LLP ("Hein") served as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Burr Pilger Mayer, Inc. ("BPM") also provided services in connection with the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
The aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered by the Company's independent registered public accounting firms are set forth in the tables below. These fees were billed for audit of the Company's annual financial statements, review of financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-Q reports, and services provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings and engagements for those fiscal years.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies
The Audit Committee shall pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm, subject to any de minimis exceptions that may be set for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit. The Audit Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such subcommittee to grant pre-approvals shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services described herein were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to its pre-approval policies.
None of the hours expended on the independent registered public accounting firms' engagement to audit the Company's financial statements for the most recent fiscal year were attributed to work performed by persons other than the independent registered public accounting firm's full-time permanent employees.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE RETENTION OF MOSS ADAMS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.
