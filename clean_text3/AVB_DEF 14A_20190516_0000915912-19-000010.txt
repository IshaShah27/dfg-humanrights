The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on March 5, 2019, as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. Only holders of record of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), at that time will be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and at any postponements or adjournments thereof.
We request that you authorize a proxy to vote your shares, which is being solicited by the Board of Directors, by telephone or over the Internet by following the instructions on your proxy card. If you request printed copies of the proxy statement by mail, you may also authorize a proxy to vote your shares by completing and signing the enclosed proxy card and by mailing it promptly in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope.  Any proxy authorized by a holder of Common Stock may be revoked by delivering notice to the Company stating that the proxy is revoked using the same method as the original proxy authorization or by delivery of a properly authorized, later dated proxy. Holders of record of Common Stock who attend the Annual Meeting may vote in person, even if they have previously delivered a signed proxy or authorized a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, but the presence (without further action) of a stockholder at the Annual Meeting will not constitute revocation of a previously delivered proxy.

Q. Who may vote at the Annual Meeting? 
A. You may vote all the shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), that you owned at the close of business on March 5, 2019, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote on, these matters (the "Record Date"). On the Record Date, the Company had 138,686,823 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. You may cast one vote for each share of Common Stock held by you on all matters. 
Q. How do I obtain admission to the Annual Meeting? 
A. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to register in advance. All meeting attendees must present government‑issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, at the meeting. In addition, if you are authorized to represent a corporate or institutional stockholder, you must also present written evidence that you are the authorized representative of such stockholder. Please submit your request to register on or before Friday, May 10, 2019, by mailing a request to the Company's Corporate Secretary at 671 N.

Q. What constitutes a quorum at the Annual Meeting? 
A. The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of all of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and "broker non‑votes" will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. A "broker non‑vote" refers to a share represented at the meeting held by a broker, as to which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owner or person entitled to vote such shares and with respect to which, on one or more but not all matters, the broker does not have discretionary voting power to vote such share. 
[END TABLE]
Note that under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, if you hold shares through a bank, broker or other institution and you do not provide your voting instructions to them at least ten days before the Annual Meeting, that firm has the discretion to vote your shares on proposals that the NYSE has determined are routine, such as the ratification of the appointment of the independent public accounting firm. A bank, broker or institution that holds your shares cannot vote your shares on non‑routine matters, such as the election of directors, approval of compensation‑related matters, or a proposal submitted by a stockholder, without your voting instructions.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
A. At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to: (1) elect ten directors of the Company, (2) consider and vote upon ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for 2019, (3) consider and vote upon a resolution to approve, on a non‑binding, advisory basis, the Company's named executive officer compensation and (4) transact such other business as may be properly brought before the Annual Meeting, in each case as specified in the Notice of Annual meeting and more fully described in this Proxy Statement. 
Q. How do I vote? 
A. Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or indirectly as the beneficial owner of shares held for you by a broker or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), you may direct your vote without attending the Annual Meeting. You may vote by granting a proxy or, for shares you hold in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone or,  if you request printed copies of the proxy materials, by mail. Please refer to the summary instructions below and those included on your proxy card or, for shares you hold in street name, the voting instruction card provided by your broker or nominee.   
[END TABLE]
By Internet—If you have Internet access, you may authorize your proxy from any location in the world by following the "By Internet" instructions on the proxy card or, if applicable, the Internet voting instructions that may be described on the voting instruction card sent to you by your broker or nominee.
By Telephone—If you are calling from the United States or Canada, you may authorize your proxy by following the "By Telephone" instructions on the proxy card or, if applicable, the telephone voting instructions that may be described on the voting instruction card sent to you by your broker or nominee.
By Mail—If you request printed copies of the proxy materials, you may authorize your proxy by signing your proxy card and mailing it in the enclosed, postage‑prepaid and addressed envelope. For shares you hold in street name, you may sign the voting instruction card included by your broker or nominee and mail it in the envelope provided.
For shares held directly in your name, you may change your proxy instructions at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. You may do this by granting a new properly executed and later‑dated proxy using the same method you originally used to authorize your proxy, by filing a written revocation with the Secretary of the Company at the address of the Company set forth above, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting without further action will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked. You may change your proxy instructions for shares you beneficially own by submitting new voting instructions to your broker or nominee in the manner and within the time periods they prescribe. Table of Contents
If a properly signed proxy is submitted but not marked as to a particular item, the proxy will be voted (i) FOR the election of the nominees for director of the Company named in this Proxy Statement, (ii) FOR the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for 2019, and (iii) FOR the non‑binding, advisory resolution to approve the Company's named executive officer compensation. It is not anticipated that any matters other than those set forth in the Proxy Statement will be presented at the Annual Meeting. If other matters are presented, proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. What is householding? 
A. If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of Common Stock in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee may have sent you a notice that your household will receive only one annual report, notice of annual meeting and proxy statement. This procedure is known as "householding" and is intended to reduce the volume of duplicate information stockholders receive and also reduce our printing and postage costs. If you consented or were deemed to have consented to householding, your broker, bank or other nominee may send one copy of our annual report, notice of annual meeting and proxy statement to your address for all residents that own shares of Common Stock in street name. If you wish to revoke your consent to householding, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee. If you are receiving multiple copies of our annual report, notice of annual meeting and proxy statement, you may be able to request householding by contacting your broker, bank or other nominee.

II. PROPOSALS 
[END TABLE]
Proposal 1: Election of Directors
The Board of Directors currently consists of eleven members. As previously announced, Peter S. Rummell is retiring from the Board of Directors immediately following the Annual Meeting and is not standing for reelection.  The Board of Directors has nominated for election all other current directors. Accordingly, ten nominees will stand for election at the Annual Meeting and if elected will serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualify. The following individuals have been nominated by the Board of Directors to serve as directors: Glyn F. Aeppel, Terry S. Brown, Alan B. Buckelew, Ronald L. Havner, Jr., Stephen P. Hills, Richard J. Lieb, Timothy J. Naughton, H. Jay Sarles, Susan Swanezy and W. Edward Walter (each, a "Nominee" and, collectively, the "Nominees"). The Board of Directors anticipates that each of the Nominees, if elected, will serve as a director. However, if any person nominated by the Board of Directors is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve, the proxies will be voted for the election of such other person as the Board of Directors may recommend. You may not vote for more than ten directors at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Required Vote and Recommendation 
[END TABLE]
Only holders of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote on this proposal. Proxies will be voted for all of the Nominees unless contrary instructions are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. Under the Company's Bylaws, a majority of the total votes cast as to each Nominee is required to elect such Nominee. Under Maryland law, abstentions and broker non‑votes are not treated as votes cast. Accordingly, an abstention or broker non‑vote will have no effect on the result of the vote.
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR all of   the Nominees. 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
Information Regarding Nominees
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board are focused on ensuring that the composition of the Board continues to provide the diversity of experience, functional skill set, expertise, and thought necessary to appropriately address the needs of the Company and its stockholders.  
Board Tenure and Gender Diversity for 2019 Nominees
The Company's Board of Directors has included in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines term expectations that reflect the Company's view of the importance of board succession planning and refreshment.
In general, the Company expects that a non-employee director will not be re-nominated after the completion of 12 full years of service or within the several years that follow.
The section below, in addition to providing full biographies of each Nominee, summarizes key qualifications, skills and experiences of the Nominee that the Board considers important in its evaluation and decision to nominate or re-nominate that individual to the Board.  Exclusion of a factor for a Nominee does not necessarily mean the Nominee does not possess that attribute. It means only that when the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considered the skills and experiences of that Nominee in the overall context of the members of the Board of Directors, that attribute is not considered a key factor in the determination to nominate or re-nominate that individual.  The full Nominee biographies describe each director's qualifications and relevant experience in more detail.  The age of each Nominee shown below is as of the date of this Proxy Statement.

Proposal 2: Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors
The Board recommends that the stockholders ratify the Audit Committee's selection of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as the independent auditors of the Company for fiscal year 2019. Ernst & Young was also the Company's principal independent auditors for fiscal year 2018. If the selection of Ernst & Young is not ratified, the Audit Committee anticipates that it will nevertheless engage Ernst & Young as auditors for fiscal year 2019 but will consider whether it should select a different auditor for fiscal year 2020. If the selection of Ernst & Young is ratified by the stockholders, the Audit Committee may nevertheless determine, based on changes in fees, personnel or for other reasons, to engage a firm other than Ernst & Young for the 2019 audit.
Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to respond to appropriate questions.

Proposal 3: Non‑Binding, Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 24 of this proxy statement describes the Company's executive officer compensation program and decisions made by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors with respect to the 2018 compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other officers named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 48 (the "Named Executive Officers"). As noted in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Company's goals for its executive compensation program are (i) to attract, motivate and retain experienced and effective executives, (ii) to direct the performance of those executives with clearly defined goals and measures of achievement and (iii) to align the interests of management with the interests of our stockholders.
At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders voted on a proposal regarding the frequency of holding a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (a "Say-on-Pay Vote"), among other matters. A majority of the votes cast on the frequency proposal were cast in favor of holding a Say-on-Pay Vote every year, which was consistent with the recommendation of our Board of Directors. Our Board currently intends for the Company to hold a Say-on-Pay Vote every year at least until the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is the next required advisory vote on the frequency of holding a Say-on-Pay Vote.
While the vote on the following resolution is advisory in nature and therefore will not bind us to take any particular action, our Board of Directors will carefully consider the stockholder vote resulting from the proposal in making future decisions regarding our compensation program. The Board of Directors is asking stockholders to cast a non‑binding, advisory vote on the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and any related material disclosed in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED, on a non‑binding, advisory basis, by the stockholders of the Company."
[BEGIN TABLE]
Required Vote and Recommendation 
[END TABLE]
Only holders of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote on this proposal. Proxies will be voted for adoption of the resolution approving the compensation disclosed unless contrary instructions are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. A majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual 
Meeting is required to provide non‑binding, advisory approval of the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers. Under Maryland law, abstentions and broker non‑votes are not treated as votes cast. Accordingly, an abstention or broker non‑vote will have no effect on the result of the vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the resolution to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers. 
[END TABLE]
Other Matters
The Board of Directors does not know of any matters other than those described in this Proxy Statement that will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. If other matters are presented, proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Regardless of the number of shares you own, your vote is very important to the Company. Please authorize a proxy by telephone or over the Internet to vote your shares by following the instructions on your proxy card or complete, sign, date and promptly return the enclosed proxy card.

III. Corporate Governance And Related Matters 
[END TABLE]
Code of Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code"). The Code constitutes a "code of ethics," as defined by the SEC, that applies to the Company's Board of Directors as well as its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, principal accounting officer, controller, and other employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines. Copies of the Code and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate 
Governance Documents." To the extent required by the rules of the SEC and the NYSE, we will disclose amendments and waivers relating to these documents in the same place on our website. Additional information on corporate governance policies is included in "Compensation Policies" on pages 44-45, including information on the following Company policies: Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines; Prohibition Against Hedging, Pledging or Borrowing against Company Stock; Severance Policy; and Policy on Recoupment of Incentive Compensation (Clawback Policy).
Board of Directors and its Committees
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board of Directors 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors currently consists of eleven directors.  As previously announced, Peter S. Rummell, a current director, is retiring from the Board of Directors when his current term expires immediately following the Annual Meeting and is not standing for reelection.  Each of the other current directors is a candidate for election. The Board of Directors met six times during 2018. The Board of Directors generally schedules regular executive sessions at each of its meetings during which the Company's independent directors meet without management participation. During 2018, each of the directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and meetings of the committees of the Board of Directors of which he or she was a member. The Board's policy is that each director attend the Company's annual meetings of stockholders at which he or she is a nominee, and all directors who were nominees were in attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
As discussed below under Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board considers a variety of factors when choosing candidates for Board appointment or nomination. While the Board values long‑tenured directors who know the Company and management well, the 
Board also believes that it is important to assure that from time to time vacancies occur on the Board that create opportunities for new directors who may bring different or more recent experiences or expertise to the Board. Consistent with this philosophy, five new directors have joined the AvalonBay Board at or subsequent to the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: Ron Havner (2014), Terry Brown (2015), Richard Lieb (2016), Susan Swanezy (2016), and Stephen Hills (2017). 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines incorporate term expectations that reflect the Board's view of the importance of board succession planning. Specifically, the Corporate Governance Guidelines (i) express an expectation that an independent director will not be re‑nominated after the completion of 12 full years of service or within the several years that follow; (ii) express an expectation that the Lead Independent Director will serve in that role for approximately three to five years; and (iii) express an expectation that Committee chairs will serve for three to five years. In each case, the guideline is flexible and the exact timing for any transition will depend on the needs of the Board at the time and the timing of identification and nomination of a successor. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit Committee 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee. The current members of this committee are Messrs. Buckelew (Current Chair), Havner, Hills  and Lieb, and Ms. Swanezy.  Following the Annual Meeting, the Board expects that Mr. Havner will be appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Buckelew and Havner are each an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. In the case of Mr. Buckelew this determination was  Table of Contents based on his MBA, experience as Chief Financial Officer at Princess Cruises, and the fact that the Internal Audit Function of Carnival Cruises has reported to him, and in the case of Mr. Havner it was based on his past experience as a Certified Public Accountant and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer of a public company. The designation of Messrs. Buckelew and Havner by the Board as "audit committee financial experts" is not intended to be a representation that they are experts for any purpose as a result of this designation, nor is it intended to impose on them any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations or liabilities imposed on them as  members of the Audit Committee and the Board in the absence of this designation. The Board of Directors has determined that the current and prospective members of the Audit Committee, including the audit committee financial experts, are "independent" under the rules of the NYSE and financially literate. The Audit Committee, among other functions, has the sole authority to appoint and replace the independent auditors, is responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditors, reviews the results of the audit engagement with the independent auditors, and reviews and discusses with management and the independent auditors the Company's quarterly and annual financial statements and major changes in accounting and auditing principles. The Audit Committee met eight times during 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee. A copy of the Audit Committee charter is available on the "Investor relations" section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate Governance Documents."
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Committee 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has established a Compensation Committee. The current members of this committee are Messrs. Walter (Chair), Buckelew, Lieb and Sarles.  The Board of Directors has determined that the members of the Compensation Committee are "independent" under the rules of the NYSE. The Compensation Committee, among other functions, reviews, designs and determines management compensation structures, programs and amounts, establishes corporate and management performance goals and objectives, and reviews and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the Company's incentive compensation plans, including the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Equity Incentive Plan"). The Compensation Committee also reviews employment agreements and arrangements with senior officers (there are no employment agreements with executives at present). In addition, our Equity Incentive Plan provides that the Committee, in its discretion, may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company all or part of the Committee's authority and duties under the Equity Incentive Plan with respect to awards, including the granting of awards to individuals who are not subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Compensation Committee has engaged Steven Hall & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm, to provide it with independent advice and counsel on executive compensation, as well as competitive pay practices. Steven Hall & Partners does not provide any services directly to the Company or its management. The Compensation Committee met four times during 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee. A copy of the Compensation Committee charter is available on the "Investor relations" section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate Governance Documents."

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
[END TABLE]
Composition, Independence and Function: The Board of Directors has established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The current members of this committee are Mr. Sarles (Chair), Ms. Aeppel, and Messrs. Brown, Rummell, and Walter. As noted above, Mr. Rummell will retire following the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors has determined that the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are "independent" under the rules of the NYSE. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's functions include: identifying individuals qualified to become Board members; recommending to the full Board each year a slate for nomination for election to the Board; considering policies relating to Board and committee meetings; reviewing and recommending changes to director compensation; recommending the establishment or dissolution of Board committees; reviewing and considering succession plans with respect to the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (including through periodic evaluation and  Table of Contents discussion with the Board of internal candidates for such succession); reviewing policies and activities in the areas of political contributions, charitable giving and corporate responsibility; and addressing other issues regarding corporate governance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met four times during 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. A copy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter is available on the "Investor relations" section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate Governance Documents."
Evaluation and Nomination of Director Candidates: One of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's key functions is identifying and nominating candidates for service on the Board. In this regard, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the qualifications set forth in the Company's corporate governance guidelines, which include the nominee's business and professional background; history of leadership or contributions to other organizations; functional skill set and expertise; general understanding of marketing, finance, accounting and other elements relevant to the success of a publicly‑traded company in today's business environment; and service on other boards of directors. 
Given the current business, opportunities and challenges of the Company, among the key attributes the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee looks for in director candidates are the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accounting/Financial Literacy 
• Public Company CEO Experience 
• C-Level Management Experience 
• Other Public Board Experience 
• Financial/Capital Markets Experience 
• Marketing/Brand Management/Consumer Focus 
• Real Estate Industry Experience 
• REIT Structure Experience 
• Real Estate Development Experience 
• Technology and Innovation Experience 
[END TABLE]
In recommending a slate of nominees for director and in identifying new candidates for service, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers whether there is and will be an adequate distribution and representation of relevant skills and experiences across the Board as a whole. In addition, the Board may consider diversity of background, experience and thought in evaluating and recommending candidates for election. The Board believes that diversity is important because a variety of points of view can contribute to a more effective decision‑making process. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may employ a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. 
In considering whether to recommend re-nomination of a current director for another term, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers whether the skills, commitment and performance as a director of such individual are such that the individual's continued service on the Board is desirable. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also assess the size of the Board, the need for particular expertise on the Board, the upcoming election cycle of the Board and whether any vacancies are expected, due to retirement or otherwise. 
In the event that vacancies are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider various potential candidates for director who may come to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's attention through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. These candidates are evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and they may be considered at any time during the year.
Nominees Recommended by Stockholders: In exercising its function of recommending individuals for nomination by the Board for election as directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders. The procedure by which stockholders may submit such recommendations is set forth in the Company's Bylaws. See "Other Matters – Stockholder Nominations for Directors and Proposals for Annual Meetings" for a summary of these requirements. When nominations are properly submitted, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders under the criteria summarized above. Following verification of the stockholder status of persons proposing candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes an initial analysis of the qualifications of any candidate recommended by stockholders or others pursuant to the criteria summarized above to determine whether the candidate is qualified for service on the Board of Directors before deciding to undertake a complete evaluation of the candidate. If any materials are provided by a stockholder or professional search firm in connection with the nomination of a director candidate, such materials are forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as part of its review. The same identifying and evaluating procedures apply to all candidates for director nomination, including candidates submitted by stockholders. In the case of stockholder nominations, the Board may also consider the specific information required to be provided by the  Table of Contents nominating stockholder pursuant to the requirements of the Company's Bylaws.  Stockholders may also nominate directors in accordance with the proxy access provisions of the Company's Bylaws, as described in "Other Matters - Stockholder Nominations for Directors and Proposals for the Annual Meeting".
If you would like the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider a prospective candidate, please submit the candidate's name and qualifications and other information in accordance with the requirements for director nominations by stockholders in the Company's Bylaws to: AvalonBay Communities, Inc., Ballston Tower, 671 N. Glebe Road, Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22203, Attention: Corporate Secretary. See also the discussion of Stockholder Engagement and Responsiveness included in this Proxy Statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Investment and Finance Committee 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has established an Investment and Finance Committee. The current members of this committee are Ms. Aeppel (Chair), and Messrs. Brown, Havner, Hills, Naughton, and Rummell and Ms. Swanezy. Following the Annual Meeting, Mr. Rummell will retire from the Board and the Board expects that Mr. Brown will be appointed Chair of the Investment and Finance Committee.  The Investment and Finance Committee was formed, among other reasons, to review and monitor the acquisition, disposition, development and redevelopment of the Company's communities, and to review and monitor the financial structure, capital sourcing strategy and financial plans and projections of the Company. The Investment and Finance Committee has authority, subject to certain limits and guidelines set by the Board of Directors and Maryland law, to approve investment and financing activity. The Investment and Finance Committee met twice during 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Leadership Structure and Lead Independent Director 
[END TABLE]
Timothy J. Naughton, our Chief Executive Officer and President, also serves as the Company's Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that the Company is best served by having Mr. Naughton serve as Chairman of the Board in addition to Chief Executive Officer and President, as opposed to appointing one of the other current directors or a future director to serve as Chairman of the Board. Among other benefits, Mr. Naughton's role as Chief Executive Officer and President enables him, working with the Lead Independent Director, to act as a bridge between management and the Board, helping management and the Board to act with a common purpose. Mr. Naughton's combined roles as Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board promote unified leadership and direction for the Company. To help assure sound corporate governance practices, the Board of Directors established the position of Lead Independent Director in 2003.  Mr. Sarles has served as the Lead Independent Director since May 2015 and the Board expects that Mr. Walter will be appointed to that position immediately following the Annual Meeting. The  role of Lead Independent Director includes presiding at all meetings of the Board of Directors at which the Chairman of the Board is not present, serving as a liaison between the Chairman of the Board and the independent directors, establishing and approving meeting agendas for the Board, having the authority to call meetings of the independent directors, conferring with the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly, and acting as a contact person for stockholders and others who wish to communicate with the independent directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board of Directors Risk Oversight 
[END TABLE]
The Company and the Board have a number of practices with regard to Board oversight of risk management matters. The charter of each of the Company's Board committees provides that each committee shall, from time to time to the extent that committee deems appropriate, review risk and compliance matters relevant to that committee and report the results of such review to the full Board. As required by NYSE rules, the charter of the Audit Committee states that the Audit Committee will assist with Board oversight of risk and compliance matters, and in any event will review the perceived major financial risk exposures of the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. At most regularly scheduled Board meetings, the Board reviews key matters relating to the Company's finances, liquidity, operations and investment activity. On an annual basis, the Board engages in a broader discussion about company‑wide risk management.
Although it is not the primary reason for the selection of the current leadership structure by the Board, the  Table of Contents
Company and the Board believe that the current leadership structure of the Board, including both a Chairman of the Board and a separate Lead Independent Director, helps facilitate these risk oversight functions by providing multiple channels for risk-related concerns and comments. The Company's operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences, including those described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10‑K and other filings with the SEC. The Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Despite the risk oversight activities described above, there can be no assurance that the Company's current practices have identified every potential material risk, are sufficient to address these risks, or that any risks will not result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business or operations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Independence of the Board 
[END TABLE]
The NYSE has adopted independence standards for companies listed on the NYSE, which apply to the Company. These standards require a majority of the Board of Directors to be independent and every member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to be independent. NYSE standards provide that a director is considered independent only if the Board of Directors "affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company)." In addition, NYSE rules and related NYSE commentary generally provide that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is an employee, or whose immediate family member is an executive officer, of the Company is not independent until three years after the end of such employment relationship; 
• A director who receives, or whose immediate family member receives, more than $120,000 per year in direct compensation from the Company, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), is not independent until three years after he or she ceases to receive more than $120,000 per year in such compensation; compensation received by an immediate family member for service as an employee of the Company (other than an executive officer) need not be considered in determining independence under this test; 
• A director is not independent if (A) the director is a current partner or employee of a firm that is the Company's internal or external auditor; (B) the director has an immediate family member who is a current partner of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on the Company's audit; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years (but is no longer) a partner or employee of such a firm  
[END TABLE]
and personally worked on the Company's audit within that time;
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is employed, or whose immediate family member is employed, as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's present executives serve on that company's compensation committee is not independent until three years after the end of such service or the employment relationship; and 
• A director who is an executive officer or an employee, or whose immediate family member is an executive officer, of a company that makes payments to, or receives payments from, the Company for property or services in an amount which, in a single fiscal year, exceeds the greater of $1 million or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues, is not independent until three years after falling below such threshold. 
[END TABLE]
To determine which of its members is independent, the Board of Directors used the above standards and also considered whether a director had any other past or present relationships with the Company which created conflicts or the appearance of conflicts.
Based on consideration of the foregoing and the absence of any other such transactions, relationships or arrangements found as a result of this review, the Board determined that all nominees for directors are independent, except for Mr. Naughton, who currently serves as the Chairman of the Board and the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President.
NYSE rules provide for additional independence standards that apply to members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. The Board has determined that each current and proposed member of these committees satisfies these additional standards.  Table of Contents
Stockholder Engagement and Responsiveness
We consider our relationship with our stockholders to be an important part of the Company's success and we value the outlook and opinions of our investors. During 2018 and early 2019 our management reached out to stockholders who collectively held a majority of the Company's outstanding stock to discuss the Company's practices and policies with respect to environmental, social and governance matters ("ESG"), and other matters. Management spoke with stockholders who responded to that outreach regarding such issues, in addition to speaking with the stockholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis.  These discussions addressed governance matters including board composition and refreshment, stockholder rights, executive compensation and sustainability efforts. The feedback from stockholders was conveyed to and discussed with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board.
The goal of these conversations was to ensure that management and the Board understood and considered the ESG issues that are most important to our stockholders and to enable the Company to address them effectively.
In addition to conversations with our stockholders, the Company from time to time receives correspondence from stockholders and stockholder advocacy groups and responds and/or shares this correspondence with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board where requested or otherwise appropriate.
The Board of Directors also considers the votes of stockholders at the Company's Annual Meeting and discusses potential issues raised through that forum. 
At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received the affirmative vote of less than 75% of votes cast while other directors received the affirmative vote of more than 90% of votes cast.  Based on discussions with stockholders and ISS, the Board believes that this vote reflected a desire on the part of some stockholders that the Company revise its Bylaw provision relating to rights of stockholders to amend the Bylaws. The Company's Bylaws permit the stockholders of the Company to amend the Company's Bylaws by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock pursuant to a binding proposal submitted by a stockholder or group of up to five stockholders holding at least 1% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock for at least one year (except that stockholders may not amend or repeal (i) the bylaw that provides for indemnification of officers and directors without the consent of any indemnified person adversely affected by such amendment or (ii) the bylaw which addresses procedures for amendment of the Bylaws without the approval of the Board). The Board believes that this bylaw amendment enables stockholders who hold a meaningful stake in the Company for more than a brief period to propose binding amendments to the Company's Bylaws.  While the Board believes that this is an appropriate Bylaw provision and is in the Company's and stockholders' best interests, the Board continues to review and monitor this matter. Table of Contents

Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), reviews the financial reporting process of the Company on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has primary responsibility for this process, including the Company's system of internal controls, and for the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and for the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's independent auditors, and not the Audit Committee, are responsible for auditing and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles. In this context, during 2018 and 2019, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements and Ernst & Young's evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting with management and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the Auditing Standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee received from the independent auditors the written disclosures required by the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee regarding independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors their independence from the Company and its management. Relying on the reviews, disclosures and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC, and the Board of Directors has approved this recommendation. The Audit Committee and the Board have also recommended, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of Ernst &Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons
The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, adopted by the Company's Board of Directors and evidenced in writing, provides that no employee of the Company, including an executive officer or director, may engage in activities that create a conflict of interest with the Company unless all relevant details have been disclosed and an appropriate waiver permitting the conduct has been received. An activity constitutes a conflict of interest under the Code if (i) the activity could adversely affect or compete with the Company, (ii) any interest, connection or benefit to the employee or director from the activity could reasonably be expected to cause such employee or director to consider anything other than the best interest of the Company when deliberating and voting on Company matters or (iii) any interest, connection or benefit to the employee or director from the activity could give such employee or director or a member of his or her family an improper benefit that he or she obtains on account of his or her position within the Company. An executive officer or member of the Board of Directors may only receive a waiver from the Board or any designated committee of the Board, and any waiver granted to an executive officer or director will be disclosed to the Company's stockholders to the extent required by law or NYSE rules.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Summary of 2018 Achievements 
[END TABLE]
Summary:  Apartment market fundamentals accelerated more quickly than expected in 2018. 2018 earnings per share-diluted was $7.05.  2018 Core Funds from Operations (known as "Core FFO") of $9.00 per share was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our initial outlook provided in January 2018 and 4.4% over 2017 Core FFO per share. This outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected results in our Established Communities portfolio.
Over the course of 2018, we (i) completed $742 million of new development, (ii) raised approximately $1.7 billion of new capital, including through the contribution of assets in New York City valued at $760 million to a new joint venture ("NYC JV") in which we retained a 20% interest, (iii) de-levered the balance sheet, and (iv) made important strides within the area of corporate responsibility.
Operating Activity:  Rental revenue for Established Communities increased 2.5% in 2018, which was approximately 40 basis points above our initial outlook. Net Operating Income (known as "NOI") for Established Communities increased 2.3% in 2018, which was 30 basis points above our initial outlook. Table of Contents
Development Activity:  We completed seven new development communities containing an aggregate of 1,915 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of retail space for an aggregate total capital cost of $742 million in 2018. During the year, we also started construction of eight new apartment communities that are expected to contain 2,154 apartment homes and 57,000 square feet of retail space for an aggregate projected total capital cost of $718 million.
At year‑end 2018, we had 21 communities under construction that are expected to contain 6,609 apartment homes and 87,000 square feet of retail space. These communities are projected to be completed for an aggregate total capital cost of approximately $2.4 billion.  In addition, we are pursuing a potential for-sale strategy of individual condominium units for the residential portion of 15 West 61st Street, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 172 residential units and 67,000 square feet of retail space when completed and is expected to be developed for an estimated total capital cost of $620 million.
Dividend Growth:  In January 2019, we announced a dividend increase of 3.4%, to a quarterly rate of $1.52 per share. Since the first quarter of 2011, we have increased the quarterly dividend by 70%.
Balance Sheet Management:  During 2018, we raised approximately $1.7 billion of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes, sale of common shares, the sale of consolidated operating communities, and the contribution of consolidated assets to the NYC JV. As of year-end 2018, net debt-to-Core EBITDAre declined to 4.6 times, a low for the cycle, from 4.9 times as of year-end 2017. Core EBITDAre is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property, adjusted to reflect our share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated entities and the impact of non-core items. In addition, our percentage of unencumbered NOI increased to 91% in 2018, from 89% in 2017.
Portfolio Management:  During 2018, we acquired four communities, containing 1,096 apartment homes, for an aggregate purchase price of $334 million; three of these communities are located in our expansion markets of Southeast Florida and Denver. We sold eight wholly-owned communities in 2018, containing 1,798 apartment homes and 17,000 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate sales price of $619 million.
As noted above, we also contributed five wholly-owned communities to the NYC JV. The Company retained a 20% ownership interest in the NYC JV and is acting as the managing member of the venture as well as the property manager for the communities.
Earnings and Core FFO Growth:  2018 earnings per share-diluted was $7.05. Core FFO per share increased by 4.4% over the prior year to $9.00. For the three year period ended December 31, 2018 (the period measured for this metric in our maturing performance awards), our Core FFO grew at an annualized rate of 6.0%.
Other Achievements:  We continued our ESG leadership in the multifamily sector in 2018. The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) awarded us 4 out of 5 "Green Stars" for leadership in environmental sustainability. In addition, a number of firms who evaluate ESG performance for investors continue to rank us as one of the most advanced U.S. companies on a variety of ESG metrics. We were included in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list and, in January 2019, the Company became a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index Series.
We remain in the 90th percentile in associate engagement, as measured by a third-party service provider who surveys leading companies on workforce engagement. In 2018, we were recognized by Glassdoor employee choice ratings as one of the Top 100 companies to work for in the U.S for the second consecutive year and Indeed, another online recruiting website, named the Company as a Top Five Place to Work in the DC Metro Area.
Our residents value our efforts, too, and we ranked first among publicly traded multifamily REITs for online reputation according to J. Turner Research's Online Reputation Assessment Power Rankings for a third consecutive year.
Definitions and Reconciliations:  For definitions and reconciliations of FFO, Core FFO, Established Communities, and NOI, see pages 33-35, 18, and 39-40, respectively, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Form 10-K"), as filed with the SEC.

Our Executive Compensation Philosophy
AvalonBay's Total Compensation Program is designed to:

• Align the interests of management with the interests of stockholders, 
• Direct performance with clearly defined goals and measures of achievement, and 
• Assure that compensation is aligned with performance

Sean Breslin Chief Operating Officer 
Matthew Birenbaum Chief Investment Officer 
Stephen Wilson Executive Vice President, Development 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Overview
Consistent with our total compensation philosophy, a substantial majority of the target pay of our Named Executive Officers is variable and contingent on performance.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2018 Compensation At‑A‑Glance
Base Salary.  Mr. Naughton's base salary was increased in 2017 from $950,000 to $1,000,000 and remained the same for 2018. Mr. Naughton previously maintained a base salary of $950,000 from 2013 until 2017. 
Cash Bonus.  Mr. Naughton's target cash bonus increased from 175% to 200% of base salary in 2018. 75% of the target cash bonus is based on corporate performance factors and 25% is based on individual performance. The achievement levels for the corporate performance and individual factors for 2018 were determined to be 117.9% and 120%, respectively, resulting in a final cash bonus for 2018 of $2,368,500.
Stock Bonus.  Mr. Naughton's target stock bonus for 2018 was $1,750,000. The performance measures used in calculating the stock bonus reflect different elements of the Company's performance and are not duplicative of the performance measures used to evaluate corporate performance under the annual cash bonus program. The achievement level for these stock bonus performance measures for 2018 was 121.6%, which resulted in a payout of $2,128,000.  The payout is delivered in the form of restricted stock that vests ratably over three years from the date of grant. Please note that under applicable SEC rules this award will be disclosed in the 2020 proxy statement Summary Compensation Table as the actual grant of stock based on 2018 achievement occurred in 2019. Table of Contents
Performance Awards.  Mr. Naughton's target performance award for the 2018 - 2020 performance period was $5,250,000. Sixty percent of the target award was tied to three-year total shareholder return ("TSR") metrics, including absolute and relative comparisons, and 40% of the target award was tied to three-year relative financial operating metrics as described in more detail below.
With respect to the three-year performance cycle concluding in 2018, Mr. Naughton's award was settled in 24,205 shares of restricted stock valued at $4,737,403, based on the closing stock price of the Company's Common Stock on the NYSE on February 14, 2019 of $195.72. The 2016 - 2018 performance award was awarded in February 2016 and the performance cycle ended in December 2018, with the Board of Directors certifying the actual achievement in February 2019. Consistent with the other performance awards granted by the Company, 60% of the target award was tied to three-year TSR metrics, including absolute and relative comparisons, and 40% of the target award was tied to three-year relative financial operating metrics. The Company achieved 81.3% of target payout for the 2016 - 2018 performance awards.

Impact of Company's Performance on Named Executive Officer Compensation
A substantial portion of our Named Executive Officers' compensation is linked to performance, both short‑term and long‑term.
Annual Cash Bonus:
Core FFO per Share: The Board believes that Core FFO per share is a key measure of the Company's performance and accordingly it was given a 50% weighting in determining achievement of the corporate component of the 2018 Annual Bonus goals. The following table shows that the Company increased its target goal for Core FFO per share in each of the past four years, from $7.35 per share in 2015 to $8.93 in 2018. The target goal represents a compounded annual growth rate of 6.71% for the past three years.  For 2018, actual Core FFO per share was $9.00, which was higher than the target goal of $8.93, resulting in 123.3% of target performance. Table of Contents
Development and Redevelopment NOI: At the beginning of the year, budgeted NOI is established for each development and redevelopment community based on construction progress and expected deliveries and occupancies.  At year end, actual NOI for each community is compared to budgeted NOI.   Variances to budgeted NOI may be attributed to schedule accelerations or delays, faster or slower absorption of delivered units, or expense savings or overruns, among other factors.  The target goal is to achieve budgeted NOI.  Significant variances from budget, both positive and negative, are capped at threshold and maximum levels.  For 2018, the actual variance for Development NOI approximated budget, resulting in near target performance.  The actual variance for Redevelopment NOI was favorable to budget, resulting in above target performance.
[BEGIN TABLE]

2018 Development Lease-Up NOI of $52.4M vs. Budget of $52.9M 10% -10.0% 0.0% 10.0% -1.0% 95.1% 
2018 Redevelopment NOI of $143.5M vs. Budget of $142.7M 5% -3.0% 0.0% 3.0% 0.5% 118.0% 
[END TABLE]
Development Yield: The development yield (i.e., projected NOI/total capital cost) performance for communities that achieve stabilized occupancy during the year is compared to our target yield for such developments. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.  The target goal is to meet our pre-established target yield for each development community.  Performance is determined based on the weighted average of the stabilized Development yields compared to the weighted average of the target yields for the basket of annual completions.  The yields are weighted based on total capital cost.  The target development yield is established at construction start for each property based on our cost of capital and deal specific attributes.  In this case, the actual variance in stabilized yield compared to target yield for the 2018 development communities, approximates zero, resulting in near target performance.

[END TABLE]
Our 2018 strategic initiatives included projects related to market expansion with a focus on Denver and Southeast Florida, further standardizing design and product protocols, increasing our focus on talent management, and  Table of Contents reimagining our operating model for increased efficiency and revenue growth. Our 2018 corporate initiatives continued to focus on enhancing our technology platform, expanding internal capabilities to provide new business insights and competitive advantages, and continuing the focus on strengthening our core operations.  Substantial Progress on Strategic and Corporate Initiatives was made in 2018, and the Compensation Committee determined that the achievement on this category was 125% of target, based on significant progress on each of the initiatives during the year.
Effectiveness of Management is defined as capital allocation on development opportunities, portfolio management, balance sheet and liquidity management, talent management and leadership development, high levels of associate engagement, and managing overhead expenses.  For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that achievement on this category was 125% of target.

[END TABLE]
The above performance measures represent different aspects of the Company's business and are not duplicative of the measures under the corporate annual cash bonus program. Same Store Controllable NOI measures our stabilized community performance. Net Promoter Score is a measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction, which allows the Company to assess the value of our services to our customers and potential customers. Construction and Development metrics reflect key financial business drivers of the Company's success and the CEO's commitment to safety.  Talent Development and Succession Planning ensures that future leaders of the Company are thoroughly trained and developed.
The Annual Stock Bonus for the Named Executive Officers other than the CEO was based on their respective business unit performance.
Once the final achievement for the annual stock bonus is determined, the number of shares of restricted stock is calculated and awarded to each Named Executive Officer.  The restricted stock will vest ratably over three years after the date of grant, subject to the Named Executive Officer's continued employment through each such vesting date, but subject to earlier acceleration of vesting in the event of a termination due to death, disability, retirement, or termination by the Company without cause.  The annual stock bonus performance period was calendar year 2018, with performance determined upon the completion of the 2018 year. The actual issuance of the time-based restricted stock occurred in February 2019.
Performance Awards:  Our performance awards with performance periods ending in 2018 consisted of the following measures: Table of Contents

[END TABLE]
Sixty percent of each officer's total performance award target value was tied to the TSR metrics identified above and 40% of the total performance award target value was tied to the operating metrics identified above.  Because the Monte Carlo value of a unit was used to calculate the number of target performance units tied to TSR metrics and the actual stock price was used to calculate the number of target performance units tied to operating metrics, the actual total number of units awarded reflected 64.8% based on the TSR metrics and 35.2% based on the operating metrics.
Realized Pay for 2018 Performance
The following table shows one way in which our Compensation Committee looked at the compensation paid and awarded to each of the Named Executive Officers for service and performance with respect to 2018. This table differs from the Summary Compensation Table provided on page 48, which includes several items that are driven by accounting and reporting requirements that are not necessarily reflective of the compensation actually realized by the executive with respect to a particular year. The primary difference between this supplemental table and the Summary Compensation Table is the timing and method used to value multi‑year performance award units and stock awards.
SEC rules require that the grant date fair value of all performance award units and stock awards be reported in the Summary Compensation Table in the row for the year in which they were granted, regardless of which year the awards were made with respect to or (in the case of performance awards) which year the awards pay out in the form of restricted shares. As a result, a significant portion of the total compensation for 2018 reported in the Summary Compensation Table relates to restricted stock awards granted in early 2018 for performance in 2017 or, in the case of performance awards, awards for the 2018 - 2020 performance cycle for which performance has not yet been determined and for which the value is uncertain (and which may end up having no realized value at all).
In contrast, the table immediately below is provided to illustrate the actual cash and restricted shares received by each Named Executive Officer for service and performance in 2018 and the restricted shares realized for performance awards maturing on December 31, 2018. Note that the amounts reported below differ substantially from the amounts determined under SEC rules and reported in the Summary Compensation Table. This table is not a substitute for the Summary Compensation Table.  Table of Contents

How We Review Market Compensation 
[END TABLE]
In determining the total compensation for each Named Executive Officer, which is the sum of base salary, bonus and long‑term incentives, the Compensation Committee generally considers a number of factors on a subjective basis, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i) the scope of the officer's responsibilities within the Company and in relation to comparable officers at various companies within the peer group described below; 
(ii) the experience of the officer within our industry and at the Company; 
(iii) performance of the officer and his or her contribution to the Company; 
(iv) the Company's financial budget and general level of wage increases throughout the Company for the coming year; 
(v) a review of historical compensation information for the individual officer; 
(vi) the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer (other than with regard to his own compensation); and  
(vii) data regarding compensation paid to officers with comparable titles, positions or responsibilities at REITs that are considered by the Compensation Committee to be comparable for these purposes. 
[END TABLE]
An officer's target compensation is not mechanically set to be a particular percentage of the peer group average, although, as noted, the Compensation Committee does review the officer's compensation relative to the peer group to help the Compensation Committee perform the subjective analysis described above.
An officer's target compensation may vary from the peer group data for the following reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) the officer's role and experience within the Company may be different from the role and experience of comparable officers at the peer companies; 
(b) the actual compensation for comparable officers at the peer companies may be the result of a year of over-performance or under-performance by the peer group; 
(c) the target compensation and performance goals for comparable officers at peer companies may not have the same rigor as at the Company; and 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d) the Compensation Committee believes that ultimately the decision as to appropriate target compensation for a particular officer should be made based on the full review described above. 
[END TABLE]
Our incentive programs are designed so that actual performance in excess of the performance targets results in payouts above target (with caps on above target payouts) and actual performance below the performance targets results in payouts below target or no payout.
[BEGIN TABLE]
How We Select and Use Peer Groups 
[END TABLE]
Companies for Market Compensation Purposes:
The Company regularly reviews the reference peer group described below, which it uses when evaluating the appropriate levels of executive compensation, in order to maintain consistency and relevancy. In determining the peer group composition, the following elements are considered.
The final peers selected have one or more of the following characteristics:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Asset Focus (multi‑family/complexity of operations): a meaningful portfolio of multifamily properties and/or intense property management operations 
• Size: defined as total capitalization (equity plus debt) within 0.5x to 2.0x of AvalonBay 
• Talent: companies with whom we could compete for talent 
[END TABLE]
The Company now uses the following 15 companies in its peer group for comparison of total compensation. GGP was acquired by Brookfield Property Partners in August 2018.
Source: S&P Global  Table of Contents
Companies for Performance Award Measurement Purposes
The Company uses a different peer group for determining performance under its performance awards. The peer group for determining the level of total target compensation is based in part on size parameters since the Company is competing with similar sized companies for executive talent. For the performance awards, size is less of a consideration and more emphasis is placed on multi‑family peers since operating performance and shareholder return are more appropriately compared with direct competitors in our specific industry.
For the 2016 - 2018 performance awards relating to three‑year relative TSR, the following indices were used:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FTSE NAREIT Apartment Total Return Index represents REITs in the multifamily housing industry across the U.S. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FTSE NAREIT Equity REITS Index represents a comprehensive group of REITs that spans a variety of commercial real estate space (such as retail, office, storage and multifamily) across the U.S. 
[END TABLE]
For the 2016 - 2018 performance awards relating to operating metrics, the following multifamily REITs were used as peer companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– Apartment Investment and Management Company 
– Camden Property Trust 
– Equity Residential 
– Essex Property Trust, Inc. 
– Mid‑America Apartment Communities, Inc. 
– Post Properties, Inc. 
– UDR, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
These companies were chosen primarily because they are publicly-traded companies in the multifamily industry.
Please note that Post Properties was acquired in December 2016.  For companies that were acquired during the performance period, their operating metrics were factored in for the portion of the performance period for which they were publicly traded companies that published operating results.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Who Are our Compensation Consultants 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has engaged Steven Hall & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm, to provide it with advice and counsel on executive compensation as well as competitive pay practices. Steven Hall & Partners did not provide any services directly to the Company or its management. Management uses the services of FPL Associates, another compensation consulting firm, to provide it with information about competitive pay practices and data. The Compensation Committee undertook an assessment of whether any material conflict of interest exists in connection with the services of Steven Hall & Partners to the Compensation Committee or the services of FPL Associates to management and concluded that there was no such material conflict of interest.
With respect to the three-year performance awards relating to TSR, the Company utilizes FAS Solutions Inc. to provide the Monte Carlo valuation.

How We Establish Goals and Determine Achievement for Incentive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Setting Goals:  At the beginning of the year, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the Company's business plan and budget. Subsequently, the Company's management proposes corporate goals for that year for the annual bonus program and long‑term incentive program. The Compensation Committee reviews these proposed goals, adopts any revisions it may deem appropriate, and recommends the final corporate goals to the full Board of Directors for ratification and approval by a vote of the independent directors who would qualify for membership on the Compensation Committee.
Annual business unit goals are drafted by the head of each business unit and reviewed, modified and approved by the Chief Executive Officer.
The individual goals for the annual bonus program are determined in a similar manner, with the exception that the goals for the Chief Executive Officer are determined by the Compensation Committee and ratified by the independent directors of the Board who would qualify for membership on the Compensation Committee.
Determining Achievement:  At the end of each year, the Chief Executive Officer reviews and recommends to the Compensation Committee his assessment of the achievement of corporate goals for both the annual bonus program and the long‑term incentive program, and the business unit and individual goals for the annual bonus program for the other Named Executive Officers. Recommendations for bonus awards and compensation changes for the Chief Executive Officer and all executive officers are approved by the Compensation Committee and are then ratified by the independent directors who qualify for membership on the Compensation Committee.
Design of the Annual Cash Incentive Program:  Our annual bonus program emphasizes short term goals and is paid in cash.
Three components are measured to determine performance under the 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Program: Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate performance, consisting of Core FFO per share, Development and Redevelopment NOI, development yield and management performance 
• Business unit performance (applies to all Named Executive Officers except the Chief Executive Officer) 
• Individual performance 
[END TABLE]
Why These Performance Measures are Selected:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Corporate Performance Rationale 
Core FFO per Share Core FFO per share (or similar measures such as Operating FFO) is a key metric used by many REITS and tracked by equity research analysts.   Core FFO per Share is reported in our quarterly results and periodic guidance to the market.

Development Lease-Up NOI and Redevelopment NOI vs. Budget Development and redevelopment are core competencies of the Company that contribute to value creation. Development and Redevelopment NOI are profit related measures that are important to fulfillment of the annual business plan. NOI helps investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets.

Development Completions (Yield vs. Target Yield) Development yield (i.e., projected NOI/total capital cost) is a return measure that reflects the economic returns from a development community as a percentage of the capital we invested in it.    As a performance measure, we measure development yield on completed developments (once the development achieves stabilized occupancy) against the target yield we have for that asset.

Management's Performance vs. Goals There are two components to the qualitative assessment of management's performance: (i) strategic and corporate initiatives, and (ii) management effectiveness, where we gauge ourselves against pre‑established annual and multi-year goals. 
Review of 2018 Performance and Pay 
[END TABLE]
Annual Cash and Stock Incentive Program:
The goals, metrics and achievement for the corporate component of the 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Program are graphically illustrated in the following charts. Total performance under all corporate goals was determined to be 117.9% of target. Table of Contents Table of Contents
Individual Goals and Achievement for Annual Cash Component
Individual goals for the officers include the executive's leadership and managerial performance, as well as specific objectives, and are evaluated on a subjective basis annually. Individual performance for Mr. Naughton was determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also determined individual performance for the other Named Executive Officers after receiving recommendations from Mr. Naughton.

Annual Stock Bonus Component
Each of the Named Executive Officers had an annual stock bonus component in their total pay package in 2018. Mr. Naughton's annual stock bonus is based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative factors, as described below. Messrs. O'Shea, Breslin, Birenbaum and Wilson each received an annual stock bonus based upon the achievement of their business unit goals. When the annual stock bonus award is earned, it is awarded in the form of restricted stock that vests ratably over three years, based on continued employment but subject to earlier acceleration of vesting in the event of a termination due to death, disability, termination without cause, or retirement.
Mr. Naughton: Mr. Naughton's performance measures for his annual stock bonus consisted of the following: (i) same store controllable NOI vs budget; (ii) customer service – NPS; (iii) review and assessment of overall construction performance, including budget, quality, schedule and safety; (iv) review and assessment of development starts and completions against plan; and (v) talent development and succession planning. Mr. Naughton's achievement for 2018 was determined to be 121.6% of target. Table of Contents
Mr. O'Shea:  Mr. O'Shea's business unit component was based on the achievements of the Financial Services Group, for which Mr. O'Shea has direct supervisory responsibility. The Financial Services Group includes the areas of capital markets, accounting, financial reporting, financial planning and analysis, risk management, tax, internal audit (for which he has administrative oversight), investor relations, and investment fund management, as well as our call center operations which support our apartment communities.

For 2018, the overall achievement for Mr. Wilson's business unit was determined to be 74.0% of target.
Long‑Term Incentive Program:
Design of the Long‑Term Incentive Program:  Under our multi‑year, long‑term incentive award program, performance awards are granted each year with a target number of performance units that may be reduced or increased at the end of the three year performance period depending on achievement against established metrics. For the 2018-2020 performance period, the performance units that are earned at the end of the performance period are settled in Common Stock.  In addition to receiving one share of fully vested stock for each unit earned as determined at the end of the performance period, a cash payment will made equal to the dividends that accrued on such number of earned shares during the performance period. 
The metrics under the performance awards made in 2018 with a three‑year performance period ending on December 31, 2020 are as follows:

(3) The peers used in calculating each of the Operating Performance Metrics include: Apartment Investment and Management Company, Mid‑America Apartment Communities, Inc., Camden Property Trust, Equity Residential, Essex Property Trust, Inc., and UDR, Inc. Operating metrics for companies that are acquired during the performance period will be factored in for the portion of the performance period for which they were publicly traded companies that published operating results. 
[END TABLE]
Why These Performance Measures are Selected
The performance awards strengthen the alignment of executive compensation with long‑term stockholder value creation. Our Named Executive Officers have the opportunity to earn shares of AvalonBay Common Stock with a value that adjusts based on absolute increases in our stock price as well as AvalonBay's TSR relative to the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index and FTSE NAREIT Apartments Index. These two indices are selected because they represent the broader REIT industry and the REIT apartment industry, respectively.
Operating metrics in the form of Core FFO per share growth and Net Debt‑to‑Core EBITDA ratio against peers are chosen to motivate our officers to focus on critical operating performance objectives that we believe will contribute to sustainable stockholder returns over the long term.

(1) To derive the target number of units, 60% of the target dollar value (representing the portion of the award tied to TSR Metrics) was divided by the Monte Carlo value as of February 14, 2019 (the approval date) for a unit based solely on the TSR metrics ($204.15 per unit) and 40% of the target dollar value (representing the portion of the award tied to Operating Metrics) was divided by the closing price of the Common Stock on February 14, 2019 ($195.72 per share). Such awards are not subject to further additional time vesting requirements following completion of the three-year performance period.

Other Benefits 
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to our Deferred Compensation Plan, certain employees, including the Named Executive Officers, may defer up to 25% of base annual salary and up to 50% of annual cash bonus on a pre‑tax basis and receive a tax‑deferred return on those deferrals. Deferral elections are made by eligible employees during an open enrollment period each year for amounts to be earned in the following year. Participating employees direct the deemed investment of their deferral accounts by selecting among certain available investments in mutual funds.
We have an employee stock purchase plan that allows our employees the opportunity to purchase up to $25,000 of our Common Stock per year at a 15% discount to the lower of the closing price of the Common Stock, as reported on the NYSE, on the first business day of the purchase period or the closing price of the Common Stock on the last day of the purchase period. For 2018 there were two purchase periods, January 1 – June 10 and July 1 – December 10, with the opportunity to purchase up to $12,500 of our Common Stock at the discounted rate previously mentioned during each of the two purchase periods (up to $25,000 annually). In addition, we maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan and match 50% of the contributions up to the first six percent of a participant's eligible compensation (subject to certain tax limitations). We offer medical, dental and vision plans, a portion of the cost of which is paid by the employee. We also provide life insurance, accidental dismemberment insurance, and short‑term and long‑term disability insurance for each employee.

Compensation Policies 
[END TABLE]
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines.  The Company believes that stock ownership by its executive officers is important and has established formal Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines for officers who are at the executive vice president level or above or are subject to reporting under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. These guidelines provide that persons holding the title of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or President are expected to maintain ownership of Common Stock (including unvested restricted shares) equal to six times their base salary. The multiples that apply to other covered officers are as follows: Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice Presidents—three times; Senior Vice Presidents—one and one‑half times; Vice Presidents—one time. The full text of the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines, which includes the time periods by which such ownership must be achieved and a retention policy during periods of non‑achievement, is posted on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate Governance Documents."  Table of Contents
The Company also has Director Stock Ownership Guidelines as discussed in the "Director Compensation and Director Stock Ownership Guidelines" section of the proxy statement.
Prohibition Against Hedging, Pledging or Borrowing Against Company Stock. AvalonBay's current Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, as most recently amended by the Board of Directors as of May 23, 2018, provide that, "No Covered Person may sell any Security of the Company if he or she does not own the Security at the time of the sale (a 'short sale').  No Covered Person may buy or sell puts or calls in respect of any Company Securities. No Covered Person may borrow money from a broker or other lender that is secured by Company Securities (a 'margin' loan), and no Covered Person may hold Company Securities in a marginable brokerage account."  A "Covered Person" includes (i) directors, officers and selected associates of the Company; (ii) each immediate family member of each such person sharing such person's household and/or not financially independent of such person; and (iii) each trust, account, or other entity over which a Covered Person has direct or indirect investment power or authority.  "Securities" include equity and debt securities of AvalonBay (common and preferred stock and publicly traded debt securities), and options or other derivative securities in respect of such securities.
Severance Policy.  In 2012, the Board adopted a Policy Regarding Shareholder Approval of Future Severance Agreements (the "Severance Policy"). The Severance Policy generally provides that the Company will not, without stockholder approval or ratification, enter into or bind the Company to the terms of any severance agreement entered into after adoption of the policy with a senior executive officer that provides for severance benefits (as defined) in excess of 2.99 times the sum of the officer's base salary plus annual bonus. The Severance Policy, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate Governance Documents," provides additional detail regarding the application of this policy.
Policy on Recoupment of Incentive Compensation (Clawback Policy).  The Board has adopted a Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation (i.e., a compensation clawback policy), which applies to senior officers (generally senior vice presidents and above). Pursuant to this policy, in the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material non‑compliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement, then an independent committee of the Board of Directors may require any covered officer to repay to the Company all or part of any "Excess Compensation" that such officer had previously received. Excess Compensation is defined as that part of the cash or equity incentive compensation received by a covered officer during the three‑year period preceding the publication of the restated financial statement that was in excess of the amount that such officer would have received had such incentive compensation been calculated based on the financial results reported in the restated financial statement. The full text of the policy is posted on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website (www.avalonbay.com) under "Corporate Governance Documents."

Risk Considerations 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviewed and considered risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for its employees. This review included consideration of the following specific elements of the Company's executive compensation policies and procedures: Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual bonus and long‑term incentive awards are based upon pre‑existing, defined goals; 
• annual goals contain multiple financial targets, including performance against a pre‑approved budget; 
• performance goals include both absolute performance and performance relative to industry peers; 
• annual goals balance financial and non‑financial performance; 
• goals include corporate, business unit, and individual performance goals; 
• performance goals include achievement against both single year and multi-year metrics; 
• executive compensation is structured as a mix among salary, cash bonus, and equity awards; 
• equity awards vest over time or based upon achievement of pre-determined goals; 
• bonus and long‑term equity programs include maximum payouts or "caps"; 
• all unvested equity awards are forfeited upon a termination for cause or voluntary termination under certain circumstances; 
• the metrics that are included in our long‑term performance awards include a goal addressing appropriate leverage ratios; 
• achievement of metrics is not determined on an "all or nothing" basis, but rather goals may be achieved on a graduated basis based on performance against the stated target; and 
• while awards are generally made in relation to performance against specific goals, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to adjust annual bonuses of cash and restricted stock as may be warranted by specific circumstances. 
Section 162(m) 
[END TABLE]
The SEC requires that this report comment upon the Company's policy with respect to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Tax Code"), which limits the deductibility on the Company's tax return of compensation over $1 million to certain executive or former executive officers unless, in general, for the tax years prior to 2018, the compensation is paid pursuant to a plan which is performance‑related, non‑discretionary and has been approved by the Company's stockholders. Although certain qualifying "performance-based compensation" was previously exempt from this deduction limit, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made certain changes to Section 162(m) of the Tax Code.  Pursuant to such changes, "performance-based compensation" is no longer exempt under Section 162(m) effective for tax years beginning after January 1, 2017, subject to a transition rule for written binding contracts which were in effect on November 2, 2017, and which were not modified in any material respect on or after such date. The Company believes that, because it qualifies as a REIT under the Tax Code and pays dividends sufficient to minimize federal income taxes, the payment of compensation that does not satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) will generally not affect the Company's net income. If that compensation does not qualify for a deduction under Section 162(m), there could be a modest effect on the Company's dividend requirements to qualify as a REIT or on the tax characterization of such dividends. The Company does not believe that Section 162(m) will materially affect its dividend requirements or the taxability of stockholder distributions, although no assurance can be given in this regard due to the variety of factors that affect the tax position of each stockholder. For these reasons, the Compensation Committee's compensation policy and practices are not directly guided by considerations relating to Section 162(m). Table of Contents

(2) The amounts in column (e) include restricted stock actually granted during the fiscal year for service in the prior fiscal year. For example, the row for 2018 includes the value of stock awards made in February 2018 with respect to 2017 service. 
(3) The amounts in column (e) reflect the aggregate grant date fair value for awards made in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for restricted stock awards and performance unit awards made pursuant to the Company's 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. The value of restricted stock awards is based solely on the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant and no assumptions were used in the calculation of this value. The value of performance unit awards based on Operating Metrics established in 2018 for measurement period 2018 - 2020 is based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant of $161.10. The value of performance unit awards based on TSR metrics made in 2018 for measurement period 2018‑2020 is based on the Monte Carlo value of $151.67. The total value of 2018‑2020 performance unit awards, if earned at maximum and valued at the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant, for the Named Executive Officers is: Mr. Naughton-$10,891,649, Messrs. Birenbaum and Breslin-$2,427,133, Mr. O'Shea-$2,178,394, and Mr. Wilson-$1,193,107.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Pursuant to our Deferred Compensation Plan, certain employees of the Company, including the Named Executive Officers, may defer up to 25% of base annual salary and up to 50% of annual cash bonus on a pre‑tax basis and receive a tax‑deferred return on those deferrals. Deferral elections are made by eligible employees during an open enrollment period each year for amounts to be earned in the following year. Participating employees direct the deemed investment of their deferral accounts by selecting among certain available investment funds. The table below shows the investment funds available under the Deferred Compensation Plan and their annual rate of return for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018. Since the investment funds are all publicly available, we do not consider any of the earnings credited under the Deferred Compensation Plan to be "above market". Table of Contents

 Table of Contents
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Sale Event
The summaries below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete plans and agreements described, which have been included as exhibits to the Company's SEC filings.
The Company is not party to employment agreements with any individual executive officers.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Officer Severance Plan for Sale Events 
[END TABLE]
We adopted an Officer Severance Plan for sale events. Under this program, in the event an officer is terminated (other than for cause) in connection with or within 24 months of a sale of the Company (as defined therein), such officer will generally receive a multiple of his Covered Compensation (defined as the sum of his annual base salary plus the average of his or her last two annual cash bonuses as of the termination date) depending on the officer's title: for the Chief Executive Officer, the multiple is three times, for the Chief Financial Officer or an Executive Vice President, the multiple is two times, and for other officers the multiple is one times. The terminated officer would also receive (i) a cash payment representing the pro rata value of his or her annual bonus (cash and stock) for the portion of the year worked, valued at target, (ii) accelerated vesting of the officer's unvested restricted stock and options, and (iii) payment of COBRA insurance premiums for up to 18 months.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Other Severance Arrangements 
[END TABLE]
Our agreements with our directors and officers governing compensatory stock option and restricted stock awards provide for vesting (and, in the case of stock options, exercisability for one year) if a "sale event" with respect to the Company occurs and the participant's employment or other business relationship with the Company terminates for good reason or without cause in connection with or within 24 months following the sale event (as each such term is defined therein).
In addition, upon death, disability, termination without cause, or the retirement of an employee (as defined in the award agreements under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan), (a) all of such employee's options shall automatically become fully exercisable and (absent a specific agreement providing otherwise) shall be exercisable for one year thereafter and (b) all of such employee's restricted shares of stock shall automatically vest 30 days following the triggering event; provided, at the Company's option, that a separation agreement is executed and effective during such 30-day period. Retirement of an employee as defined in the award agreements under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan generally means the termination of employment, other than for cause, when the sum of the following equals or exceeds 70 years: (i) the number of full months (converted to years) of employment and other business relationships with the Company and any predecessor company (must be at least 120 months) and (ii) the employee's age on the date of termination (must be at least 50 years old). To qualify for retirement, the employee must also give six months' prior written notice to the Company of the employee's intention to retire and enter into a release and a one year non‑solicitation and non‑competition agreement with us.
Under this formula, Messrs. Naughton and Wilson are currently eligible for retirement, and Messrs. O'Shea, Birenbaum, and Breslin will become eligible for retirement in October 2019, June 2020, and December 2019, respectively.
Our multi-year performance awards under which restricted stock units are awarded and may be earned at the end of a performance period are not subject to the terms described above, but any restricted stock granted in settlement of units once a performance period is complete are subject to these terms. For performance awards, following one full year of employment during the performance period, a pro rata portion of the award will be paid at the end of the performance period based on actual achievement if there is a separation of employment due to death, disability, retirement, or a termination without cause. If a sale event occurs during a performance period, then all outstanding performance awards vest at their target number of units and stock is issued for such number of units but subject (in the case of awards made before January 1, 2018) to the three year time based vesting described above for compensatory restricted stock, if applicable.

1. Upon termination of any employee's employment due to a qualified retirement as described above, in addition to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and performance awards, the employee will receive their prorated annual bonus (cash and stock) paid in cash, six months of Company-paid COBRA premiums, and choice of retirement gift from an online catalog.  Retirement benefits are available on the same terms to all associates. 
2. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors from time to time reviews and establishes severance guidelines in the case of a termination without cause of an executive officer.  The guidelines do not constitute a contractual right of an executive and are subject to change without notice as business needs and practices evolve.  The Company may require that certain conditions be met before providing severance to an executive, such as requiring the executive to execute a general release, to continue employment with the Company for a period of time, to provide on-going cooperation on various matters, etc.  As well, the severance amount suggested in the guideline may be decreased, or eliminated, on a case by case basis depending on the nature of the executive's termination (e.g., reorganization, poor performance, etc.).   
[END TABLE]
In the absence of a decrease in the current guideline amount, the guidelines suggest a cash severance payment of two times base salary plus target cash bonus in the case of Mr. Naughton ($6,000,000 as of December 31, 2018) and one and one-half times base salary plus target cash bonus in the case of the other named executive officers ($2,025,000 for Messrs. O'Shea, Breslin and Birenbaum and $1,575,000 for Mr. Wilson as of December 31, 2018).  As well, the terminated executive would be paid a cash amount in consideration of the annual cash bonus and annual stock bonus that would have been earned for the portion of the year worked prior to termination ($4,496,500, $1,612,700, $1,843,860, $1,734,660, and $938,740 in the case of Messrs. Naughton, O'Shea, Breslin, Birenbaum, and Wilson, respectively, for a termination at December 31, 2018).  Actual earned 2018 figures are used for termination at the end of the calendar year.  
Outstanding equity awards would vest in accordance with their terms as is the case with other equity award participants who are terminated without cause, which is reflected in the Termination Without Cause (Unrelated to a Sale Event) column. Table of Contents

3. In accordance with the terms of the Company's Officer Severance Plan (as adopted on September 9, 1999, and amended and restated on November 18, 2008, November 9, 2011, and February 11, 2016) represents three times covered compensation (base salary and the average of the prior two year's cash bonuses) for Mr. Naughton.  
4. For 2016-2018 awards, value based on actual achievement. For 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 awards, value assumes prorated vesting based on portion of the performance period completed and achievement assumed at target. 
5. For 2016-2018 awards, value based on actual achievement.  For 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 awards, value based on full vesting at target.

Director Compensation and Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
A director of the Company who is also an employee receives no additional compensation for his services as a director. Our Board and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically assess the total compensation for non‑employee directors relative to the compensation provided by similarly sized real estate investment trusts, by our multi‑family peer group, and by a group of cross‑industry similarly sized companies.
On the fifth business day following the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, each of our non‑employee directors automatically received a grant of a number of shares of restricted stock (or a deferred stock award in lieu thereof) equal to $140,000 divided by the closing price of Common Stock as reported by the NYSE on the date of grant. Based on this formula, following the 2018 Annual Meeting, each non‑employee director received a restricted stock or deferred stock grant of 846 shares of Common Stock. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the value of the annual equity award to non-employee directors will increase to $160,000. All of such shares of restricted stock (or deferred stock awards) granted to non‑employee directors vest in four quarterly installments over a one-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon departure from the Board except in the case of a voluntary departure by the director during the director's elected term that is not due to death or disability, or the director's removal for cause. If a director elected to receive a deferred stock award in lieu of restricted stock, then the director will receive shares of stock in respect of the vested portion of the deferred stock award within 30 days following termination of service as a director of the Company.
In addition, during 2018 non‑employee directors received $85,000 as an annual retainer paid in two installments of $20,000 and two installments of $22,500. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors will remain at a rate of $90,000 per year, paid in quarterly installments. Non‑employee directors who served as the chairperson of the Audit or Compensation Committees during 2018 received additional cash compensation of $20,000, paid in four installments of $5,000 (or a deferred stock award in lieu of cash).  Non-employee directors who served as the chairperson of the Investment and Finance or Nominating and Governance Committees during 2018 received additional cash compensation of $15,000, paid in four installments of $3,750 (or a deferred stock award in lieu of cash). Beginning with  the 2019 Annual Meeting, the additional fee paid to the chairperson of the Audit Committee will increase to a rate of $25,000 per year.  The chairperson of each of the remaining Committees will receive the same amount of additional cash compensation as in 2018.  The chairperson of the Compensation Committee will continue to receive $20,000 and the chairperson of the Investment and Finance or Nominating and Governance Committees will receive $15,000 in additional cash compensation, in each case payable in four equal installments.
In consideration for serving as Lead Independent Director for 2018, Mr. Sarles received, in addition to the compensation described above, an annual fee of $30,000 paid in equal installments of $7,500. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting the annual fee payable to the Lead Independent Director will continue at that rate.
Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, non‑employee directors are generally required to hold shares (or deferred stock units) having a value that equals or exceeds five times the annual cash retainer paid to non‑employee directors. Directors have five years from the commencement of their service as a director to comply with such requirement.
The following table sets forth the compensation for service as a director of the Company received by each non‑employee director in 2018, as recognized for financial reporting purposes. Table of Contents

CEO Pay Ratio
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, we are required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to our median paid employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer.  
The following describes our methodology and the resulting Chief Executive Officer pay ratio and is a reasonable estimate, based on all individuals employed by AvalonBay Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 2018.  To identify the median employee, we utilized wages reported in Box 1 of IRS Form W-2.  Box 1 pay was selected as the most appropriate, consistently applied compensation measure as it captures compensation earned through various incentive plans offered throughout the Company. Wages were annualized for employees who joined the Company during 2018. For employees who were hired in late December 2018 and did not receive wages until early 2019, wages were assumed to be below the median.  After identifying the median employee based on W-2 wages, total compensation for the median employee was calculated using the same methodology as was used for calculating the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.  The annual total compensation for 2018 for the Chief Executive Officer was $10,079,434 and for the median employee was $61,642, which is comprised of approximately $55,000 in cash compensation and $6,500 in all other compensation, such as 401(k) Company contributions and Company paid health care benefits.  As a result, the estimated ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's pay to the pay of the median employee is 163.5 to 1.
In an effort to provide additional context on the pay ratio disclosure, the Company is providing the following background information.  The employee identified as the employee with median compensation, as described above, held the position of a community consultant in our New York/New Jersey region.  As of January 31, 2019, we had 3,087 employees, of which 2,182 were employed on-site at our operating apartment communities and 84 employees are employed on a part-time basis.  The total population also includes 195 employees at the Customer Care Center, our in-house administrative support and call center located in Virginia Beach, VA. The average tenure of all employees is approximately 5.8 years. The Company generally staffs its business with full time employees and not part-time employees or the employees of subcontractors; we do however use subcontractors on occasion to supplement the staffing at certain operating communities and we do on occasion use part time or seasonal employees.  With regard to our development and construction activities, we engage various other firms to actually engage in the professional design and construction of our communities (i.e., architectural plans, engineering plans, foundation work, carpentry, drywall, framing, etc.).  
As disclosed in the "CD&A", AvalonBay's total compensation program is designed to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate talent within the Company, 
• Align the interests of management with the interests of stockholders, 
• Direct performance with clearly defined goals and measures of achievement, and 
• Assure that compensation is aligned with performance.

In accordance with Rule 16a‑3(c) under the Exchange Act, the Company has designated the NYSE as the national securities exchange with which reports pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act need to be filed.

To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of copies of such reports and written representations that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all filing requirements applicable to the Insiders were timely satisfied.
