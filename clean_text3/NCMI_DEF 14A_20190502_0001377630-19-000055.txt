[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the difference between holding NCM, Inc.'s shares of common stock as a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner? 
A: Most of our stockholders hold their shares of our common stock as a beneficial owner through a broker, bank or other nominee in "street name" rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some important distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially in "street name." 
  Stockholder of Record: If your shares of our common stock are registered directly in your name, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and we delivered these proxy materials directly to you. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote your shares in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Owner: If your shares of our common stock are held in an account with a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares held in "street name," and the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares on your behalf delivered these proxy materials to you. The nominee holding your shares is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares being held by them.

As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares being held by them.
Q: If I am a stockholder of record of NCM, Inc. shares, how do I vote? 
A: Voting by Internet. You can vote through the Internet by following the instructions provided in the proxy card that you received. Go to www.edocumentview.com/ncmi, follow the instructions on the screen to log in, make your selections as instructed and vote. 
  Voting by Mail. You can vote by mail by completing, dating, signing and returning the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope (to which no postage need be affixed if mailed in the United States) accompanying the proxy card that you received. Voting in Person. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, we will give you a ballot at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you also to vote by Internet or mail as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.

Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also vote by Internet or mail as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.

Q: What if I submit a proxy but I do not give specific voting instructions? 
A: Stockholder of Record: If you are a stockholder of record of shares of our common stock, and if you indicate when voting through the Internet that you wish to vote as recommended by our Board of Directors, or if you sign and return a proxy without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders designated by our Board of Directors, Clifford Marks and Sarah Hilty, who are officers of the Company, will vote your shares FOR the eight director nominees; FOR advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation, and FOR the ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors for our 2019 fiscal year, all as recommended by our Board of Directors and as presented in this proxy statement. 
  Beneficial Owner: If you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held in "street name" and do not present the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then the nominee may generally vote your shares on "routine" proposals but cannot vote on your behalf for "non-routine" proposals under the rules of various securities exchanges. If you do not provide specific voting instructions to the nominee that holds your shares with respect to a non-routine proposal, the nominee will not have the authority to vote your shares on that proposal. When a broker indicates on a proxy that it does not have authority to vote shares on a particular proposal, the missing votes are referred to as "broker non-votes." 
Q: Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors for fiscal 2019 (Proposal No. 3) is a matter considered routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal No. 3. The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) and the advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation (Proposal No. 2) are matters considered non-routine under applicable rules. A bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore there may be broker non-votes on Proposal Nos. 1 and 2. A broker non-vote will have no effect on Proposal Nos. 1 and 2. 
Q: What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting? 
A: A quorum is required for our stockholders to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting in order to hold the meeting and conduct business. We will count your shares for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum if you are present in person at the Annual Meeting, if you have voted through the Internet, if you have voted by properly submitting a proxy card, or if the nominee holding your shares submits a proxy card. We will also count broker non-votes for the purpose of determining if there is a quorum. 
Q: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
A: For Proposal No. 1, each director will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the eight director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by the holders of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected as directors. You are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors and may not vote for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. 
  Approval of Proposal No. 2, on an advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.  Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. The effectiveness of any of the proposals is not conditioned upon the approval by our stockholders of any other proposal by our stockholders. Standard General L.P. which holds 15.4 million shares or 19.4% of our outstanding common stock, has agreed to vote the shares of our common stock that it beneficially owns in favor of each nominee for director in Proposal No. 1 and in favor of Proposal No. 3 as required by the terms of the letter agreement between the Company and Standard General dated June 1, 2018.
  Approval of Proposal No. 2, on an advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.  Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. The effectiveness of any of the proposals is not conditioned upon the approval by our stockholders of any other proposal by our stockholders. Standard General L.P. which holds 15.4 million shares or 19.4% of our outstanding common stock, has agreed to vote the shares of our common stock that it beneficially owns in favor of each nominee for director in Proposal No. 1 and in favor of Proposal No. 3 as required by the terms of the letter agreement between the Company and Standard General dated June 1, 2018.
  Approval of Proposal No. 2, on an advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.  Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote that are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.

Q: How are abstentions treated? 
A: Abstentions will be counted as present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. A vote withheld for a nominee in the election of directors (Proposal No. 1) will have no effect on the election of the director nominee, although if a director who is not designated pursuant to contractual rights is elected by a plurality of votes cast but fails to receive a majority of votes cast, the director must tender his or her resignation to the Board for its consideration. For purposes of determining whether any of the other proposals have received the requisite vote, if a stockholder abstains from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal. 
Q: Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I have voted? 
A: Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before its use by delivering to us (Attention: Secretary) a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in itself constitute a revocation of a proxy. 
Q: Who is paying for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
A: We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. We have retained Georgeson as our proxy solicitor and we will pay Georgeson approximately $5,500, plus expenses. Proxies may be solicited by our regular employees, without additional compensation, in person or by mail, courier, telephone or facsimile. We may also make arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons.

Vote Required
Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the holders of shares present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting.
Director Resignation Policy
It is the Company's desire that any director elected to the Board of Directors in an uncontested election shall receive a majority vote of stockholders. As such, in the event of an uncontested election where a nominee not designated pursuant to a contractual right is elected by a plurality but not a majority of votes cast, the director will tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to the resignation. The Board will decide to accept or reject such resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days from the date of certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board may consider such factors or other information they deem appropriate and relevant in deciding whether to accept or reject a resignation tendered in accordance with this policy. A director whose resignation is under consideration will abstain from participating in any decision regarding the resignation. If the nominee is designated pursuant to a contractual right, the Company will consult with the designating entity about the possibility of a different candidate at the following year's annual meeting.
Recommendation
Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR each of the nominees for director. If not otherwise specified, proxies will be voted FOR each of the nominees for director.
Independence of our Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors has determined that Andrew P. Glaze, Lawrence A. Goodman, David R. Haas, Thomas F. Lesinski and Mark B. Segall, all current directors of the Company, qualify as "independent" directors under the rules promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, and by Nasdaq. There are no family relationships among any of our executive officers, directors or nominees for director. For further detail of related party transactions, refer to "Certain Relationship and Related Party Transactions" located elsewhere in this document.
Company Leadership Structure Our Board determined to split the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Our Interim Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day to day leadership and performance of the Company, while our Chairman sets the agenda for Board meetings and presides over meetings of the full Board in its oversight role. We believe this leadership structure will best serve the objectives of our Board's oversight of management, our Board's ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of our stockholders, and the Company's overall corporate governance.
Mr. Lesinski assumed the position of Chairman of our Board of Directors on August 1, 2018.
Our Board plans to periodically review the leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve the Company and our stockholders.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Our Board as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, including setting the "tone at the top" regarding the importance of risk management. Our Board reviews information on the Company's credit, liquidity and operations, as well as reports from management on enterprise risk and committee reports. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation. Our Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of financial risks, including cybersecurity risks. Our Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks associated with board independence and potential conflicts of interests. While each committee is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed of each committee's analysis.
Katherine L. Scherping, Chief Financial Officer is our Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer provides periodic updates to our Board on the strategic, operational, financial, cybersecurity, compliance and reputational risks facing the Company, which serves to ensure that risk management is a priority within the organization and the Company's risk oversight is aligned with its strategies. 
Compensation Risk Assessment
We do not believe we have compensation practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Our Compensation Committee reviews the compensation policies and practices for all employees, including executive officers. Among other things, our Compensation Committee considers whether the compensation program encourages excessive risk taking by employees at the expense of long-term Company value. Based upon its assessment, our Compensation Committee does not believe that our compensation program encourages excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. Our Compensation Committee believes that the design of our compensation program, which includes a mix of annual and long-term incentives, cash and equity awards and retention incentives, is balanced and does not motivate imprudent risk-taking.
Meetings of our Board of Directors and Standing Committees
Our Board of Directors held eighteen meetings during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2018. During our 2018 fiscal year, no director then in office attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate total number of meetings of our Board of Directors held during the period in which he or she was a director and of the total number of meetings held by all of the committees of our Board of Directors on which he or she served. The Company does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of our Board of Directors at the Company's Annual Meeting, but encourages our directors to attend. Eight of our then nine directors attended our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on July 6, 2018. The three standing committees of our Board of Directors are our Audit Committee, our Compensation Committee and our Nominating and Governance Committee. Periodically our Board has established a special committee to review significant transactions and other matters. 
The following table shows the current membership:

(3) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditor; and 
(4) confirming compliance with laws and regulations, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system on which our securities may be listed. 
[END TABLE]
Our Audit Committee also is responsible for establishing procedures for the receipt of complaints regarding our accounting, internal accounting controls or audit matters, and the confidential, anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Our Audit Committee's responsibilities are set forth in its charter, the current version of which was most recently reviewed by the Committee and approved by our Board in January 2019 in conjunction with the charter's annual review. The current version of the charter is available on our website at www.ncm.com at the Investor Relations link. There were ten meetings of our Audit Committee during our 2018 fiscal year.
Compensation Committee
Our Compensation Committee consists of Mark B. Segall (chairman), Andrew P. Glaze, Lawrence A. Goodman, and David R. Haas. Each member was determined to be "independent" as defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act and by Nasdaq, and each also qualifies as an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.
Our Compensation Committee's purposes, as set forth in its charter, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) to assist our Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to compensation of our CEO and other executives; 
(2) to administer our equity incentive plans (other than equity compensation for non-employee directors which is administered by our Board); and 
(3) to have overall responsibility for approving and evaluating all of our compensation plans, policies and programs that affect our executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee's responsibilities are set forth in its charter, which is reviewed at least annually. The current Compensation Committee charter was most recently reviewed by the Committee and approved by our Board in January 2019. The current version of the charter is available on our website at www.ncm.com at the Investor Relations link. There were seven meetings of our Compensation Committee during our 2018 fiscal year.
Our Compensation Committee engaged ClearBridge Compensation Group, LLC ("ClearBridge"), a nationally recognized consulting firm, to assess the competitiveness of compensation for the executive officers and provide independent  advice and recommendations to our Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation. Prior to retaining ClearBridge, our Compensation Committee reviewed ClearBridge's independence as contemplated by the committee's charter and applicable Nasdaq rules, and determined that there were no conflicts of interest and that ClearBridge is independent from the Company, our Compensation Committee and our executive officers.
Nominating and Governance Committee
Our Nominating and Governance Committee consists of Andrew P. Glaze (Chairman), Lawrence A. Goodman, and Mark B. Segall. Each of the members of our Nominating and Governance Committee was determined to be independent in accordance with Nasdaq rules and relevant federal securities laws and regulations.
Our Nominating and Governance Committee's purposes, as set forth in its charter, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) to identify individuals qualified to become Board members, and to recommend director nominees to our Board; 
(2) to oversee the evaluation of our Board; and 
(3) to review from time to time the Corporate Governance Guidelines applicable to us and to recommend to our Board such changes as it may deem appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
Our Nominating and Governance Committee's responsibilities are set forth in its charter, which was most recently reviewed by the Committee and approved by our Board in January 2019. The current version of the charter as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at www.ncm.com at the Investor Relations link. There were nine meetings of our Nominating and Governance Committee during our 2018 fiscal year.
Other than the director candidates designated by our founding members or by Standard General pursuant to the Letter Agreement, our Nominating and Governance Committee identifies individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends director nominees to our Board for each annual meeting of stockholders or in connection with filling a vacancy on our Board between annual meetings. It also reviews the qualifications and independence of the members of our Board of Directors and its various committees on a regular basis and makes any recommendations the committee members may deem appropriate from time to time concerning any changes in the overall composition of our Board of Directors and its committees. Our Nominating and Governance Committee recommends to our Board of Directors the terms of our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Nominating and Governance Committee reviews such guidelines and the provisions of our Nominating and Governance Committee charter on a regular basis to confirm that such guidelines and charter remain consistent with sound corporate governance practices and with any legal, regulatory or Nasdaq requirements. Our Nominating and Governance Committee also monitors our Board of Directors and our compliance with any commitments made to regulators or otherwise regarding changes in corporate governance practices and leads our Board of Directors in its annual review of our Board of Directors.
Nomination of Directors. The nominees for election to our Board of Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting were formally nominated by our Nominating and Governance Committee, and were approved by our Board of Directors on February 19, 2019. All the nominees are current directors.
As the need to fill vacancies arises in the future, our Nominating and Governance Committee will refer to its list of potential candidates that is maintained and updated on an on-going basis and will seek individuals qualified to become Board members for recommendation to our Board. Our Nominating and Governance Committee would consider potential director candidates recommended by stockholders and use the same criteria for screening all candidates, regardless of who proposed such candidates. See "Stockholder Communications" below for information on how our stockholders may communicate with our Board of Directors. See "Proposals of Stockholders" below for further information on making director nominations.
Our Nominating and Governance Committee and Board of Directors consider whether candidates for nomination to our Board of Directors possess the following qualifications, among others:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) the highest level of personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values; 
(b) expertise that is useful to us and is complementary to the background and expertise of the other members of our Board of Directors; 
(c) a willingness and ability to devote the time necessary to carry out the duties and responsibilities of membership on our Board of Directors; 
(d) a desire to ensure that our operations and financial reporting are effected in a transparent manner and in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and 
(e) a dedication to the representation of the best interests of all our stockholders, including our founding members. 
[END TABLE]
Diversity of Directors. In considering whether to recommend any candidate for inclusion in the slate of director nominees, our Nominating and Governance Committee complies with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In addition to considering the qualifications listed above, the Committee seeks  nominees that will complement the existing members and provide diversity of background, professional expertise, gender and ethnicity. Our Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews and assesses its evaluation process for considering nominee directors.

[END TABLE]
Elements of 2018 Compensation Program. Our Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation policies and procedures are aligned with the short-term and long-term interests of our stockholders and are designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain superior talent who are critical to our long-term growth and profitability. The 2018 Compensation Program consists of the following pay elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Salary+   Annual Cash Incentive+   Performance- Based Restricted Stock (PBRS)+   Time-Based Restricted Stock (TBRS)=   Total Direct Compensation 
Base Salary+   Annual Cash Incentive+   Performance- Based Restricted Stock (PBRS)+   Time-Based Restricted Stock (TBRS)=   Total Direct Compensation 
[END TABLE]
• Meaningful stock ownership guidelines for executives;
• No tax gross-ups on severance agreements or change in control-related payments;
• A cap on maximum annual performance incentives; 
• No special or supplemental pension or death benefits for our NEOs; and
• Adoption of anti-pledging, anti-hedging, and clawback policies. 
Pay Mix. We believe the mix of annual and long-term incentives and the mix of cash and equity awards are balanced, emphasize Company performance and do not motivate imprudent risk-taking. The following charts present the elements of compensation as a percentage of total target direct compensation for fiscal year 2018, computed using the annual salary, target annual cash incentive (assuming 100% achievement) and grant date fair value of Performance-Based Restricted Stock ("PBRS") and Time-Based Restricted Stock ("TBRS"). The first chart presents the compensation elements for our former CEO, Andrew J. England, until his separation from service and a prorated portion of our interim CEO and President, Clifford E. Marks's compensation for the remainder of 2018. The NEOs included in the second chart are Mr. Felenstein, Mses. Scherping and Hilty, and a prorated portion of Mr. Marks's compensation prior to Mr. England's separation from service. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Mix
Chief Executive Officer (a)
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Approximately 62% of Messrs. England and Marks's combined compensation is performance-based and approximately 74% of their compensation is variable, which represents the performance-based elements and time-based restricted stock. 
[END TABLE]
 Other NEOs (b)
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Approximately 47% of all other NEOs' compensation is performance-based and approximately 64% of their compensation is variable, which represents the performance-based elements and time-based restricted stock. 
[END TABLE]
Pay-for-Performance Alignment. Our Compensation Committee believes that having a large percentage of executive officers' pay as performance-based compensation ensures that their interests are aligned with those of our stockholders. Consistent with our compensation program design, our compensation program results for the 2018 fiscal year were aligned with the Company's financial results. The fiscal year 2018 annual cash incentives paid out below target (92.1%) as described in greater detail in "Fiscal 2018 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Payments." PBRS paid out below target (27.7%) for the 2016-2018 performance period, as described in greater detail in "Long-Term Incentives."
CEO Transition Plan. Andrew J. England stepped down as CEO effective November 2, 2018. Effective November 5, 2018 the Board appointed Clifford E. Marks to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer, in addition to his previous role of Company President.  His duties were expanded from leading the Company's sales and marketing departments, advertising operations, and certain other functions to now overseeing the whole Company as Interim CEO. Mr. Marks did not receive any additional compensation upon assuming the role of Interim CEO as his existing compensation was commensurate with his extensive leadership role and value to the Company as a sales visionary and customer relationship manager. Mr. Marks has an unparalleled amount of experience with the Company where he has served as a member of its leadership team since 2002. Our Board has commenced a search to identify a permanent CEO and has retained a leading executive search firm to assist in the process. It is anticipated that Mr. Marks will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer until the election by the Board of a permanent CEO. 
Detailed Discussion & Analysis
Compensation Philosophy
The primary goals of our Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review the competitiveness of executive cash compensation and equity grant levels compared to a select peer group of companies, using the 50th percentile as a reference point for setting compensation; 
• provide shorter-term cash incentives primarily for achieving specified annual performance objectives; 
• provide a mix of long-term equity incentives that are performance- and time-based to promote stock price growth, retention and ownership through achievement of long-term financial performance goals; and 
• establish and monitor appropriate pay and performance relationships. 
[END TABLE]
To achieve these goals, we intend to maintain a compensation structure that provides rewards for high performance and value creation for our stockholders (including the founding members).
Role of Compensation Consultant and CEO in Determining Executive Compensation
In 2018, our former CEO had substantial input in the determination of executive compensation other than his own and made recommendations for the compensation of all of the other NEOs that were ultimately approved by our Compensation Committee in January of 2018. Our former CEO's compensation was determined and approved by our Compensation Committee. Our former CEO was not present during voting or deliberations by our Compensation Committee regarding his compensation.
In 2018, our Compensation Committee engaged ClearBridge, a nationally recognized consulting firm, to serve as an independent consultant on executive compensation matters. ClearBridge assessed the competitiveness of pay for the executive officers and provided independent advice and recommendations to our Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation. Our Compensation Committee determined that ClearBridge is independent from the Company.
As part of its review, ClearBridge considered base salary, annual cash incentive, total cash compensation (combined salary and annual cash incentive), long-term incentives, and total direct compensation. ClearBridge reviewed and recommended a peer group for pay comparison for our executive officers comprised of companies that are publicly and domestically traded, of comparable size to NCM, Inc., and in relevant industries (i.e., in advertising, media and entertainment industries, or software technology-based companies in media-related industries). Our Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the peer group.
Our Compensation Committee believes that peer group comparisons are useful to measure the competitiveness of our compensation practices and uses the information provided by the compensation consultant as an input to its decision making. Although our Compensation Committee references the 50th percentile of the peer group's pay levels, specific positioning for each NEO is determined on a case-by-case basis considering multiple factors.
The following peer companies were used in our competitive analysis for fiscal 2018 decisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Cumulus Media Inc.    MSG Networks Inc. 
Entercom Communications Corp   The E.W. Scripps Company 
Entravision Communications Corporation   TiVo Corporation 
Emmis Communications Corporation   Townsquare Media, Inc. 
Global Eagle Entertainment Inc.   Urban One, Inc. (formerly Radio One) 
Gray Television, Inc.   Salem Media Group, Inc. 
IMAX Corp.   WebMD Health Corp. 
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated   World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
We eliminated three companies and added two from our 2017 peer group as a result of our Compensation Committee's assessment of the group relative to industry and size criteria.

Base salaries are reviewed annually by our Compensation Committee and our Board, and may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to such review and/or in accordance with guidelines contained in the various employment agreements.
The base salaries of our NEOs in 2018 compared to 2017 as of the end of the fiscal year were as follows.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name   2017 Base Salary   2018 Base Salary   Percentage Change   
Clifford E. Marks   $ 858,330     $ 875,497     2.0%   
Andrew J. England   $ 875,000     $ 875,000     —% (1) 
Katherine L. Scherping   $ 408,000     $ 408,000     —%   
Scott D. Felenstein   $ 500,000     $ 506,667     1.3%   
Sarah Kinnick Hilty   N/A     $ 310,000     N/A   (2) 
Ralph E. Hardy   $ 310,271     $ 310,271     —% (1) 
[END TABLE]
(1)    Messrs. England and Hardy's 2018 salaries represent their salary prior to the termination of their employment.
(2)     Ms. Hilty was hired in 2018, and as such did not have a 2017 base salary.
For 2018, we believe the above salaries were within a market competitive range compared to our competitors.
Annual Cash Incentive. Annual cash incentives are intended to compensate executives for achieving financial goals that support our annual operational and strategic goals. 
The target percentages for our NEOs were established based on the responsibility, experience and seniority of the individual. We believe our annual cash incentives, in combination with base salaries, deliver competitive total cash  compensation. In addition, we believe rewarding our executives for achievement of our financial goals is consistent with the practice of aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. Payments of annual cash incentives are objectively calculated for each NEO based on the achievement of specific financial targets. The process for setting the financial targets for 2018 was consistent with previous years as part of the annual budget review and approval. For 2018, the annual cash incentive was based (i) 50% on achievement of Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes and (ii) 50% on Adjusted Advertising Revenue targets. The stretch bonus for achievement above 100% of the target bonus was also based on the equal weighting of the achievement of the aforementioned targets. For Fiscal 2018, no stretch bonuses were paid as 100% of the target was not achieved for the year. These performance measures are non-GAAP measures and are specifically defined in the "Definitions of Performance Measures Used in Incentive Plans for Fiscal 2018" section below.
Our annual cash incentive is paid in a single payment in the first quarter following the completion of a given fiscal year. Payments are subject to review, approval and certification by our Compensation Committee in conjunction with the issuance of our annual audit report.
The annual cash incentive potential which is based equally on Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes (defined in the "Definitions of Performance Measures Used in Incentive Plans for Fiscal 2018" below) and Adjusted Advertising Revenue (defined in "Definitions of Performance Measures Used in Incentive Plans for Fiscal 2018" below) is achieved as follows. Straight line interpolation is applied to performance between the levels shown.

(3) Pursuant to Ms. Hilty's employment agreement, her annual cash incentive payment was to be paid in full, and prorated for her time of employment during the year. 
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentives (LTI). We believe that creating long-term value for our stockholders is achieved, in part, by aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. We have granted awards under our stockholder approved equity incentive plans, the National CineMedia, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan as amended and restated and the National CineMedia, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which together we refer to as the "Equity Incentive Plan." Stockholders approved the National CineMedia, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan in May 2016 because the National CineMedia, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan was set to expire, and has expired, by its terms in February 2017.
All grants under the Equity Incentive Plan to our executive officers are approved by our Compensation Committee generally at its first meeting of the fiscal year, although grants could be made at any time at the discretion of our Compensation Committee, generally related to promotions or other merit-related reasons.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee decided to continue to grant the following LTI vehicles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PBRS: Aligns executives with the long-term financial goals of the Company. PBRS vest based upon the achievement of cumulative 2018-2020 "Free Cash Flow", as defined within the '"Definitions of Performance Measures Used in Incentive Plans for Fiscal 2018" and 2020 "Digital Revenue" goals, as defined below.

Stockholder Say-on-Pay Vote
In establishing and recommending 2019 compensation for the Company's NEOs, our Compensation Committee considered the results of the say-on-pay vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At that meeting, our stockholders approved our executive compensation for the 2018 fiscal year with approximately 98% of the votes cast in favor. Our Board of Directors recognizes that executive compensation is an important matter of stockholder concern and takes stockholder views into account through the say-on-pay vote when reviewing the compensation program throughout the year. Our Compensation Committee considered the results of the advisory approval and as such, generally maintained the overall composition of executive compensation for the 2019 fiscal year.
Other Compensation. Our employees, including our NEOs, participate in various employee benefits. These benefits include the following: medical and dental insurance; flexible spending accounts for healthcare; life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance; employee assistance programs (confidential counseling); a 401(k) plan; and paid time off.
None of our NEOs participate in or have account balances in qualified or non-qualified defined benefit plans sponsored by us or in non-qualified defined contribution plans or other deferred compensation plans maintained by us. Our Compensation Committee may elect to provide our officers and other employees with non-qualified defined contribution or deferred compensation benefits if our Compensation Committee determines that doing so is in our best interests.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. Upon certain types of terminations of employment, payments may be made to our executive officers in accordance with their respective employment agreements. These events and potential amounts are further described below under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
Definitions of Performance Measures Used in Incentive Plans for Fiscal 2018. Presented below are definitions of performance measures used in incentive plans. Our Compensation Committee may apply pre-determined adjustments to the definitions of the financial performance criteria under the plans. 
Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes
Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes used to measure achievement against performance bonus targets is a non-GAAP financial measure that differs from Adjusted OIBDA as defined in our Form 10-K. Adjusted OIBDA is a key metric used by management to measure the Company's operating performance. OIBDA represents operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes subtracts out the revenue from advertising by NCM LLC's founding members' beverage supplier and barter revenue, net of barter expense, and adds back share-based compensation costs, CEO transition costs, fees incurred related to the negotiation of the settlement agreement with a large stockholder and the change in the make-good liability during 2018. The addition of the adjustment related to the negotiation of the settlement agreement was approved by the Compensation Committee in October 2018. While Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes is a measure used to calculate our Executive Performance Bonus awards, this non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance as determined in  accordance with GAAP, such as operating income. Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. Because other companies may calculate Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes differently than we do, this measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles operating income to Adjusted OIBDA for Compensation Purposes (dollars in millions).

Other Policies
Adoption of Share Ownership Guidelines
The Company adopted the following share ownership guidelines for its executive officers and directors in January 2013:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position    Minimum Share Ownership Level 
Chief Executive Officer and Director    Lesser of three times base salary or 140,000 shares 
President and Executive Vice Presidents    Lesser of base salary or 20,000 shares 
Non-Employee Directors    Lesser of three times annual Board cash retainer or 8,000 shares 
[END TABLE]
Each individual is expected to attain the minimum ownership level within five years of the effective date of the policy, or the individual's date of appointment, if later. If the minimum ownership level is not attained within the required timeframe, holding restrictions will apply. Upon vesting of equity awards, 50% of the individual's shares that become vested will be subject to holding restrictions until the minimum ownership level is attained. Ownership levels are determined based on Company common stock owned by each individual, including shares of unvested timed-based restricted stock and in-the-money vested stock options. As of March 4, 2019, all executive officers and directors meeting the tenure requirement were in compliance with the share ownership guidelines.
Anti-Hedging Policy
The Company's insider trading policy includes provisions that prohibit all employees and directors from entering into hedging transactions with respect to Company stock.
Anti-Pledging Policy
The Company's insider trading policy includes provisions that prohibit all employees and directors from keeping Company stock in a margin account or using Company stock as collateral for a loan. To our knowledge, none of our officers or directors has pledged any of his or her shares in violation of Company policy.
Clawback Policy
We have adopted a "clawback" policy addressing the adjustment or recovery of awards or payments if the relevant performance measures upon which they are based are restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of an award or payment. This policy, also known as a "clawback" policy, applies to all of our executive officers, including the NEOs. Under the policy, we may recover any incentive compensation paid to an executive officer of the Company in the event of a material negative accounting restatement of our financial statements due to material noncompliance by the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. If our Board of Directors determines that any current or former executive officer has engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct that caused the error that, directly or indirectly, resulted in the  financial restatement, our Board of Directors may require reimbursement or forfeiture of any annual or long-term cash bonus or any equity compensation award earned with respect to the period covered by the restatement by such executive officer.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" included elsewhere in this report with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include such disclosure for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2018 in NCM, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K and proxy statement filed with the SEC.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following summaries set forth potential payments payable to our NEOs upon termination of their employment or a change in control of NCM, Inc. under their employment agreements, as amended, and under the Equity Incentive Plan. The following discussion is based on the assumption that the actual bonus amount would be the target amount reported as a non-equity incentive plan award in the Grants of Plan Based Awards table. Actual payments may be more or less than the amounts described below. In addition, the Company may enter into new arrangements or modify these arrangements, from time to time. Each employment agreement provides definitions for the termination reasons. Descriptions of the separation arrangements for Messrs. England and Hardy are discussed below under "Employment Agreements."
The following table assumes the executive's employment was terminated under each of these circumstances on December 27, 2018 and such payments and benefits have an estimated value of:

CEO PAY RATIO The CEO's 2018 total annual compensation of $3,138,769 is approximately 36 times the median employee's 2018 total annual compensation of $87,100. The CEO's 2018 total annual compensation was based on Mr. England's 2018 compensation through the date of his separation from service, excluding his severance payment, and Mr. Marks's 2018 compensation prorated for the remainder of the year. In accordance with the SEC's disclosure rules, we utilized a median employee identified from our 2017 analysis in our 2018 compensation ratio calculation. We do not believe there were any changes in our employee population or compensation arrangements in 2018 that would significantly impact our compensation ratio disclosure. The median employee was selected utilizing 2017 taxable wages excluding the CEO, and the total annual compensation for this employee was calculated using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table, utilizing data as of December 27, 2018. The analysis included employees who were employed by NCM LLC as of December 28, 2017, full-time and part-time workers. Compensation information for employees hired during 2017 was annualized and included within the median employee analysis.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2:
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required under Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, stockholders are being asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's executive compensation, also known as "say-on-pay." We currently hold this vote annually. This non-binding advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation considers the information in this proxy statement included in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and in the Summary Compensation Table and other related tables and narrative disclosures.
Our Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation policies and procedures are aligned with the short and long-term interests of stockholders and are designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain superior talent who are critical to our long-term growth and profitability. A significant portion of the compensation of our NEOs is tied closely to the financial performance of the Company (in 2018 approximately 53% of total compensation, assuming 100% achievement of targets, and approximately 52% of total compensation, based upon actual 2018 performance bonuses paid), thus aligning our officers' interests with those of our stockholders, including the annual performance bonus and equity incentives (refer to "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Pay-for-Performance Alignment"). Under these programs, we provide our executives with incentives to achieve specific annual and long-term company performance goals established by our Compensation Committee. Our Compensation Committee reviews our executive compensation programs annually to ensure they align executive compensation with the interests of our stockholders and current market practices and do not encourage excessive risk-taking.
Because your approval is advisory, it will not be binding on either our Board of Directors or the Company. However, our Compensation Committee and Board value the opinions of our stockholders and will take into account the result of the vote on this proposal when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
Our stockholders have the opportunity to vote, on an advisory basis, for the following resolution at our Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion in this proxy statement is hereby APPROVED."
Vote Required
Approval of the foregoing resolution by our stockholders, on an advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this Proposal No. 2.
Recommendation
Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR Proposal 2, and approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's executive compensation program, as presented in this proxy statement. PROPOSAL NO. 3:
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
A resolution will be presented at the Annual Meeting to ratify the appointment by our Audit Committee of the firm Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent auditors to audit our financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year ending December 26, 2019 and to perform other approved accounting services.
Ratification by our stockholders of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors is not required by applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or otherwise. However, our Board of Directors considers the selection of our independent auditors to be an important matter of stockholder concern and is submitting the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP for ratification by stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors, our Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. Even if the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at our Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they wish to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Fees Paid to Independent Auditors
We paid Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the following amounts:

[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
All auditing services, internal control-related services, and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Company by our independent auditors must be approved by our Audit Committee in advance, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(l)(B) of the Exchange Act that are approved by our Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit. Our Audit Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more of its members or may delegate authority to one or more members, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that all decisions to grant pre-approvals pursuant to such delegated authority will be presented to the entire Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Effective with the completion of our initial public offering in February 2007, all of our independent auditors' services were pre-approved by our Audit Committee.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this proposal is required to approve Proposal No. 3.
Recommendation
Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR Proposal No. 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The charter of our Audit Committee specifies that the purpose of the Committee is to assist our Board in the oversight of management's processes and activities relating to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maintaining the reliability and integrity of our accounting policies, financial reporting practices and financial statements; 
• the independent auditor's qualifications and independence; 
• the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditor; and 
• confirming compliance with laws and regulations, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system on which our securities may be listed. 
[END TABLE]
As part of fulfilling its responsibilities, our Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of NCM, Inc. for fiscal year ended December 27, 2018 with management and discussed those matters required by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees" issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), as well as all other matters required to be discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Deloitte & Touche LLP's communications with our Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed that firm's independence with representatives of the firm with respect to NCM, Inc.
Based upon our Audit Committee's review of the audited consolidated financial statements and its discussions with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP, our Audit Committee recommended that our Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2018 in NCM, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

 VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS
Beneficial Ownership
Beneficial ownership is determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power over securities. Except in cases where community property laws apply or as indicated in the footnotes to this table, we believe that each stockholder identified in the table possesses sole voting and investment power over all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by the stockholder. As of March 4, 2019, the percentage of beneficial ownership for NCM, Inc. is based on 78,960,633 shares of common stock outstanding (including unvested restricted stock). Unless indicated below, the address of each individual listed below is 6300 South Syracuse Way, Suite 300, Centennial, Colorado 80111. The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 4, 2019, by:

Share Ownership, Anti-Hedging, Anti-Pledging and Clawback Policies
We have adopted share ownership guidelines, an anti-hedging policy, an anti-pledging policy and a clawback policy, which are discussed in further detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
General
Before the completion of our initial public offering ("IPO") in February 2007, NCM LLC was wholly owned by the founding members. After the IPO, NCM LLC was owned by us and the founding members. In connection with the IPO, we entered into several agreements to define and regulate the relationships among us, NCM LLC and the founding members. As of December 27, 2018, NCM, Inc. owned approximately 48.8% of the outstanding common membership units in NCM LLC, and Regal and Cinemark collectively owned approximately 51.2% of the outstanding common membership units in NCM LLC. NCM, Inc. is the sole managing member of NCM LLC.
Further transactions between NCM, Inc. and our founding members, if any, have been and will continue to be approved by our Audit Committee, which is composed of independent members of our Board of Directors, or another committee comprised entirely of independent members of our Board. Our Audit Committee charter authorizes our Audit Committee to hire financial advisors and other professionals to assist the committee in evaluating and approving any transaction between us and any related party, including our founding members.
On July 5, 2018, AMC sold 100.0% of its remaining NCM LLC membership units to Regal and Cinemark. Following the sale, AMC remains a party to the Exhibitor Services Agreement ("ESA"), Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, Tax  Receivable Agreement ("TRA") and certain other original agreements which are discussed further below. As such, AMC will continue to participate in the annual common unit adjustment, receive TRA payments, receive theater access fee payments, and make payments under the beverage concessionaire agreements, among other things. AMC is not currently a member under the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement and will not receive available cash distributions or allocation of earnings and losses in NCM LLC, unless it receives NCM LLC membership units pursuant to a common unit adjustment. Further, the sale does not impact future integration payments and other encumbered theater payments owed to NCM LLC by AMC. AMC is considered a related party to the Company through the divestiture date (July 5, 2018) and related party transactions with AMC through this period are included within the disclosures below.
Transactions with Founding Members
Exhibitor Services Agreements
In connection with the IPO, NCM LLC and each of AMC, Cinemark and Regal executed an amended and restated ESA, effective as of February 13, 2007, which replaced the exhibitor services agreements previously in effect. In connection with the sale of the Fathom Events business, on December 26, 2013, NCM LLC and each of AMC, Cinemark and Regal amended and restated the ESAs to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to the digital programming services of the Fathom Events business. Certain basic terms of the ESAs are discussed below:
Advertising Services. Under the ESAs, NCM LLC is the exclusive provider within the United States of advertising services in the founding members' theaters (subject to pre-existing contractual obligations and other limited exceptions for the benefit of the founding members). The ESAs have a term of 30 years from the completion of the IPO, with a five-year right of first refusal to enter into a services agreement for the services provided under the ESA with the applicable founding member on terms equivalent to those offered by a third-party.
The advertising services include the on-screen advertising of the Noovie pre-show, use of the lobby entertainment network or LEN and lobby promotions. The pre-show is generally 20 to 30 minutes long. The Noovie pre-show includes up to two minutes for the founding members to be used to promote various activities associated with operation of the theaters, including concessions, ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, founding member special events and vendors of non-film related services provided to theaters, only if the promotion is incidental to the vendor's service (called theater advertising). Under the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of the Noovie program can be sold to NCM LLC's founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements. During 2018, we sold 60 seconds to two of NCM LLC's founding members and 30 seconds to one of NCM LLC's founding members. Per the ESA, the annual cost per thousand ("CPM") change equals the prior year annual percentage change in the advertising CPM charged by NCM LLC to unaffiliated third parties during the last few minutes of the Noovie pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC.
In the lobby, the founding members are required to provide a specified number of LEN screens according to the number of auditoriums in the theater. The founding members have the right to install additional screens in their theater lobbies, but these screens can only be used for limited strategic programs, described below, concessions and theater advertising. NCM LLC's founding members may conduct a limited number of lobby promotions at no charge in connection with the promotion of motion pictures and their strategic programs; however, such activities do not reduce the lobby promotions inventory available to us.
Payments. In consideration for access to the founding members' theater attendees for on-screen advertising and use of the founding members' theaters for the LEN and lobby promotions, the founding members receive a monthly theater access fee. The theater access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for any advertising exhibited by some, but not all, theaters or founding members because of content objections or technical capacity. The theater access fee paid to founding members included an additional fee for digital cinema systems connected to our advertising network. The payment per theater patron increases by 8% every five years with the next such increase occurring in 2022. The payment per digital screen and for the digital cinema systems increases annually by 5%. In 2018, the theater access fee aggregate payments to related parties totaled $69.0 million. Also, in 2018, total revenue from related parties related to beverage concessionaire agreements totaled $28.4 million.
Net Payments to Related Parties. In 2018, the net payments to each related party for theater access fees and payments for use of their screens, less the purchase from NCM LLC of advertising under the founding member's beverage concessionaire agreements were $18.4 million to Regal, $12.1 million to Cinemark and $9.0 million to AMC, respectively. As discussed above, the amount for AMC includes activity through July 5, 2018. As of December 27, 2018, amounts due to Regal and Cinemark were $15.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively. These amounts are net of integration payments due from the founding members. Refer to the 'Common Unit Adjustment Agreement' section for further discussion of the nature and magnitude of these payments in 2018. NCM LLC Operating Agreement
NCM, Inc., AMC, Cinemark and Regal executed the NCM LLC third amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement, effective as of February 13, 2007, which was amended on March 16, 2009 (to permit NCM LLC to provide advertising to a variety of out-of-home advertising venues), on August 6, 2010 and September 3, 2013 (in each case, to modify the timing of written notice should a founding member desire to exercise its option to redeem common membership units), and on January 23, 2019 (to update the member's rights following changes within the tax partnership rules). Certain basic terms of the restated operating agreement are as follows.
Manager of NCM LLC. NCM, Inc. is a member and the sole manager of NCM LLC. As the sole manager, NCM, Inc. controls all of the day to day business affairs and decision-making of NCM LLC through our officers and directors without the approval of any other member. Furthermore, we cannot be removed as manager of NCM LLC. As long as we are the manager of NCM LLC, unless the founding members approve, our business will be limited to owning and managing the common units, managing the business of NCM LLC, fulfilling our obligations under the Exchange Act, and activities incidental to the foregoing. We are not entitled to compensation for our services as manager except as provided in the Management Services Agreement described under "– Transactions with NCM LLC – Management Services Agreement" below or as otherwise approved by the members under the restated operating agreement.
Issuance of Units upon Exercise or Vesting of Equity Compensation. Upon the exercise of options we have issued or the vesting of shares for other types of equity compensation, we will have the right to acquire from NCM LLC a number of common units equal to the number of our shares being issued in connection with the exercise of options or vesting of shares for other types of equity compensation. In consideration for such units, we will contribute to NCM LLC the consideration we received for the exercise of options or vesting of shares for other types of equity compensation. In 2018, we acquired 734,176 units due to vesting of restricted stock.
Founding Member Approval Rights. If any director designee to our Board of Directors designated by NCM LLC's other members, Regal and Cinemark, under the Director Designation Agreement, described below, is not appointed to our Board, nominated by us or elected by our stockholders, as applicable, then each of the other members (so long as such other member continues to own 5% of NCM LLC's issued and outstanding common membership units) will be entitled to approve certain actions of NCM LLC as identified in the restated operating agreement. As discussed above, AMC is not currently a member under the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement and no longer has the aforementioned approval rights. 
Distributions. We are required to make mandatory distributions to members of all "Available Cash," as defined in the restated operating agreement. Available Cash does not include amounts drawn or paid under NCM LLC's working capital line of credit. The mandatory distributions must occur quarterly. In 2018, available cash distributions totaled $141.4 million. Of that amount, the portion payable to NCM, Inc., Regal, Cinemark and AMC totaled $69.1 million, $35.8 million, $34.3 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. The amount for the distribution payable to AMC represents only the distribution for the three months ended March 29, 2018 to AMC. AMC's distribution for the three months ended June 28, 2018 was paid to Cinemark and Regal to accommodate agreements between AMC and each of Cinemark and Regal. Further, there was no distribution to AMC for the three months ended September 27, 2018 and December 27, 2018 as they had no ownership in these periods. 
Common Unit Redemption Right. Members have a redemption right to exchange common membership units of NCM LLC for our shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis (as adjusted for certain events), or at our option, a cash payment equal to the market price of one share of our common stock. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, upon the surrender of the NCM LLC common units, we will then contribute cash or shares of our common stock to NCM LLC in exchange for an amount of newly issued common units equal to the number of units surrendered by the redeeming member. NCM LLC will then distribute the cash or shares of common stock to the redeeming member to complete the redemption. AMC exercised the redemption right of an aggregate 200,000 common membership units in 2015 and 15,600,000 common membership units in 2017, whereby AMC surrendered 200,000 and 15,600,000 common membership units, respectively, to NCM LLC for cancellation. The Company contributed an aggregate of 200,000 and 15,600,000 shares of its common stock to NCM LLC in exchange for a like number of newly issued common membership units. NCM LLC then distributed the shares of common stock to AMC to complete the redemptions.
Common Unit Adjustment Agreement
NCM, Inc., NCM LLC, AMC, Cinemark, and Regal executed the common unit adjustment agreement, effective as of February 13, 2007. The common unit adjustment agreement provides a mechanism for adjusting membership units held by the founding members based on increases or decreases in the number of screens operated by each founding member. Increases in the number of screens are included in the unit adjustment if arising from acquisition of a theater or opening of a newly constructed theater (subject to certain exceptions). Decreases in the number of screens are included in the unit adjustment if arising from disposition of a theater (subject to certain exceptions). NCM LLC adjusts its membership units annually, except that an earlier adjustment will occur for a founding member if it acquires or disposes of theaters, in a single transaction or cumulatively that will result in a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all founding members (called an extraordinary attendance increase or decrease). The changes in annual attendance are calculated based on attendance at the relevant theaters during the prior twelve fiscal months; however, if an acquired theater has not been operating during the twelve prior fiscal months, the change in annual attendance will be calculated based on 75% of the projected annual attendance for such theater, with a subsequent adjustment for the actual attendance.
During the first quarter of 2018, NCM LLC issued 2,821,710 (3,736,860 issued, net of 915,150 returned) common membership units to its founding members for the rights to exclusive access to the theater screens and attendees added, net of dispositions by the founding members to NCM LLC's network during the 2017 fiscal year. 
If an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider is in place with respect to any acquired theaters, the founding members may elect to receive common membership units related to those encumbered theaters in connection with the common unit adjustment. If the founding members make this election, then they are required to make payments on a quarterly basis in arrears in accordance with certain run-out provisions pursuant to the ESAs ("integration payments"). Because the AMC Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike"), AMC Rave, and Cinemark Rave theaters are subject to an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider, AMC and Cinemark will make integration payments to NCM LLC. The integration payments will continue until the earlier of (i) the date the theaters are transferred to NCM LLC's network or (ii) the expiration of the ESA. Integration payments are calculated based upon the advertising cash flow that the Company would have generated if it had exclusive access to sell advertising in the theaters with pre-existing advertising agreements. The ESA additionally entitles NCM LLC to payments related to the founding members' on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements for encumbered theaters ("encumbered theater payments"). These payments are also accounted for as a reduction to the intangible asset. If common membership units are issued to a founding member for newly acquired theaters that are subject to an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider, the amortization of the intangible asset commences after the existing agreement expires and NCM LLC can utilize the theaters for all of its services. During the years ended December 27, 2018, December 28, 2017 and December 29, 2016, the Company recorded a reduction to net intangible assets of $21.4 million, $20.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to these Carmike integration and encumbered theater payments as well as those made by AMC and Cinemark for the previous acquisition of Rave Cinemas. During the years ended December 27, 2018, December 28, 2017 and December 29, 2016 AMC and Cinemark paid a total of $22.7 million, $12.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to the integration and other encumbered theater payments (as payments are made one quarter and one month in arrears, respectively).
Tax Receivable Agreement
NCM, Inc., NCM LLC, AMC, Cinemark, and Regal executed the tax receivable agreement, effective as of February 13, 2007, as amended on April 29, 2008 to permit NCM, Inc. to make estimated payments to each of the founding members or ESA parties.
The tax receivable agreement provides for the effective payment by us to the founding members of 90% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realized as a result of certain increases in our proportionate share of tax basis in NCM LLC's tangible and intangible assets resulting from our IPO and related transactions, including increases attributable to payments made under the tax receivable agreement. These tax benefit payments are not conditioned upon one or more of the founding members maintaining a continued ownership interest in either NCM LLC or NCM, Inc. We expect to benefit from the remaining 10% of cash savings, if any, that we may actually realize.
Under the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax are computed by comparing our actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no increase in our proportionate share of tax basis in NCM LLC's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into. The tax receivable agreement generally applies to our taxable years up to and including the 30th anniversary date of our IPO and will continue until any utilized benefits are no longer subject to potential audit or examination by a taxing authority. The term of the tax receivable agreement may, however, be terminated at an earlier date in the event that we exercise our right to terminate the agreement pursuant to an early termination procedure that requires us to pay the founding members an agreed upon amount equal to the present value of the estimated remaining payments to be made under the revenue sharing agreement.
Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement varies depending upon a number of factors (including the timing of any redemptions of common membership units in NCM LLC by our founding members, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable, the trading price of shares of our common stock at the time of any such redemptions, and the amount and timing of our income), we expect the payments that we may effectively  make to the founding members could be substantial. If the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority were to subsequently challenge any of our cash savings covered by the tax receivable agreement, and if such challenge were ultimately upheld, the terms of the tax receivable agreement require the founding members to repay to us an amount equal to the prior payments effectively made by us in respect of such disallowed cash savings, plus a proportionate share of any applicable interest and penalties. In such an event, and if a founding member is unable to make a timely repayment to us under the terms of the tax receivable agreement, we will have the ability to cause NCM LLC to offset against payments owed to the founding member. The repayment obligation is a several liability of each founding member and not a joint liability among the founding members.
As of December 27, 2018, we had a balance recorded for the payable to our related parties under the tax receivable agreement of approximately $152.3 million, of which the Company expects to make $11.2 million in payments during 2019 for the 2018 taxable year. In 2018, pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, we made payments of $8.4 million to Regal, $5.4 million to AMC, and $4.6 million to Cinemark for the 2017 taxable year.
Software License Agreement
NCM LLC, AMC, Cinemark, Regal CineMedia Corporation ("RCM") and Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, a company jointly owned by the founding members ("DCIP"), executed the Second Amended and Restated Software License Agreement effective as of February 13, 2007 (the "license agreement"). Certain basic terms of the license agreement are discussed below:
AMC and RCM granted to NCM LLC an exclusive license (subject to certain exceptions) to identified technology for use in the United States with respect to the services provided under the ESAs. The founding members and DCIP each granted to NCM LLC a license, subject to certain limitations, to any existing and future developments of such party based on the licensed technology that has application to the services provided under the ESAs. NCM LLC granted to the founding members a license, subject to certain limitations, to any NCM LLC developments that existed at the IPO date based on licensed technology, solely for the founding members' internal business purposes that are outside of the services that are defined in the ESAs (but not including digital cinema applications). NCM LLC granted DCIP a license, subject to certain exceptions, to any existing and future NCM LLC developments that may have digital cinema applications.
Director Designation Agreement
NCM, Inc., AMC, Cinemark and Regal executed the Director Designation Agreement effective as of February 13, 2007.  AMC no longer has rights under this agreement. 
So long as Regal or Cinemark, respectively, owns at least 5% of NCM LLC's issued and outstanding common membership units, such founding member has the right to designate two nominees to our Board of Directors who are voted upon by our stockholders. At least one of the designees of such founding member must qualify as an "independent director" at the time of designation so that a majority of the members of our Board are "independent directors" under the Nasdaq rules. We have agreed to include each director designee in our Board's slate of nominees submitted to our stockholders for election of directors and in the proxy statement prepared by management for every meeting of our stockholders called with respect to the election of members of our Board, subject to certain exceptions.
If a vacancy occurs because of the death, disability, resignation or removal of a director designee, then our Board, or any Board committee, will not vote, fill the vacancy or take any action subject to supermajority Board approval under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation until (i) the founding member has designated a successor director designee and our Board has appointed such successor director designee, (ii) the founding member fails to designate a successor director designee within 10 business days of such vacancy, or (iii) the founding member has waived its rights to designate a successor director designee and has consented to our Board, or any Board committee, taking a vote on the specified actions prior to our Board filling the vacancy with a successor director designee.
Registration Rights Agreement
NCM, Inc., AMC, Cinemark and Regal executed the registration rights agreement effective as of February 13, 2007.
The registration rights agreement requires us to use our reasonable efforts to file a registration statement on the first business day after the one-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO to register all registrable securities held by the founding members that are not already registered, if necessary, and to file resale registration statements after that time for any additional registrable securities that we issue to any founding member in the future, within 20 days after such issuance. Additionally, we must maintain effectiveness of these mandatory registration statements until the earlier of the time when the founding members have disposed of all their registrable securities and the time when all registrable securities held by the founding members are  eligible for resale under specified securities regulations. We are responsible for the expenses in connection with the registration of securities pursuant to the registration rights agreement.
Joint Defense Agreements
NCM, Inc., NCM LLC and the founding members from time to time may enter into a joint defense and common interest agreement, under which the parties agree to cooperate and share information in order to advance their shared interests in owning and operating NCM LLC.
Agreements with Founding Members—Services
In 2018, NCM LLC paid approximately $1.2 million in aggregate to AMC (through July 5, 2018), Cinemark and Regal for the purchases of movie tickets and concession products primarily for marketing to NCM LLC's advertising clients.
Other Transactions
Letter Agreement
Under the terms of the Letter Agreement, Standard General agreed to vote, until the end of the Standstill Period (defined below), (i) in favor of each director nominated and recommended by the Board for election at any meeting of the Company's stockholders, (ii) in accordance with the recommendations by the Board on certain routine proposals, including Proposal No. 3 relating to the ratification of the auditors, and (iii) against any stockholder nominees not recommended by the Board and against any proposals or resolutions to remove members of the Board. Standard General also agreed, subject to certain limitations, to refrain from certain actions during the Standstill Period, including (A) engaging in any "solicitation" or otherwise become a "participant" in any contested solicitation as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the SEC; (B) submitting any stockholder proposal or any notice of nomination or other business for consideration to the Board; (C) seeking to acquire the Company or any of its material assets, or proposing mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations involving the Company; (D) acquiring additional shares of the Company's common stock following which Standard General would economically own or have a total net long position greater than 30% of the Company's outstanding common stock; and (E) certain other actions specified in the Letter Agreement.
The term "Standstill Period" means the period of time starting on the date of the Letter Agreement and ending 30 days prior to the deadline for stockholder nominations and proposals for the Company's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but in any event no later than February 28, 2022. However, Standard General may terminate the Standstill Period if any of its designees fail to be elected to the Board and the Board does not appoint such designees to the Board within the time periods specified in the Letter Agreement. In addition, the Standstill Period will be suspended at any time when Standard General's aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock falls below 7,900,361 shares (the "Minimum Ownership Level"), and in the event that Standard General subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock that exceeds the Minimum Ownership level, the Standstill Period shall resume, including all associated obligations and restrictions.
The Company agreed to nominate two individuals designated by Standard General for election at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting occurring during the Standstill Period, subject to the designees satisfying certain criteria. At the Company's request, Standard General will cause its designees to resign from the Board if Standard General's aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock falls below the Minimum Ownership Level.
The Company agreed that the size of the Board will not exceed nine directors during the Standstill Period, subject to an increase only to appoint designees of Standard General that are not otherwise elected to the Board as set forth in the Letter Agreement. The Company further agreed that upon the request of Standard General, the Board will appoint a Standard General designee to serve as a member of any committee of the Board requested by Standard General other than the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, subject to certain limitations in the Letter Agreement. The Letter Agreement also provides that (i) that, during the standstill period the Board's Audit Committee will include at least one director who is neither a designee of Standard General nor a designee of Cinemark or Regal pursuant to the Director Designation Agreement and (ii) that, during the Standstill Period, the Board will not take any action to further amend the Company's Statement of Policy with Respect to Related Party Transactions.
Sale of Fathom Events Business to AC JV, LLC
On December 26, 2013, NCM LLC sold the Fathom Events business to AC JV, LLC owned 32% by each of the founding members and 4% by us. In consideration for the sale, NCM LLC received a total of $25.0 million in promissory notes from our founding members (one-third or approximately $8.3 million from each founding member). The notes bear interest at a  fixed rate of 5.0% per annum, compounded annually. Interest and principal payments are due annually in six equal installments commencing on December 26, 2014. Due to the related party nature of the transaction, we formed a committee of independent directors that hired a separate legal counsel and an investment banking firm who advised the committee and rendered an opinion as to the fairness of the transaction. During 2018, we received interest on the notes of approximately $0.3 million. NCM LLC's investment in AC JV, LLC was $0.9 million as of December 27, 2018. During the year ended December 27, 2018, NCM LLC received a cash distribution from AC JV, LLC of $0.2 million and recorded equity in earnings of $0.2 million for AC JV, LLC. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement and a services agreement:
Transition Services Agreement with AC JV, LLC. NCM LLC entered into a transition services agreement with AC JV, LLC upon the closing of the sale of Fathom Events. Under the agreement, NCM LLC provided certain corporate overhead services for a fee and was reimbursed for the use of facilities and certain services including creative, technical event management and event management for AC JV, LLC for a period of nine months following closing. The parties extended the transition services agreement, during which extended period NCM would continue to provide certain limited services for a fee. During the year ended December 27, 2018, we received approximately $0.2 million under this agreement.
Services Agreement with AC JV, LLC. NCM LLC entered into a services agreement with AC JV, LLC upon the closing of the sale of Fathom Events. The agreement grants AC JV, LLC advertising on-screen and on our LEN and a pre-feature program prior to Fathom events reasonably consistent with what was previously dedicated to Fathom. In addition, the services agreement provides that we will assist with event sponsorship sales in return for a share of the sponsorship revenue. NCM LLC has also agreed to provide creative and media production services for a fee. The term of the agreement coincides with the ESAs, subject to certain exceptions.
Transactions with NCM LLC
Management Services Agreement
On February 13, 2007, NCM, Inc. and NCM LLC executed the management services agreement under which we provide certain management services to NCM LLC, including services typically provided by the individuals serving in the positions of chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, and general counsel. In exchange for the services, NCM LLC reimburses us for compensation and other expenses of our officers and employees and for certain out-of-pocket costs. NCM LLC provides administrative and support services to us, such as office facilities, equipment, supplies, payroll and accounting and financial reporting. The management services agreement also provides that our employees may participate in NCM LLC's benefit plans, and that NCM LLC employees may participate in the National CineMedia, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and the National CineMedia, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. Pursuant to this agreement, NCM LLC paid us approximately $17.8 million during 2018.
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
Our written Statement of Policy with Respect to Related Party Transactions requires that transactions (i) of the type described in Section 144(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (ii) otherwise involving us and in which a related party (i.e., a director, director nominee, executive officer, greater than five percent beneficial owner of our common stock, or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest and in which the aggregate amount involved will or may exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, be approved by our Audit Committee or another committee of the Board composed solely of disinterested directors. In determining whether to approve, ratify or disapprove of the entry into a related party transaction, the reviewing committee considers all relevant material information and takes into account, among other factors, whether the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company and would apply on the same basis if the transaction did not involve a related party, and whether there are any compelling business reasons for the Company to enter into the transaction and the nature of alternative transactions, if any. Certain transactions and relationships have been determined not to constitute related party transactions for purposes of the policy, including (a) executive officer compensation approved by our Compensation Committee or Board, (b) director compensation, (c) interests arising solely from ownership of our common stock and other stockholders have the same proportional interest, (d) certain interests arising from the related party's position as a director, employee or beneficial owner of less than 10% of another company, (e) any transaction involving a related party where the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bids, and (f) any indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by our governing documents or by agreement with the related party.
CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our directors, executive officers and all of our employees. We will provide any person, without charge and upon request, with a copy of our Code of Conduct. Requests should be directed to us at 6300 South Syracuse Way, Suite 300, Centennial, Colorado 80111, Attention: Secretary. The Code of  Business Conduct and Ethics is also available on our website at www.ncm.com at the Investor Relations link. The information on our website is not incorporated into this proxy statement.
We will disclose any amendments to or waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our website at www.ncm.com. We have established a confidential hotline and website to answer employees' questions related to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and to report any concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. Our Audit Committee also has established procedures to receive, retain and treat complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential, anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of our common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. As a matter of practice, we assist many of our directors and all of our executive officers by preparing initial ownership reports and reporting ownership changes, and typically file these reports on their behalf. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied with on a timely basis during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2018, except that (i) one Form 4 for Thomas Lesinski was filed one day late on November 2, 2018, and (ii) one Form 4 for Standard General L.P. and Kim Soohyung was filed one day late on November 13, 2018.
PROPOSALS OF STOCKHOLDERS
Our bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, must provide timely notice in writing. To be timely, a stockholder's notice generally must be delivered to and received at our principal executive offices, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, that in the event that the date of such meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to, or delayed by more than 70 days after, the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of our stockholders, a stockholder's notice to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Our bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice. These provisions may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at an annual meeting of stockholders.
Stockholders wishing to include proposals in the proxy materials in relation to the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must submit the proposals in writing so as to be received by the Secretary at our executive offices, no later than the close of business on November 15, 2019. Such proposals must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the SEC relating to stockholders' proposals and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation. If we are not notified of intent to present a proposal at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders by January 29, 2020, we will have the right to exercise discretionary voting authority with respect to such proposal, if presented at the meeting, without including information regarding such proposal in our proxy materials.
OTHER BUSINESS
No other business has been properly submitted for consideration at the Annual Meeting in the manner specified under our bylaws; therefore no other matters will be brought before the Annual Meeting.
