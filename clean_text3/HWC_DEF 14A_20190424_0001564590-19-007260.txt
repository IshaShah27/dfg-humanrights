HANCOCK WHITNEY CORPORATION
PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON APRIL 24, 2019
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
You are receiving these materials because you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on February 25, 2019, the record date for the meeting, and are entitled to vote those shares at the meeting.  All materials for the 2019 annual meeting are available to you online at https://materials.proxyvote.com/410120 beginning March 12, 2019 and, in some cases, we have delivered printed proxy materials to you.  This proxy statement summarizes information you should consider in connection with your vote on the matters that will be considered at the annual meeting.  You do not need to attend the annual meeting in person to vote your shares.
Where and when is the annual meeting?
We will hold the annual meeting on Wednesday April 24, 2019, at 10:30 a.m. local time at Hancock Whitney Plaza, 2510 14th Street, Gulfport, Mississippi 39501. To obtain directions to attend the annual meeting and vote in person, please contact Investor Relations by telephone at (504) 299-5208 or toll free at (800) 347-7272, or by email at InvestorRelations@hancockwhitney.com.
Why did I receive a notice of internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?
In accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), we are permitted to furnish proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our 2018 annual report, to shareholders by providing access to these documents online instead of mailing printed copies. Most shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless requested. Instead, most shareholders will only receive a notice that provides instructions on how to access and review our proxy materials online. We have elected electronic access to our proxy materials to save the Company the cost of producing and mailing these documents. We believe this expedites shareholder receipt of proxy materials, lowers the costs incurred by us and conserves natural resources. The notice also provides instructions on how to submit your proxy and vote online or by phone.  If you would like to receive a printed copy or emailed copy of our proxy materials free of charge, please follow the instructions set forth in the notice to request the materials.
Who is soliciting my proxy?
Our Board of Directors (our Board) is soliciting a proxy to vote the shares that you are entitled to vote at our 2019 annual meeting, whether or not you attend in person.  By completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy card or voting instruction card, or submitting your proxy online or by phone with your voting instructions, you are authorizing the proxy holders to vote your shares at our annual meeting in accordance with your instructions.
Who may vote at the annual meeting?
You may vote at the annual meeting if you owned Company common stock at the close of business on February 25, 2019, the record date for the meeting. You are entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock held by you on the record date, including shares:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• held directly in your name with our transfer agent (with respect to such shares you are referred to as the "shareholder of record"); 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• held for you in an account with a broker, bank or other nominee (such shares are considered to be held in "street name"); and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• credited to your employee account in the Hancock Whitney Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan (the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan).   
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
How many shares must be present to hold the annual meeting?
A majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date must be present at the annual meeting to convene the meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. On the record date, there were 87,014,814 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Accordingly, 43,507,408 shares of our common stock constitute a quorum. If you are a street name holder and you do not instruct your broker or nominee how to vote your shares on any of the proposals, and your broker or nominee submits a proxy with respect to your shares on a matter with respect to which discretionary voting is permitted, your shares will be counted as present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. In addition, shareholders of record who are present at the annual meeting in person or by proxy will be counted as present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, whether or not such holder abstains from voting on any or all of the proposals.  
What proposals are scheduled for a vote at the annual meeting?
There are three proposals scheduled for a shareholder vote at the annual meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  To elect four directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting; 
    2.  To approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers; and 
    3.  To ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books of the Company and its subsidiaries for 2019. 
[END TABLE]
How do I vote my shares in person at the annual meeting?
If you choose to vote in person at the annual meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if you are a shareholder of record or hold shares in the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan and received printed proxy materials, you should bring your proxy card(s) and proof of your identity; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if you hold your shares in street name, you must obtain and bring with you a broker representation letter in your name from your bank, broker or other holder of record and proof of your identity; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if you are a shareholder of record and received a notice of internet availability of proxy materials in lieu of printed materials, you should bring the notice and proof of your identity.

At the appropriate time during the annual meeting, we will ask the shareholders present to turn in all notices, voting instruction cards and proxy cards if they have not done so at registration.
Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we encourage you to submit your voting instructions and proxy online, by phone or by mail (as described below) so your shares will be counted as present and voted if you later decide not to attend in person.
How do I vote my shares without attending the annual meeting?
Whether you hold shares in your own name, in street name or through the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan, you may vote your shares without attending the annual meeting.  
Shareholders of Record and Shareholders through the Hancock Whitney 401(k) Plan:  You may submit a proxy to vote your shares in any of the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Online – You may submit your proxy and voting instructions online by following the instructions on the notice or proxy card prior to the deadline for online submissions.  If you submit your proxy and voting instructions online, you do not need to return a proxy card. The online submission procedures will authenticate your identity as a shareholder, allow you to give your voting instructions and submit your proxy and confirm that your instructions have been properly received. The deadline for online submissions is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (10:59 p.m. Central Time) on April 23, 2019.   
• By Phone – You may submit your proxy and voting instructions by using any touch-tone telephone and following the instructions on the notice or proxy card prior to the deadline for telephone submissions.  If you

     submit your proxy and voting instructions by telephone, you do not need to return a proxy card. The telephone submission procedures will authenticate your identity as a shareholder, allow you to give your voting instructions and submit your proxy and confirm that your instructions have been properly received. The deadline for phone submissions is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (10:59 p.m. Central Time) on April 23, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail – If you received or requested printed materials, you may submit your proxy and voting instructions by mail by completing, signing, dating, and returning your proxy card in the postage prepaid envelope provided. You should sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example as guardian, executor, trustee, custodian, attorney, or officer of a corporation), you should indicate your name and your title or capacity. The Corporate Secretary must receive your proxy card by 9:00 a.m. Central Time on April 24, 2019 in order for your shares to be voted. 
[END TABLE]
Street Name Shareholders:  For shares held in street name, you should follow the voting directions provided by your broker or nominee. You may complete and mail a voting instruction card to your broker or nominee or, if permitted by your broker or nominee, submit voting instructions online.  If you provide specific voting instructions, your broker or nominee will vote your shares as you direct.
What happens if I submit a proxy without complete instructions or if I do not vote at all? On which proposals may my shares be voted without receiving voting instructions from me?
If you properly complete, sign, date, and return a proxy or voting instruction card, or submit your proxy online, your stock will be voted as you specify.  
If you do not submit a proxy or voting instruction card, or if you submit a properly executed proxy with incomplete voting instructions, whether your shares may be voted depends upon two factors – whether you are a shareholder of record or a street name shareholder and, if you are a street name shareholder, whether the proposal is considered routine or non-routine under New York Stock Exchange rules that apply to securities intermediaries (such as brokers, banks, and other nominees).  
Shareholders of Record and Shareholders through the Hancock Whitney 401(k) Plan:  If you do not provide voting instructions on any matter (either by not returning a proxy card or not voting online or due to incomplete voting instructions) and you do not vote in person by attending the meeting, your shares will not be voted on the matter for which instructions are not received. If you do not submit a proxy at all and do not vote in person at the annual meeting, your shares will not be voted on any matter.  However, if you submit a properly executed proxy card but do not provide voting instructions, your proxy will vote as recommended by the Board of Directors, which will be as follows at the 2019 Annual Meeting:  FOR all four nominees under Proposal 1, FOR Proposal 2, FOR Proposal 3, and as the proxies decide on any matter properly brought before the meeting. 
Street Name Shareholders:  If you hold shares in street name and you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee, your broker, bank, or other nominee only has discretionary authority to vote your shares on routine matters.  The proposal to ratify the Board's selection of the independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter; however, the proposal to elect directors and the say-on-pay proposal are each considered non-routine matters. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions on the proposal to elect directors and the say-on-pay proposal, your shares will not be voted on those proposals.
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for you in street name submits a proxy that votes your shares on one or more matters, but does not vote (the broker non-vote) on non-routine matters with respect to which you have not given voting instructions.
What are my voting options for each proposal?  How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?  How many votes are required to approve each proposal?  How are the votes counted?
The following chart explains what your voting options are with regard to each matter proposed in this proxy statement, how the Board of Directors recommends that you vote on each proposal, what vote is required for each proposal to be approved, and how abstentions, withheld votes, and broker non-votes will affect the outcome of each proposal.

What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
If you receive more than one notice, proxy card or voting instruction card, it means you hold shares registered in more than one name, or through multiple street name accounts.  To ensure that all of your shares are represented at the meeting and voted, complete, sign, date and return each proxy card or voting instruction card, or if you submit your proxy and voting instructions online or by phone, do so for each notice, proxy card and voting instruction card you receive.  If you plan to vote in person at the annual meeting, please bring all notices, proxy cards and voting instruction cards with you in addition to any other required items listed under "How do I vote my shares in person at the annual meeting?" 
May I change my vote?
Yes.  Your proxy may be revoked or changed at any time before it is voted by providing notice of revocation in writing to our Corporate Secretary, by our timely receipt of another proxy with a later date, by a later-dated online vote, or by voting in person at the annual meeting. Written notice should be provided to Joy Lambert Phillips, our Corporate Secretary, at or before the annual meeting.  Ms. Phillips' office is located in Hancock Whitney Plaza, 2510 14th Street, Suite 610, Gulfport, Mississippi 39501. The notice must be received prior to the exercise of the proxy.  Your attendance alone at the annual meeting will not be enough to revoke your proxy.
If you hold shares in street name, you must follow your broker's instructions to change your vote.
Who pays for soliciting proxies?
The Company pays all costs of soliciting proxies.  In addition, directors, officers and regular employees of the Company and its banking subsidiary, Hancock Whitney Bank (the Bank), may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, email or personal interview, but will not receive additional compensation for such solicitations.  
Could other matters be considered and voted upon at the annual meeting?
Our Board does not expect to bring any other matter before the annual meeting, and it is not aware of any other matter that may be considered at the annual meeting.  In addition, pursuant to our Bylaws, the deadline has expired for any shareholder to properly bring a matter before the annual meeting.  However, if any other matter does properly come before the annual meeting, each of the proxy holders will vote in his discretion on such matter. Table of Contents
What happens if the annual meeting is postponed or adjourned?
Unless a new record date is fixed, your proxy will still be valid and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned annual meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is used to vote your shares of our common stock.

PROPOSAL NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Articles of Incorporation require the Company to have a Board of at least nine directors, with no maximum limit on the number of directors, divided into three classes. As of the record date, we had 15 directors.  By Board resolution, the Board size will be reduced to 13 directors effective as of the date of the annual meeting, as two directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting (Messrs. Estabrook and Nickelsen) are not eligible to stand for re-election per our Corporate Governance Guidelines and will retire. 
Four directors are nominated for re-election at the annual meeting. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the Corporate Governance Committee) met in February 2019 to evaluate the nominees standing for election. Based on the Corporate Governance Committee's evaluation and unanimous recommendation, the Board has nominated the following four persons for re-election as directors for a three-year term expiring at the Company's 2022 annual meeting:  (1) Hardy B. Fowler, (2) Randall W. Hanna, (3) Sonya C. Little, and (4) Robert W. Roseberry.  Each of these individuals is currently serving as a director of our Company.   
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" all four nominees.  In the unexpected event that, prior to the date of the annual meeting, any such nominee becomes unwilling or unable to serve, it is intended that the proxy holders will vote for the election of any replacement nominee recommended by the Board.
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, which means that the four director nominees who receive the highest number of shares voted "for" their election are elected to the Board. In 2013, our Board adopted a director resignation policy.  The policy provides that if a director standing for election receives a greater number of "withheld" votes than "for" votes, the director will promptly tender his or her resignation.  The Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation and otherwise address any noted shareholder concerns. The Board will act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days of the annual meeting, and the Company will disclose the Board's decision and any other material information on a current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.
Nominations for election to the Board may be made as set forth under the heading "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance – Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee" on page 20 of this proxy statement.
INFORMATION ABOUT DIRECTORS
The following sets forth information we have obtained from the director nominees and continuing directors regarding:  (a) their principal occupations for the last five years; (b) directorships they hold or have held within the last five years with other public companies; (c) their ages at February 25, 2019; (d) the year they were first elected as a director; and (e) a description of positions and offices they hold with the Company or the Bank (other than as a director), as applicable. The below also sets forth the director's particular experience, qualifications, attributes, or  Table of Contents skills that, when considered in the aggregate, led the Board to conclude that the person should serve as a director of the Company. 
Unless otherwise specified, references herein to "the merger" shall mean the merger between the Company and Whitney Holding Corporation on June 4, 2011. As part of our plan to consolidate our two iconic brands last year, the name of the Bank was changed to Hancock Whitney Bank and the name of the Company was changed to Hancock Whitney Corporation.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors to file initial reports of ownership of the Company's common stock, as well as reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely on a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5, any amendments to those Forms, and written representations from executive officers and directors to the Company, all required filings by such persons were timely made during 2018.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board of Directors
The Board held 9 meetings in 2018. The Board currently consists of 15 directors. In February 2019, the Board voted to reduce its size to 13 directors effective as of the annual meeting, as Messrs. Estabrook and Nickelsen, whose terms expire at the annual meeting, are not eligible to stand for re-election per our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board has the power to expand or reduce its size at any time, subject to the requirement in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws that the Company have a minimum of nine directors.  
The Board currently has one employee director. The Board has determined that all non-employee directors – Frank E. Bertucci, James B. Estabrook, Jr., Hardy B. Fowler, Randall W. Hanna, James H. Horne, Jerry L. Levens, Constantine S. Liollio, Sonya C. Little, Eric J. Nickelsen, Thomas H. Olinde, Christine L. Pickering, Robert W. Roseberry, Joan C. Teofilo, and C. Richard Wilkins – are independent under the applicable rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (NASDAQ), on which our common stock trades.  
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our independent directors are required to meet at least two times each year.  During 2018, the Company's independent directors continued their longstanding practice of convening executive sessions after regular board meetings as they deemed necessary, convening nine such sessions during 2018.  Neither the Chief Executive Officer nor any other Company employees were present during these executive sessions. 
During 2018, each of the incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and the committees of the Board on which he or she served.  The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that encourage its directors to attend each annual meeting. All of our directors attended the Company's 2018 annual meeting.  
Board and Management Leadership Structure
In connection with its election of the Chairman of the Board, the Board solicits input and nominations from its members and elects one of its members as Chairman. The Chairman or the President of the Company presides over each Board meeting and performs such other duties as may be incident to the office. Although our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines provide the Board with the flexibility to appoint one individual to serve as both  Table of Contents
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, it is the current policy of the Board to separate these offices.  We believe that this separation allows the Chairman to maintain an independent role in management oversight. 
Mr. Estabrook, who has been serving as our Chairman since 2009, is not eligible to stand for re-election per our Corporate Governance Guidelines, having reached the mandatory retirement age. Mr. Levens, the Company's Vice Chairman was recently elected by the Board to serve as Chairman following the Company's annual meeting in April.
Board Committees
The committees established by the Board include an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and a Board Risk Committee. The Board and each committee have the authority to consult with and retain independent legal, financial or other outside advisors, as each deems necessary and appropriate, without seeking approval of management.
The current members of each Board committee are identified in the following table, which also indicates the number of meetings each committee held in fiscal 2018.

[END TABLE]
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Estabrook (Chair), Bertucci, Fowler, Hairston, Horne, Levens (Vice Chair), Liollio, Nickelsen and Ms. Pickering. The Executive Committee's purpose is to provide a means of considering matters that may require Board attention in the intervals between scheduled meetings of the full Board. The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board except as limited by the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law.  All actions of the Executive Committee are deemed to be done under the authority of the Board, with the same force and effect as if the full Board had acted. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is currently comprised of Ms. Pickering (Chair), Messrs. Fowler, Levens, Ms. Little (Vice Chair) and Mr. Olinde. Mr. Olinde was appointed to the Audit Committee effective May 2018.  Mr. Nickelsen  Table of Contents served on the Audit Committee through April 2018. The Board has determined that the Audit Committee members each meet the additional independence criteria of the SEC and NASDAQ for service on the Audit Committee. The Board has classified Ms. Pickering, Ms. Little and Messrs. Fowler and Levens as "audit committee financial experts" as defined in applicable SEC regulations.
The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter, a copy of which is on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.hancockwhitney.com/investors under Corporate Overview - Committee Charting.  Information regarding the functions of the Audit Committee is set forth in the "Audit Committee Report," included on page 52 of this proxy statement.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Fowler (Chair), Horne, Levens, Liollio (Vice Chair), Nickelsen, and Olinde. Messrs. Horne and Levens were appointed to the Compensation Committee effective May 2018.  Mr. Bertucci and Ms. Pickering served on the Compensation Committee through April 2018. The Board has determined that the Compensation Committee members each meet the NASDAQ, SEC and Internal Revenue Code's additional independence criteria for service on the Compensation Committee.  
The primary purpose of the Compensation Committee is to aid the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the compensation of the Company's directors, the Chief Executive Officer, and any executive officer within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for developing, evaluating and approving the Company's compensation plans, policies, and programs. The Compensation Committee also oversees the preparation of and approves the annual report on executive compensation and the narrative disclosure of the Company's risk assessment of compensation policies and practices for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement.  
Our long term incentive plans permit the Compensation Committee to delegate all or any of its responsibilities and powers under the plans to individual officers or associates of the Company or a subsidiary, except its authority or responsibility with regard to awards to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  The Compensation Committee has delegated limited authority to the Company's Chief Executive Officer to make grants outside of the annual long term incentive program, such as grants to new hires and special retention related grants, individually valued in excess of $100,000, and to the Company's Chief Human Resources Officer to make such grants individually valued up to $100,000.  Neither officer is permitted to grant awards to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
The Compensation Committee is governed by a written charter, which further sets forth the Compensation Committee's responsibilities and duties, a copy of which appears on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.hancockwhitney.com/investors under Corporate Overview – Committee Charting.  Additional information regarding the functions and role of the Compensation Committee, including its processes and procedures for the consideration and determination of executive compensation, is set forth under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Role of the Compensation Committee" on page 28.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
The Corporate Governance Committee and Nominating Committee (the Corporate Governance Committee) is currently comprised of Ms. Pickering and Messrs. Horne (Chair), Bertucci, Olinde (Vice Chair), and Wilkins. Messrs. Horne and Wilkins were appointed to the Corporate Governance Committee effective May 2018.  Messrs. Nickelsen and Roseberry served on the Corporate Governance Committee until April 2018. The Board has determined that Ms. Pickering and Messrs. Bertucci, Horne, Olinde and Wilkins are each independent under applicable NASDAQ rules. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees a broad range of issues surrounding the composition and operation of the Board and its committees.  The Corporate Governance Committee's charter is available on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.hancockwhitney.com/investors under Corporate Overview – Committee Charting.
 Director Qualifications, Qualities, and Skills.  The Corporate Governance Committee has adopted criteria that it uses when it recommends individuals to be nominated for election to the Board.  First, a prospective candidate must meet any eligibility and qualification requirements set forth in any Company, Board or Committee governing  Table of Contents documents, as applicable. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee believes that directors must demonstrate a variety of personal traits, leadership qualities, and individual competencies.  The Corporate Governance Committee considers the following criteria in evaluating nominees: integrity, honesty and reputation; financial, regulatory and business experience; familiarity with and participation in one or more communities served by the Bank; dedication to the Company and its shareholders; and independence.  For individuals considered for Board leadership roles, the following skill sets are also required: communication skills, facilitation skills, crisis management skills, and relationship building and networking skills. In considering candidates for director, the Corporate Governance Committee reviews these criteria and skills in light of the composition and needs of the current Board of Directors and its various committees.  
Diversity Considerations.  The Corporate Governance Guidelines do not specifically define diversity.  The Corporate Governance Committee believes that the Board should have directors from diverse backgrounds and with a diversified set of business skills and experience.  In practice, the Corporate Governance Committee has viewed diversity as the collective range of experiences, skills, talents, perspectives, and cultures that all nominees would bring to the Board.  Moreover, the Corporate Governance Committee considers whether the Board, as a whole, reflects the diverse regions and lines of business of our markets and the customers we serve. 
Identification of New Directors. The Corporate Governance Committee may identify potential directors in a number of ways.  The Corporate Governance Committee may consider recommendations made by current or former directors and members of executive management and, where appropriate, the Company may retain a search firm to identify candidates.  In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our shareholders.  The Committee will evaluate candidates recommended by a shareholder in the same manner as candidates identified by the Committee or recommended by others.  The Corporate Governance Committee may choose not to consider an unsolicited recommendation if no vacancy exists on the Board and the Corporate Governance Committee does not perceive a need to increase the size of the Board.
For the Corporate Governance Committee to consider a director candidate for nomination submitted by a shareholder, the shareholder must submit the recommendation in writing to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices.  Each submission must include the same information that would be required for a director directly nominated by a shareholder as specified in our Bylaws. See "Shareholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting" on page 54.  For purposes of the 2020 Annual Meeting, any director recommendation by a shareholder must be received by the Corporate Secretary not later than November 13, 2019.
Board Risk Committee
The Board Risk Committee is comprised of independent Company directors Messrs. Bertucci (Chair), Estabrook, Hanna, Roseberry, Wilkins, Ms. Little, Ms. Pickering and Ms. Teofilo (Vice Chair). Mr. Bertucci and Ms. Pickering were appointed to the Board Risk Committee effective May 2018. Mr. Horne and Mr. Levens served on the Board Risk Committee through April 2018. The Board Risk Committee reviews the Company's processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and managing credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, legal risk, operational risk (including cybersecurity risk), reputational risk, and strategic risk. The Board Risk Committee assesses the operational processes associated with the Company's potential risk related to business recovery, compliance, corporate insurance, and legal. The Board Risk Committee may solicit and receive information from other committees as appropriate to fulfill its enterprise-wide risk management oversight function. The Board Risk Committee acts pursuant to a written charter, a copy of which is available on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.hancockwhitney.com/investors under Corporate Overview – Committee Charting.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board recognizes that risk management is an enterprise-wide responsibility. The Board oversees the Company's corporate risk governance processes primarily through its committees.  The Board (or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) receives reports from the appropriate risk supervisor within the Company to enable it to understand the risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation procedures.  The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in the assessment and management of the Company's policies, procedures and practices relating to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, legal risk, operational risk (including cybersecurity risk), reputational risk, and strategic risk. The Audit Committee reviews the Company's control systems to manage and monitor financial risk with management and the internal audit group.  The  Table of Contents
Compensation Committee evaluates and manages any risks posed by compensation programs.  In addition, the Board and executive management have appointed a Chief Risk Officer, who is a member of management, to support the risk oversight responsibilities of the Board and its committees and to involve the appropriate personnel in risk management by establishing committees responsible for oversight of the many risks faced by the Company. The Chief Risk Officer reports to the Board Risk Committee each quarter on the Company's enterprise-wide risk management systems. 
Board's Role in Oversight of Cyber Risk
Information security is a significant operational risk for financial institutions, and includes the risk of losses resulting from cyber-attacks. Our Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, clients, and employees, and devotes significant time and attention to oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk as a result. In light of these risks, our Board is actively engaged in the oversight of our Company's information security risk management and cyber defense programs. The Board Risk Committee has primary responsibility for this oversight.  In this capacity, the Board Risk Committee oversees the Company's processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing cybersecurity risk. We use a wide array of techniques that are intended to secure our operations and proprietary information such as our Comprehensive Information Security Policy, network monitoring, access controls, dedicated security personnel, and, when necessary, consultation with third-party data security experts.  
The Chief Information Security Officer, a member of management, supports the information security risk oversight responsibilities of the Board and its committees and involves the appropriate personnel in information risk management.  The Chief Information Security Officer attends Board Risk Committee meetings on a quarterly basis and sits in executive session with the Board Risk Committee members twice each year. The Chief Information Security Officer annually provides an Information Security Program Summary report, outlining the overall status of our Information Security Program and the Company's compliance with regulatory guidelines.    
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Cash Compensation
The Compensation Committee periodically engages McLagan, an Aon Hewitt company (McLagan), as its independent compensation consultant, to review our director compensation program, including a comparison of our program against the programs of the bank and financial holding companies in our Peer Bank Group (see description of this group in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis). The last such comparison was completed in 2017. After reviewing McLagan's 2017 report, the Compensation Committee approved increases to the annual retainers of the Chairman of the Board from $60,000 to $80,000, introduced a Vice Chairman of the Board annual retainer of $25,000, for a total of $55,000 in annual retainers for the Vice Chairman, and increased the annual retainer for committee chairs of the Board Risk and Corporate Governance Committees from $7,500 to $10,000. These were the only changes to the cash portion of the program for 2018. 
During 2018, the Company paid its non-employee directors annual retainer fees of $30,000, except that the Chairman of the Board received an additional annual retainer fee of $50,000 and the Vice Chairman of the Board received an additional annual retainer fee of $25,000. The Company paid additional annual retainers to committee chairs as follows:  Audit Committee, $12,500; Compensation Committee, $10,000; Board Risk Committee, $10,000; Credit Risk Management Subcommittee of the Board Risk Committee, $10,000; and Corporate Governance Committee, $10,000.  Although this does not apply to our current committee composition, any director chairing multiple committees is only paid the higher committee chair retainer.  In addition to the retainer, the Company paid non-employee directors a fee of $1,750 per Board meeting attended and directors serving on any committees are paid $1,000 for each committee meeting attended. The Bank's board of directors is composed of the same individuals who serve as members of the Company's Board. Non-employee Company directors do not receive any additional fees for service on the Bank board.  In addition, as part of our community outreach efforts we maintain "market boards" in many of our market areas.  Leading members of the community are asked to serve on these market boards together with management.  Market board members provide management with insight into trends and opportunities in our key markets and support and promote the Bank in the communities served.  We may request that our Company directors also serve on a market board.  Non-employee Company directors serving on our market boards do not receive any additional fees for such service. Table of Contents
Each non-employee director may elect to receive payment of the retainer fees and meeting fees in the form of cash; in shares of Company common stock purchased through the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (not to exceed $100,000 in Company common stock per year with the remainder paid in cash); in shares of Company common stock granted under the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan; or they may elect to defer all or any portion of their fees under the Company's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Board elected to increase the amount of the annual Board retainer, introduce Committee retainers, and eliminate per-meeting fees.  We believe that paying increased annual retainers based on board and committee service and leadership roles and eliminating per-meeting fees appropriately aligns each of our director's compensation with their respective responsibilities.  Additionally, this change will better align our director compensation program with the compensation structures of our peers and ensures that we are able to provide a competitive compensation program that allows us to attract and retain qualified directors.
Equity Compensation
Non-employee directors receive an annual equity grant that is aligned with the annual meeting of shareholders and the annual retainer service period. This grant is issued in the form of restricted stock with a one-year service-based vesting condition. For 2018, each non-employee director received an annual grant of restricted stock valued at $45,000. The number of shares delivered was based on the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to the award, rounded to the nearest whole share.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
Pursuant to our director stock ownership guidelines, directors are expected to own either 5,000 shares of Company common stock or stock worth five times their annual cash retainer. The valuation is based on the closing price on the last trading day of the preceding calendar year. The minimum share guidelines will be re-evaluated at least once every five years to account for significant fee structure changes. Directors have five years from the date of their election to the Board to satisfy the stock ownership expectation. If a director does not reach his or her guideline at the end of the applicable period, the director must hold one-half of any shares acquired from the Company until the guideline is met. As of December 31, 2018, all of our current directors met the ownership guidelines, with the exception of directors Ms. Little and Ms. Teofilo, who were appointed or elected to the Board in 2016.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This section of the proxy statement describes and analyzes our executive compensation philosophy and program in the context of the compensation paid during our 2018 fiscal year to individuals who served as our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer during the year and our three other most highly-compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of the fiscal year (who are referred to herein as our named executive officers, or NEOs). Our fiscal 2018 NEOs are: 
John M. Hairston, President and CEO
Michael M. Achary, Chief Financial Officer
Joseph S. Exnicios, President, Hancock Whitney Bank
D. Shane Loper, Chief Operating Officer
Cecil W. "Chip" Knight, Jr., Chief Banking Officer
Later in this proxy statement under the heading "Executive Compensation," we have included tables containing specific information about the compensation earned by or paid to our NEOs in 2018.  The discussion below is intended to summarize and explain the detailed information provided in those tables and to put that information into the context of our overall compensation program.
We refer to the non-GAAP financial measures Operating Revenue, Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue, and Operating Net Income and Earnings per Share (Operating EPS) throughout this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, refer to Appendix A to this proxy statement.  For more information about our business, please see "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Executive Summary
Overview of Company Performance in Fiscal 2018
2018 was a year of significant accomplishments for the Company. For the full year, net income was up 50%, earnings per share (EPS) increased $1.24 to $3.72, return on assets (ROA) was up 35 bps to 1.17%, loans grew $1 billion to end the year at $20 billion, commercial criticized loans declined $451 million, or 42%, we achieved our goal of reducing our energy exposure to approximately 5%, and the tangible common equity ratio ended the year at 8.02%.
As further discussed below, a portion of the Company's annual incentive plan is based on pre-determined goals measured by the financial performance of the Company, including growth in operating earnings per share, operating pre-provision net revenue, total loans and total deposits. The Company's accomplishments of these goals for 2018 follow:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increase in operating earnings per share of 38% for the year ending December 31, 2018 
• An increase in operating pre-provision net revenue of $37.5 million, or 9%, for the year ending December 31, 2018 
• An increase in average total loans of $1.1 billion, or 6%, for the year ending December 31, 2018 
• An increase in average total deposits of $1.3 billion, or 6%, for the year ending December 31, 2018 
[END TABLE]
In addition to these financial accomplishments, we consolidated our two iconic brands mid-year to become Hancock Whitney Corporation and Hancock Whitney Bank, we began the move to our new regional headquarters in downtown New Orleans, and we completed two significant transactions: the divestiture of Harrison Finance Company and Harrison Loan Company in March and the acquisition of Capital One's trust and asset management business in July. We achieved some of our 2019 corporate strategic objectives during 2018, and adopted new ones early this year, which target what we believe will be better performance and profitability into the future.

Overview of our Compensation Programs
Our compensation program is aligned with short- and long-term Company performance and includes best practices designed to reflect sound corporate governance. As described further below, with the exception of base salary and a minority of our annual equity awards, all direct compensation is performance-based. Executives are also subject to stock ownership guidelines as well as post-vest holding periods on equity awards. The short-term cash incentives awarded under our annual performance plan reward our executives for achievement of short-term goals aligned with our fiscal year operating plan. The long-term incentive plan rewards our executives for achievement of long-term goals measured over a multi-year period. Together, these plans support our operating strategy to provide customers with the financial sophistication and range of products of a regional bank, while successfully retaining the commercial appeal and level of service of a community bank. The Company's size and scale and associated compensation program enable us to attract and retain high quality associates who are focused on executing this strategy.
Our priority is growing revenue in our existing markets, while controlling expenses. We have invested in promoting new and enhanced products that contribute to the goal of diversifying our sources of revenue and increasing deposit funding. Our annual performance plan is primarily based on achievement of these Company performance goals, which are further discussed below under "Annual Cash Incentive." Awards under our long-term incentive plan include performance-based restricted stock, which we refer to as "performance stock awards," and time-based restricted stock. Performance stock awards are earned based on achievement of operating earnings per share (operating EPS) and total shareholder return (TSR) over a three-year period. To the extent earned, performance stock awards convert into unrestricted shares after performance results for the performance period are certified and a two-year post vest hold has been met. Restricted stock vests incrementally on each of the first three anniversaries of their respective grant dates and are also subject to a two-year post-vest holding period. The value of the long-term incentive awards increases or decreases as our share price increases or decreases, thereby aligning the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. Awards under our long-term incentive plan for fiscal 2018 are discussed below under "Long-Term Incentive Plan."
Impact of Performance on 2018 Compensation
The following results and key decisions by our Compensation Committee support our pay for performance philosophy and also highlight the Compensation Committee's focus on protecting our shareholders' interests.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligning Base Pay Closer to Market. The Compensation Committee's philosophy is that executives' base salaries should generally target the market 50th percentile of the Peer Bank Group.  In spite of this philosophy, base salaries have historically lagged behind peers. After reviewing the Peer Bank Group compensation study (discussed below) and deliberation, the Compensation Committee approved base salary increases, which moved each of our NEOs closer to the targeted level.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Cash Incentive Determination. After reviewing our overall financial performance compared to regional and top quartile peers and the progress towards meeting our internal corporate strategic objectives, the Compensation Committee determined that annual cash incentive awards to our executive officers were warranted and approved a corporate completion percentage of 125.15% of target levels. Accordingly, based on our achievement of performance goals for fiscal 2018, the NEOs earned above target payout levels under our annual performance plan. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting of Performance Awards.  Performance awards granted in 2016 with a performance period ending in December 2018 were vested collectively at 142.25% of target based on our achievement of Total Shareholder Return compared to our peers and core EPS compared to target. Collectively, our NEOs' vested performance awards are valued at over $2,176,435, calculated using the closing stock price of our common stock on December 28, 2018, the last trading day prior to the end of the performance period.

Consideration of Last Year's Advisory Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, 97% of the votes cast approved the compensation of our named executive officers, as discussed and disclosed in the 2018 proxy statement. The Board and the Compensation Committee appreciate and value the views of our shareholders. In considering the results of this advisory vote on executive compensation, the Committee concluded that the compensation paid to our named executive officers and the Company's overall pay practices have strong shareholder support.
In light of the strong shareholder support of the compensation paid to our named executive officers as evidenced by the results of this advisory vote, the Compensation Committee decided to retain our general approach to executive compensation for 2018.  Future advisory votes on executive compensation will serve as an additional tool to guide the Compensation Committee in evaluating the alignment of the Company's executive compensation programs with the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In Proposal No. 2 below, shareholders are being asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs for 2018 as disclosed in the proxy statement.
Executive Compensation Best Practices
Our executive compensation program is designed to create an appropriate linkage between executive pay, Company performance, and the return on shareholder investment. The Compensation Committee works with its independent consultants to evaluate the program and maintain alignment with shareholders' interests and to incorporate strong governance standards within our compensation program, such as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Significant Percentage of Executive Target Compensation is Performance-Based.  Approximately 60% of Mr. Hairston's total target direct compensation (base salary, target annual incentive, and target long-term incentive awards) and approximately 50% of the total target direct compensation of our other NEOs is performance-based, meaning that either it is at risk and must be earned on the basis of attainment of corporate and individual performance goals (in the case of annual incentive awards and performance stock awards) or its future value is contingent upon the future performance of the Company's common stock (in the case of our performance stock awards and time-based restricted stock awards).    
• A Significant Percentage of Executive Target Compensation is Performance-Based.  Approximately 60% of Mr. Hairston's total target direct compensation (base salary, target annual incentive, and target long-term incentive awards) and approximately 50% of the total target direct compensation of our other NEOs is performance-based, meaning that either it is at risk and must be earned on the basis of attainment of corporate and individual performance goals (in the case of annual incentive awards and performance stock awards) or its future value is contingent upon the future performance of the Company's common stock (in the case of our performance stock awards and time-based restricted stock awards).    
• Majority of Long-Term Incentives Based on Stock Performance.  As CEO, Mr. Hairston received 70% of his equity grant in performance-based awards, and the other NEOs received 60% of their equity grant in performance-based awards. The Compensation Committee believes that weighting the equity grants more toward performance-based awards provides better alignment of the executives' compensation with our shareholders' interests.   
• Mandated Post-Vest Holding Periods.  Long term incentive awards granted to our executive officers include a mandatory two-year post-vest holding requirement. This holding requirement supports alignment between our executives and our shareholders, focuses the executives on long-term sustained performance, and reduces the grant date fair value of the award for accounting purposes, thus reducing the expense of the equity program to the Company. These post vest holding periods are in addition to meaningful executive stock ownership requirements.   
• Mandated Post-Vest Holding Periods.  Long term incentive awards granted to our executive officers include a mandatory two-year post-vest holding requirement. This holding requirement supports alignment between our executives and our shareholders, focuses the executives on long-term sustained performance, and reduces the grant date fair value of the award for accounting purposes, thus reducing the expense of the equity program to the Company. These post vest holding periods are in addition to meaningful executive stock ownership requirements.   
• No Excise Tax Gross-Up Provisions.  None of the change in control agreements in place for our NEOs or other executives provides for excise tax gross-ups.  Instead, these agreements provide for a "best of net" approach to address any potential excise tax payments that might be triggered by a change in control.  (See "Elements of Our Compensation Program – Use of Employment Contracts and Change in Control Agreements" herein.)   
• Clawback Policy.  The Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy that empowers the Board to recover a bonus, other incentive compensation paid, or other performance based equity compensation awarded to any executive officer in appropriate circumstances where there has been a material restatement of the Company's financial statements.

• Limited Perquisites.  We generally provide only limited perquisites to our executives, consistent with our goal of aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our shareholders.   
• Limited Perquisites.  We generally provide only limited perquisites to our executives, consistent with our goal of aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our shareholders.   
• Executive Stock Ownership Requirements.  Under our stock ownership guidelines, our CEO must own either 90,000 shares or stock worth five times his base salary, and our other executive officers must own either 30,000 shares or stock worth three times their base salary.  Executive officers have five years from the date of employment, or promotion to an executive officer position, to meet the stock ownership requirement. If an executive does not own the requisite number of shares by the required date, the executive must retain ownership of one-half of any shares acquired from the Company (net of any tax withholdings) until the ownership requirement is met.   
• Trading Restrictions.  The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits our executive officers from engaging in speculative trading activities with respect to our common stock through derivative or futures contracts such as puts, calls or short sales.  
[END TABLE]
Objectives of the Company's Compensation Program
Our compensation program is designed to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• drive performance in support of the Company's financial goals, balancing short-term and intermediate operational objectives and performance with long-term strategic goals;  
• align executives' long-term rewards with the interests of our shareholders;   
• provide increased compensation opportunities for exceptional individual performance, which can result in differentiated compensation among executives who are otherwise of comparable rank; and 
• place at risk a significant portion of total compensation, making it contingent on Company performance but in a manner consistent with our risk management policies.  
[END TABLE]
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is responsible for annually assessing the performance of our NEOs and for determining both their annual salary and incentive (short- and long-term) compensation opportunities.  Each of the members of our Compensation Committee is independent as defined under SEC and IRC rules and NASDAQ listing standards.  The Committee may form and delegate responsibility to subcommittees of the Committee as necessary or appropriate. The Compensation Committee from time to time retains independent executive compensation consultants to assist in evaluating the compensation practices of the Company and to provide advice and ongoing recommendations regarding executive compensation practices consistent with our business goals and pay philosophy.  
In 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged McLagan to provide this advisory service to the Compensation Committee, which the Committee considered in connection with setting executive compensation for 2018. The scope of McLagan's executive compensation consulting assignments included a comparison of our current levels of base salary, annual cash incentive opportunity and equity-based compensation to those paid by bank and financial holding companies in the Peer Bank Group (listed below). McLagan performed services solely on behalf of the Compensation Committee and has no other relationship with the Company or its management.  The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of McLagan under the applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules and concluded that McLagan's engagement presented no conflicts of interest.  The Compensation Committee considered data developed by McLagan in its assessment of whether each element of the executives' compensation package was competitive with the market and to determine whether any adjustments were appropriate.  This information was also used to establish the parameters of long-term incentives granted to the NEOs. 
Role of Executives in Compensation Committee Deliberations
The Compensation Committee works closely with the Chief Human Resources Officer and other members of the Company's human resources team, who provide administrative support to the Compensation Committee, as requested.  Executives may attend a Compensation Committee meeting to discuss Company and individual performance or to provide pertinent financial, tax, accounting, or operational information.  Executives in attendance may provide their insights and suggestions, but only the independent Compensation Committee members have the right to vote on decisions regarding executive compensation.   Table of Contents
For each executive officer other than himself, the Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding compensation.  The Compensation Committee reviews recommendations made by our Chief Executive Officer and information from the McLagan executive compensation review in determining compensation levels and program designs for our executives.  The Compensation Committee's decisions are based on a variety of factors, including short- and long-term Company performance, the officer's level of responsibility, an assessment of individual performance and competitive market data. The Chief Executive Officer is excused from the meeting before decisions are made on his compensation.
Role of Compensation Consultant and Review of Market Data
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and analyzes market data provided by McLagan in an effort to ensure that our executive officer compensation is competitive.  Such a review was conducted in 2017, which served as a guide to the Committee in setting our 2018 executive compensation levels. As part of this review, we compared compensation paid to our executive officers with compensation paid to the named executive officers in similar positions at banks of comparable size (which we refer to as the Peer Bank Group).  The Committee used the market information compiled as well as additional information regarding the ongoing movement of executive compensation in the banking industry to test the reasonableness of the compensation decisions we made for 2018. McLagan conducted another review of executive compensation in October 2018, which was used to make compensation decisions for 2019.
In connection with McLagan's 2017 review of executive compensation, we determined it was appropriate to refresh the Peer Bank Group in order to ensure that the group reflects changes to both our organization and peer banks over the intervening years. The Peer Bank Group is designed to align with the Company's business profile and external environment, and positions the Company close to the peer group median in terms of asset size. The 2017 Peer Bank Group is comprised of banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies with total assets ranging from $13.9 billion to $43.0 billion at the time of selection. The median total assets for the 2017 Peer Bank Group was $24.2 billion, which positioned the Company at the 66th percentile of the peer group at the time of selection. We referred to the 2017 Peer Bank Group in establishing compensation levels and program design features for 2018. The Peer Bank Group was updated in connection with McLagan's 2018 executive compensation review, which we referred to when determining 2019 compensation.
The Company's 2017 Peer Bank Group consists of the following 20 banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies (the * indicates a company that has been acquired since the original establishment of the peer group and therefore is no longer considered a peer company):

How We Determine and Assess Executive Compensation
We believe that the total compensation package available to our executives should provide the opportunity for enhanced levels of financial reward for achievement of higher levels of performance; should recognize and reward both short- and long-term performance; and should be competitive with our peers so we can attract and retain talented and skilled executives. After careful consideration and analysis of market survey data provided by the Compensation Committee's executive compensation consultant, executive officer compensation is set at levels we believe to be competitive with the Company's Peer Bank Group and compatible with our internal business plans.  While the Compensation Committee considers many factors in setting executive compensation, generally the Compensation Committee strives to achieve a market position for an executive's total compensation at approximately the median of the Peer Bank Group assuming the Company's performance is consistent with that group.
Elements of Our Compensation Program
In 2018 our executive officer compensation program consisted of the following elements:  base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity incentives, retirement benefits, change of control protections and other benefits, including limited perquisites.
Base Salary
We pay base salaries to our executive officers as compensation for performing their day-to-day responsibilities. Base salaries are set based on a variety of factors, including competitive pay levels within the Peer Bank Group and our industry, internal pay alignment and equity, and an overall assessment of Company and individual performance.  We rely substantially on industry and Peer Bank Group salary survey data provided by the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant to evaluate whether the base salaries of our executives are competitive in the marketplace and also evaluate the actual performance of each executive to determine if base salary increases are warranted. The Compensation Committee may, however, set an executive's salary above the Peer Bank Group median if it determines that specific performance, needs or other circumstances justify a base salary at a higher level.
On October 26, 2017, after review and discussion of the 2017 Peer Bank Group compensation study, the Compensation Committee determined that the base salaries of our executives were below the competitive range for peer executives and approved the following base salary increases for each of our NEOs effective April 1, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO  2017 Salary  Increase effective 2018  2018 Salary  Percentage Increase 
 John M. Hairston  $865,000  $60,000   $925,000  6.94% 
 Michael M. Achary  $460,000  $25,000   $485,000  5.43% 
 Joseph S. Exnicios  $460,000  $25,000   $485,000  5.43% 
 D. Shane Loper  $480,000  $37,500   $517,500  7.81% 
 Cecil W. Knight Jr.   $420,000  $25,000   $445,000  5.95% 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee's philosophy is that executives' base salaries should target the market 50th percentile of the Peer Bank Group. After reviewing the Peer Bank Group compensation study and deliberation, the Compensation Committee approved base salary increases noted above, which moved each of our NEOs closer to this targeted level, while also accounting for any changes in responsibility. Base salaries of our NEOs individually and in aggregate continue to remain somewhat below the market median, however all salaries are now within 15% of peer medians.
Annual Cash Incentive
The Company uses annual cash incentives to focus attention on current strategic priorities and drive achievement of short-term corporate strategic objectives.  The annual cash incentive plan was designed to focus executive officers towards continuing to improve both corporate and individual performance.  In furtherance of this goal, each of the two components of the annual cash incentive plan, corporate performance and individual performance, is independently funded and evaluated. Further, the relative weighting of the corporate and individual components varies by executive, based on the level of corporate responsibility and the impact each executive's position has on the corporate components.  Table of Contents
Under the annual cash incentive plan, our NEOs were eligible to receive an annual cash incentive award based on a target percentage of their annual base salary earnings (100% for Mr. Hairston; 70% for the other NEOs.) For 2018, the table below discloses for each NEO the weighting and the award payout levels of each performance component:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Cecil W. Knight Jr.  60%  0%  100%  200%  40%  0%  100% 
[END TABLE]
To determine the final completion percentage of the corporate component, the Compensation Committee uses two assessment measures: 1) actual corporate performance compared to pre-established corporate performance goals, and 2) the Company's performance compared to the performance of certain regional peers and the performance of a top quartile peer group (consisting of top performing banks in the country based upon their three-year ROAA with assets ranging from $10 billion to $30 billion), together with a review of the Company's progress with respect to certain corporate strategic objectives. Based on the Company's performance against pre-established performance goals, our performance relative to a regional and top quartile group's performance, as well as our corporate strategic objectives, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to increase or decrease the completion percentage of the corporate component.  
For 2018, the corporate component of the annual cash incentive plan used four key performance measurement metrics:  operating EPS, operating pre-provision net revenue, average annual loan growth, and average annual deposit growth.  The Compensation Committee may also approve additional adjustments as it deems appropriate as discussed below based on its overall assessment of Company performance against the performance of regional and top quartile peers and consideration of other corporate strategic objectives. The individual component of the plan is determined based on a subjective assessment by the Compensation Committee of each executive's performance relative to certain pre-established goals, as described below.  
The financial performance goals under the corporate component of the 2018 Executive Incentive Plan and actual results for 2018 are set forth below:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporate Performance Goal% of Corporate Component  2018 Threshold (Represents 80% Completion of Target)  2018 Target  2018 Maximum (Represents 120% Completion)  2018 Actual Results

 Average Annual Deposits  20%  $18.01 billion  $22.51 billion  $27.01 billion  $22.16 billion 
[END TABLE]
With respect to the individual components, the goals in 2018 for each executive were generally grouped into the following categories: 1) leadership competency, 2) operational objectives, 3) budget adherence, 4) expense initiative run rate adherence, and 5) adherence to regulatory requirements and risk controls. The individual goals were evaluated by the Compensation Committee (for all officers) and the CEO (for officers other than himself) based on the performance of each executive in those areas.

[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentives
The purpose of our long-term incentive program is to ensure that our executives focus not only on short-term returns but also on achieving long-term Company goals, growth and creation of shareholder value.  We further believe that equity ownership by our executive officers aligns executives' interests with those of our shareholders.  In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued its practice of using only performance stock awards (PSAs) and time-based restricted stock awards (RSAs) for long-term incentive compensation, with a higher percentage of the total award value being delivered to our NEOs in the form of PSAs. This relative weighting of the award values strengthens the alignment of the executive and shareholder interests. The PSAs only provide value to the executive if our TSR exceeds a threshold of performance relative to our peers and if certain operational objectives are achieved, as described below. However, we continue to use RSAs as a portion of our long-term awards because we believe they provide an effective retention incentive for the executives and align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders.  
The Compensation Committee sets the target value of the equity awards granted as a percentage of each executive's base salary, with the target percentage based upon the executive's position.  We believe using a percentage of base salary as the target provides us greater control and consistency relative to the value of equity awards we grant each year.  For 2018, the long-term incentive allocations for the NEOs were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NamedExecutive Officer  Target Value of LTI as a% of Base Salary  LTI Target Value% Delivered in Performance Awards% Delivered in Restricted Stock  
 John M. Hairston  150%  $1,387,500  70%  30% 
 Michael M. Achary  90%     $436,500  60%  40% 
 Joseph S. Exnicios  90%     $436,500  60%  40% 
 D. Shane Loper  90%     $465,750  60%  40% 
 Cecil W. Knight Jr.  80%     $356,000  60%  40% 
[END TABLE]
The RSAs vest based on continued service, with the awards granted in 2018 vesting in annual increments over a three-year period. The PSAs granted as part of the 2018 program (which were approved in October 2018 with a grant date in January 2019) are described below. Both the restricted stock and performance stock awards granted under the 2018 program include a two-year post-vest holding period applicable to the net shares issued upon vesting of the award and payment of withholding taxes.
For the PSAs approved in 2018, the Company bifurcated the grant into two equally weighted awards, one using a three-year relative TSR performance metric and the other a two-year EPS metric. We believe these performance metrics provide a direct alignment of executive and shareholder interests.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TSR Awards – The payout level of the TSR award is determined based on the relative rank of the Company's TSR among a 43 company peer group (from the KBW Regional Bank Index), which is the same peer group used for these performance awards since the inception of the program, except for companies that have been removed due to acquisitions. If over the three-year measurement period the Company's TSR performance is below the peer group's 25th percentile, no portion of the award is earned; if the Company's TSR performance is at or above the 50th percentile, 100% of the target award is earned; and if the Company's TSR performance is at or above the 75th percentile, 200% of the target award is earned.  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating EPS Awards – The operating EPS award has a two-year performance measurement period followed by a one-year service period. Between 0% and 200% of the target award will be earned based upon the level of collective operating EPS achieved over the performance period as compared to the target level, with 80% of target operating EPS earning 50% payout and 120% of target operating EPS earning 200% payout. The two-year EPS goals have been selected by the Compensation Committee and reflect our strategic plan as well as projected growth targets. The Compensation Committee believes that the growth targets represent appropriately challenging performance that will lead to increased shareholder value if achieved. 
[END TABLE]
For all PSAs granted, results that fall in-between the "maximum," "target" and "minimum" levels of the applicable performance criteria will be paid out on a sliding scale. Because the PSAs granted as part of the 2018 long-term incentive program have a January 2019 grant date, they are not reflected in the "Summary Compensation Table" or "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" herein (although the award for each NEO is described below).  Rather, the PSAs associated with the 2017 long-term incentive program (which were granted in January 2018) are shown, in accordance with proxy reporting methodology.
Our NEOs received the following long-term incentive awards for fiscal year 2018 (including PSAs granted in January 2019):

[END TABLE]
2017 PSAs – In 2017, the Compensation Committee approved PSA Awards for NEOs that were structured the same as the PSAs approved in 2018, as described above. The 2017 PSA Awards were approved in October 2017, but had a January 2018 grant date, and are thus reflected as 2018 compensation in the "Summary Compensation table" and "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" herein.
Vesting of 2015 PSAs – The three-year period from 2016-2018 for the PSAs approved in 2015 ended December 31, 2018. One-half of these PSAs could be earned based on the Company's TSR relative to a peer group for the three-year performance period. The Company's relative TSR compared to the applicable peer group was above the 75th percentile, which resulted in our executive officers vesting at 200.00% of the target awards. The other half of these PSAs could be earned based upon achievement of collective core EPS relative to a two-year performance goal.  The Company's collective EPS was above the threshold of 80%, which resulted in our executive officers vesting at 84.5% of the target awards. In the aggregate, our NEOs vested in 142.25% of the targeted shares equaling 62,812 shares valued at $2,176,435 as of December 28, 2018.
Retirement Benefits
Retirement benefits also play an important role within our overall executive compensation strategy because providing our executives with financial security at retirement means they are incentivized to remain long-term employees of our Company.  Based on information provided by the Compensation Committee's consultant, we believe that our retirement program, including the benefits that are earned based on service, is comparable to programs offered by the companies in our Peer Bank Group.  Our retirement program continues to be an essential component to ensure that our executive compensation program remains competitive. Table of Contents
During 2018, the Company maintained the following two retirement plans available to all eligible employees:
• Hancock Whitney Corporation Pension Plan
• Hancock Whitney Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan 
The Hancock Whitney Corporation Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan was also available to our NEOs, and Mr. Exnicios remains eligible for benefits under the Whitney Holding Corporation Retirement Restoration Plan.  These plans are described in more detail under "Executive Compensation – Pension Benefits" and "Executive Compensation – Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" herein.
Perquisites and Other Benefits 
We seek to maintain a cost conscious culture in connection with the benefits we provide to our executive officers, consistent with our objective to tie a significant portion of executive compensation to Company performance. Our NEOs receive limited perquisites, such as club memberships, free parking, and a Company provided auto allowance.  The Company also charters aircraft that the NEOs may use periodically. As outlined in the Company's Corporate Aviation Usage Policy, personal use of the aircraft is discouraged.  However, any personal use of the aircraft, including a spouse flying to attend a business function but not a formal part of the agenda, will trigger imputed income to the NEO calculated according to IRS guidelines.  In situations where a spouse is required to attend an event and is not a formal part of the agenda as outlined in the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will pay to the NEO a grossed-up amount equal to the tax on such imputed income incurred by the NEO. We also provide our executive officers long-term disability insurance coverage that provides tax-free benefits.  Based on information provided by the Compensation Committee's consultant, we believe the perquisites provided to our NEOs are reasonable in light of industry practices and perquisites available to executive officers of the companies in our Peer Bank Group.  We review the perquisites provided to our executive officers periodically to ensure that our benefits are consistent with our overall compensation objective of providing competitive compensation to our executive officers. 
Employment Contracts and Change in Control Agreements
We do not have employment contracts with the NEOs.  However, each NEO has a change in control agreement that protects the executive's employment for a period of time following a change in control of the Company.  The occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control would create uncertainty regarding whether the employment of our executive officers whom we consider to be key employees would be continued.  In the Compensation Committee's view, providing these change in control protections better enables the executive officers to focus on the Company's business and serve the shareholders' interests, particularly during periods of consolidation or merger and acquisition activity within the banking industry.  
Each NEO's change in control agreement, among other things, protects the executive's employment for two years following a change in control of the Company.  Under the agreements, if the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause during the protected period following a change in control, then the executive is entitled to a severance payment equal to a multiple of two or three times his base salary plus the average bonus paid to the executive for the three fiscal years preceding the termination, and continued medical coverage of 24 or 36 months, depending on the executive's position. The executive is also entitled to this severance payment if the executive resigns due to disability during the protected period or because of a material change in his base salary or duties or his relocation during the protected period after notice and an opportunity to cure is provided to the Company. Under these agreements, the NEOs are responsible for any excise tax payments due. The change in control agreements had an initial term of three years ending December 31, 2017 and then automatically renew for successive three-year terms beginning on January 1st of the year immediately following the end of each term, unless either the Company or the executive elects to terminate the agreement at the end of its then current term no later than October 31st preceding the renewal date. The agreements carried forward for an additional term after the initial term expired. The agreements also bind the executives to certain non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality covenants.  These agreements are described in more detail under "Executive Compensation – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" herein.  Table of Contents
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
The Compensation Committee considers the tax and accounting implications in the design of its compensation programs. For example, in the selection of long-term incentive instruments, the Compensation Committee reviews the projected expense amounts and expense timing associated with alternative types of awards. The grant-date fair value of share-based awards that are settled in stock, such as RSAs and PSAs, is expensed over the service period or vesting period of the grant. For those grants with a two-year post-vest holding requirement, the grant-date fair value is reduced by a liquidity discount to reflect the holding period requirement. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, prohibits us from deducting more than $1 million in compensation paid to certain executive officers in a single year. Prior to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, an exception to the $1 million limit was available for "performance-based compensation" that meets certain requirements.  In prior years, in connection with making decisions on executive compensation, the Committee took into consideration the provisions of Section 162(m), with the intent to maximize the effectiveness of our compensation programs by taking into consideration the requirements of performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), while also maintaining flexibility and reserving the right to award non-deductible compensation as it deemed appropriate. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We believe that the executive officers of our Company should maintain equity interests in the Company to ensure that they have a meaningful economic stake in the Company and that the interests of our executives and our shareholders are aligned.  Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted stock ownership guidelines that require our executive officers to own directly or indirectly a minimum level of Company common stock, depending upon the executive's position. Shares held by the executive or the executive's spouse, including, without limitation, shares held for the account of the executive in the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, a brokerage account, the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan, or the Company's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan are deemed owned by the executive under the guidelines. Under the guidelines, our Chief Executive Officer is required to maintain ownership of either 90,000 shares of Company common stock or stock worth five (5) times his base salary.  Each of our other executive officers is required to maintain ownership of either 30,000 shares of Company common stock or stock worth three (3) times his or her base salary. The valuation will be based on the closing price on the last trading day of the preceding calendar year.  The executives have five years from the date of their designation as an executive officer to satisfy these ownership requirements.  In addition, if an executive officer does not reach his or her guideline at the end of the applicable period, the executive officer must hold one-half of any shares acquired from the Company (net of any tax withholdings) until the guideline is met. Currently all of our NEOs meet the ownership guidelines with the exception of Mr. Knight who has five years from his designation in 2016 as an executive officer to meet the guidelines.
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
In connection with the Compensation Committee's evaluation and review of the Company's policies and practices of compensating its associates, including executives and non-executive associates, as such policies and practices relate to risk management practices and risk-taking, the Compensation Committee has determined that its compensation plans and practices are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (2)  Amounts reflect the grant date fair value of restricted shares and performance stock awards (PSAs) granted during the year, calculated in accordance with FASB Topic 718. The grant date fair value of the restricted shares is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, as adjusted for an illiquidity discount related to the post-vest holding requirement. The grant date fair value of the PSAs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation method, as set forth in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to PSAs, amounts included in the table are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions for the year assuming achievement of the performance conditions at "target" levels. The grant date value of the PSAs, assuming achievement of performance conditions at the highest level, would be as follows:

CEO Pay Ratio 
We believe executive pay must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our associates to create shareholder value. Our CEO to median associate pay ratio is calculated in accordance with SEC requirements pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median associate by examining the 2018 W-2 Box 5 Wages (Medicare Wages and Tips) for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 30, 2018, the last day of our payroll year. We included all associates, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or on call basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to W-2 Box 5 Wages, and we did not annualize the compensation for any associates that were not employed by us for all of 2018. We believe the use of W-2 Box 5 Wages for all associates is a consistently applied compensation measure. 
After identifying the median associate, we calculated annual total compensation for such associate using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above. The total annual compensation of our median employee was $57,726. The total annual compensation of our CEO was $3,696,113. Accordingly, the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay was 64:1.
The following table below sets forth the individual grants of plan-based awards made to each of our NEOs during 2018.

____________________________
The Hancock Whitney Corporation Pension Plan covers certain eligible employees of the Company upon the completion of one year of service and the attainment of age 21. In 2017, the plan was amended to exclude any individual hired or rehired by the Company after June 30, 2017 from eligibility to participate. Additionally, the amendment provides that the accrual of benefits of each participant whose combined age plus years of service as of January 1, 2018 totals less than 55 will be frozen. Benefits under the plan are determined as the sum of 1% of compensation multiplied by years of service and 0.5% of compensation in excess of a 35-year average of the social security wage base multiplied by years of service. The benefits are determined using base pay, but excluding bonuses and other items of extraordinary compensation.  The Internal Revenue Service limits compensation that may be considered for purposes of calculating plan benefits.  In 2018, this limit was $275,000.  Benefits are payable in the form of actuarially-equivalent annuities, following separation from service and attainment of the normal (age 65) or early (age 55 and 10 years of service) retirement age.  Early retirement benefits are subject to actuarial reduction. Table of Contents
Mr. Exnicios also participates in the Whitney Holding Corporation Retirement Restoration Plan, which is a nonqualified retirement plan that supplements benefits payable from the tax-qualified plan. This plan was acquired by the Company in connection with the merger with Whitney Holding Corporation and only former employees of Whitney Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries were eligible for participation.  Benefits are determined as the difference between retirement benefits determined under the Whitney National Bank Retirement Plan (now merged into the Hancock Whitney Corporation Pension Plan) without regard to the applicable compensation limits and benefits actually payable from that plan taking into account all applicable limitations.  Effective January 1, 2013, all benefit accruals under this plan were frozen.
The following table provides information regarding our Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides for the deferral of compensation on a basis that is not tax-qualified.

_____________________________ Table of Contents
Under our Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may elect a maximum deferral of 80% of base salary, 100% of annual incentive bonus, and 100% of long term incentive awards (in the form of performance units and restricted units – annual grants only).  The minimum deferral for base salary and annual incentive bonus amounts to $3,000 in the aggregate.  There is no minimum deferral for long-term incentive awards.  
Company contributions are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Each year, a 401(k) restoration matching contribution may be made to participant accounts. Unless otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, a participant shall be vested in his Company restoration matching account at the time or times and in the amounts determined in accordance with the provisions of the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan. The plan also allows for supplemental contributions to be made to participants at the discretion of the Compensation Committee (referred to as SERP contributions). The factors taken into consideration for these contributions are current total compensation and a reasonable estimate of final pay at retirement, years of service while eligible for supplemental contributions, remaining with the Company until age 65, a reasonable estimate of growth in the value of the supplemental contribution account investments over the years prior to retirement, and the growth of the supplemental contribution account based on actual investment opportunities deemed to be credited to the supplemental contribution account. The participant will vest in the supplemental contribution account on a 10-year graded vesting schedule beginning at age 51 and ending at age 60.  Each participant will be 100% vested at age 60.
Participants elect the investment options in which their deferrals are deemed to be invested from a group of measurement funds made available under the plan by the Compensation Committee.  The participants may allocate and reallocate the investments of their deferral accounts among such investment options on a daily basis subject to certain limitations. Earnings or losses are allocated to the participant's accounts under the plan on a daily basis based on the performance, positive or negative, of each specific measurement fund in which the participant's accounts are deemed to be invested. In the event no investment election is made by a participant, the participant's accounts under the plan are deemed to be invested in the lowest-risk measurement fund available under the plan and credited or debited with the earnings of such fund, until the participant elects otherwise. Only deferrals of a participant's bonus may be deemed invested in the common stock measurement fund available under the plan.  Any amounts deemed invested in the common stock measurement fund and any deferrals of restricted units or performance units may not be reallocated to any other investment measurement fund under the plan. Incentive units and amounts deemed invested in the common stock measurement fund are credited with dividend equivalent units as of each dividend payment date and deemed reinvested in additional common stock units based on the fair market value of the Company's stock on the dividend payment date.  If service and performance conditions are not met, the unit credits will be reversed.
Payments from the plan are payable upon the earlier of retirement, termination of employment, disability, death, or in the event of a scheduled distribution (payment during a specified year elected by the participant).  Distributions due to retirement may begin immediately or up to five years after retirement and may be made in a lump sum or in annual installments from two to 15 years. The time and method of retirement distributions are elected by each participant and, effective for 2015 and thereafter, may be separately elected on an annual basis with respect to amounts deferred and/or contributed on behalf of the participant for such year.  Distributions due to termination of employment of all amounts deferred or contributed to the plan on behalf of the participant prior to 2015 shall be distributed in a lump sum.  Effective 2015 and thereafter, each participant may separately elect on an annual basis the method in which amounts deferred or contributed on such participant's behalf for such year will be distributed in the event of a termination of employment.  Such distributions may be made in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period not to exceed three years.
Distributions due to death or disability and scheduled distributions may only be made in a lump sum.  Scheduled distributions may not be made with respect to any long-term awards deferred under the plan.  Distributions of incentive units and of funds held in the common stock measurement fund may only be made in common stock of the Company.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following table sets forth the amounts that would have been payable to each of our NEOs under the various scenarios for termination of employment or a change of control of the Company had such scenarios occurred on December 31, 2018. The price per share of Company stock that is used for purposes of the table is $34.65, the  Table of Contents closing market price as of December 28, 2018. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from the Company or the change of control. In addition to the amounts reflected in the table, upon termination of employment each of the NEOs would also receive benefits under the Hancock Whitney Corporation Pension Plan, as described above, as well as benefits under the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan, and for Mr. Exnicios only, benefits under the Whitney Holding Corporation Retirement Restoration Plan. Finally, the receipt of many of the payments and benefits listed in the table below are contingent upon the executive complying with certain covenants, which are described below.

 (1)  Amounts reported in this column assume each executive qualifies for normal retirement.  However, only Messrs. Hairston, Achary and Exnicios would actually qualify for vesting of benefits due to normal retirement under the Company's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan as of December 31, 2018, and none of the executives would qualify for vesting of long-term incentives due to retirement as of that date. Amounts reported for "Vesting of Long Term Incentives: RSA, PSA" assume the maximum number of performance shares that were granted in 2017 and 2018 will be earned during the performance period.  One-half of the 2017 and 2018 grants have a two-year performance period and one-half have a three-year performance period.  Two-thirds of the 2017 grants with a three-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked two-thirds of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  100 percent of the 2017 grants with a two-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked 100 percent of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  One-third of the 2018 grants with a three-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked one-third of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  One-half of the 2018 grants with a two-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked one-half of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  
 (2)  Amounts reported for "Vesting of Long Term Incentives: RSA, PSA" assume the target number of performance shares that were granted in 2017 and 2018 will be earned during the performance period.  One-half of the 2017 and 2018 grants have a two-year performance period and one-half have a three-year performance period.  Two-thirds of the 2017 grants with a three-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked two-thirds of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  100 percent of the 2017 grants with a two-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked 100 percent of the performance period as of December 31, 2018. One-third of the 2018 grants with a three-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked one-third of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  One-half of the 2018 grants with a two-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked one-half of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  In addition to the amounts reported, upon death, the beneficiaries of Messrs. Hairston, Achary, Loper and Exnicios would be entitled to a $25,000 BOLI death benefit.  These death benefits are payable by the contracted insurance carrier and not by the Company.

 (4)  Amounts reported for "Vesting of Long Term Incentives: RSA, PSA" assume restricted stock awards do not vest.  By their terms, these awards will not vest upon a change in control unless the Board of Directors exercises discretion to vest such awards as a result of the surviving entity choosing not to assume any obligations relating to the awards and choosing not to convert such awards into equivalent rights with respect to equity in the surviving entity.  If these awards had vested, the amounts reported would be as follows:  Hairston ($1,501,385), Achary ($543,566), Exnicios ($574,797), Loper ($569,207) and Knight ($639,050). Amounts reported for "Vesting of Long Term Incentives: RSA, PSA" assume the maximum number of performance shares that were granted in 2017 and 2018 will be earned during the performance period.  One-half of the 2017 and 2018 grants have a two-year performance period and one-half have a three-year performance period.  Two-thirds of the 2017 grants with a three-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked two-thirds of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  100 percent of the 2017 grants with a two-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked 100 percent of the performance period as of December 31, 2018. One-third of the 2018 grants with a three-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked one-third of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  One-half of the 2018 grants with a two-year performance period will vest because the executive has worked one-half of the performance period as of December 31, 2018.  For 2017 and 2018 grants, performance below the threshold level results in no performance shares being earned.  Performance at the threshold level results in 50% of the target number of shares being earned.  Performance at the target level results in 100% of the target number of shares being earned.  Performance at or above the maximum level results in 200% of the target number of shares being earned.  The number of performance shares earned is interpolated on a linear basis for performance levels between threshold and target, and for performance levels between target and maximum.

• Restricted stock awards vest only if the Board of Directors exercises its discretion to vest such awards as a result of the post-transaction surviving entity choosing not to assume any obligations relating to such awards and choosing not to convert such awards into equivalent rights with respect to equity in the post-transaction surviving entity; 
• Immediate vesting of a portion of performance share awards, with such vested portion determined based on progress toward established performance goals and the amount of time that has elapsed from the beginning of the performance period until the date of the change of control; and 
• Immediate vesting of any unvested amounts under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, but only to the extent such vesting does not cause the excise tax provisions of Code Section 4999 to be effective with respect to the executive. 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
One or more of the benefits listed above will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid excise taxes under Code Section 4999 if such reduction results in higher after-tax benefits to the executives than if such benefits are not reduced.
Disability, Involuntary Termination or Termination for Good Reason upon Change of Control
In the event of a disability, an involuntary termination, or a termination for good reason (defined below) of a NEO within two years following a change of control (defined below), in addition to any unpaid amounts previously earned during his term of employment, he would be entitled to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Immediate vesting (at the time of the change of control) of amounts indicated above under Change of Control Only, with subsequent vesting (at the time of the executive's disability or termination of employment) of any restricted stock awards that did not vest at the time of the change of control; 
• Mr. Hairston would be entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to three times his base salary and average annual bonus (for the three most recent fiscal years); and Messrs.

• Mr. Hairston would be entitled to up to 36 months of medical insurance continuation. Messrs. Achary, Exnicios, Loper and Knight would be entitled to up to 24 months of medical insurance continuation.  Coverage would be provided at the same level of benefits as in effect at the time of the executive's disability or termination of employment, and on the same cost sharing basis as in effect for active executives in comparable positions.  Coverage would cease upon the executive becoming eligible for similar coverage provided by another employer.  
[END TABLE]
One or more of the benefits listed above will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid excise taxes under Code Section 4999 if such reduction results in higher after-tax benefits to the executives than if such benefits are not reduced.
Termination in Connection with a Reduction in Force
In the event of a termination of a NEO in connection with a reduction in force, in addition to any unpaid amounts previously earned during his term of employment, he would receive pro-rated vesting of previously granted restricted stock awards under the 2017 and 2018 grants based on the number of months elapsed since grant.
Definition of Change of Control
Generally, a change of control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events as to the Company:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
For purposes of the above, "persons acting as a group" shall have the meaning as in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B). Table of Contents
Definition of Good Reason
"Good Reason" shall generally mean any of the following occurring without the executive's consent:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material diminution in the executive's position, authority, duties or responsibilities from those which the executive held immediately prior to the effective date of the change of control;

PROPOSAL NO. 2
ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, we are seeking shareholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to SEC rules (the say-on-pay proposal).  In your consideration of how to vote on this proposal, we encourage you to review all the relevant information in this proxy statement – our CD&A (including its executive summary), the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative disclosures and footnotes regarding our executive compensation program.  Shareholders are asked to vote, on an advisory basis, to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for the Company's 2019 annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.
We understand that executive compensation is an important matter for our shareholders. Our core executive compensation philosophy and practice continue to be based on pay for performance, and we believe that our compensation program is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders.  
While this say-on-pay proposal is advisory only and the voting results are not binding, our Compensation Committee and Board will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers.  It is our current policy to provide you this advisory voting opportunity annually.  Accordingly, you will have the opportunity to vote on whether to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs again at our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders.
We invite shareholders who wish to communicate with our Board on executive compensation or any other matters to contact us as provided under "Shareholder Communications" below.  
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. Table of Contents
Transactions with Related Persons
The Company, through the Bank, has made, and expects to make in the future, loans in the ordinary course of business to directors and officers of the Company and the Bank, members of their immediate families and their associates.  The Bank has made such loans on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Company.  At the time made, no such loans involved more than the normal risk of collectability or presented other unfavorable features that require disclosure in the proxy statement.
The Bank employs several relatives of directors and executive officers, including two employees who were paid or otherwise earned compensation exceeding $120,000 in the aggregate during 2018.  These employees also received benefits under certain employee benefit plans that are generally available to all similarly situated Bank employees.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Taylor R. Backstrom, the son of Robert Roseberry, one of our directors, is employed by the Bank as a Commercial Banker.  During 2018, Taylor Backstrom received total cash compensation of $145,544.  Mr. Backstrom received stock awards valued at $9,981 (which will not fully vest until 2023). He also received benefits valued at $11,946. These benefits include matching contributions to the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan, restricted stock dividends and a change in retirement pension plan value. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Jay R. Exnicios, the brother of Joseph S. Exnicios, one of our executive officers and President of the Bank, is employed by the Bank as a Corporate Banker. During 2018, Jay Exnicios received total cash compensation of $277,466. Mr. Exnicios received stock awards valued at $30,216 (which will not fully vest until 2023).  He also received benefits valued at $7,654. These benefits include matching contributions to the Hancock Whitney 401(k) plan, restricted stock dividends and a change in retirement pension plan value. 
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that we review all transactions that may be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K (Related Party Transactions) for potential conflicts of interest.  Generally, the Audit Committee will be responsible for reviewing and approving all Related Party Transactions.
The Company provides brokerage services and investment advisory services and offers annuities and insurance products through its subsidiary Hancock Whitney Investment Services, Inc. (HWIS).  It conducts virtually all of its other business activities through the Bank, or through the Bank's subsidiaries, and those business activities primarily consist of offering deposit accounts, making loans, and engaging in trust business. While Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits a public company from extending or renewing credit or arranging the extension or renewal of credit to an officer or director, this prohibition does not apply to loans made by depository institutions such as banks that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to the insider lending restrictions of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O.  Accordingly, we permit our directors and executive officers, their family members and their related interests, to establish and maintain banking and business relationships in the ordinary course of business with the Bank and HWIS. With respect to lending activities, the Bank has a special written policy governing affiliate and insider lending transactions.  This policy prohibits extensions of credit to insiders, as defined in the policies, unless the extension of credit:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as, and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the Bank with members of the general public; and  
• does not involve more than the normal degree of risk or other unfavorable factors.  
[END TABLE]
Audit Committee review is required for any lending transaction that alone or together with other extensions of credit to an "insider" exceeds $120,000 and does not meet the criteria noted above or which becomes a past due, nonaccrual, restructured or a potential problem loan as of year-end under applicable SEC rules.  Also, in compliance with Regulation O, a majority of the board of directors of the bank extending credit must approve in advance any extension of credit to any director or executive officer or any of their related interests where the aggregate lending relationship exceeds $500,000.  A director with an interest in the extension of credit must abstain from voting or participating in the discussion and approval of the extension of credit.  Table of Contents
In accordance with Regulation O, additional restrictions are imposed on extensions of credit to any executive officer.  The Bank may make extensions of credit to an executive officer: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in any amount to finance the education of his or her children;  
• in any amount to finance or refinance the purchase, construction or renovation of a residence when secured by a first lien on the residence;  
• in any amount provided that the extension of credit is secured by U.S. Government obligations, which is the subject of an unconditional takeout commitment or guarantee by a U.S. Government entity, or a perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account of the Bank; or  
• for any other purpose if the aggregate amount of loans (excluding loans for education and residence) does not exceed $100,000.  
[END TABLE]
An extension of credit covered by Regulation O to executive officers must be (1) promptly reported to the board of directors of the bank extending such credit; (2) preceded by the submission of a detailed personal financial statement; and (3) made subject to the written provision (in the promissory note or allonge thereto) that the loan will, at the option of the bank, be due and payable at any time that the executive officer is indebted to any other bank or banks in an amount greater than the dollar thresholds set forth above. 
In order to promote compliance with applicable laws, regulations and rules pertaining to insider lending transactions discussed above, the Company has appointed an officer (the Regulation O Monitoring Officer) to assist Bank employees in identifying and reviewing pertinent transactions with identified insiders. The Regulation O Monitoring Officer annually receives lists of all directors and executive officers of the Company and the Bank from our Corporate Secretary, as well as a list of our principal shareholders, if any.  The information collected from directors and designated executive officers includes the names of these individuals and their family members, as well as the names of their related interests.  This information is compiled based on questionnaires our directors and designated executive officers submit to the Corporate Secretary.  Information available from public databases and the Bank's records supplement the data. The Bank's Regulation O Monitoring Officer directly compiles information regarding other insiders designated by the Board of Directors as subject to Regulation O, their family members and related interests. The Bank's officers managing proposed extensions of credit to insiders are responsible for confirming that the proposed extensions of credit are in compliance with the Bank's policies on insider transactions.  The Regulation O Monitoring Officer will promptly notify our Corporate Secretary in the event the Regulation O Monitoring Officer detects an extension of credit to an insider that appears to violate the policy. 
The Corporate Secretary follows procedures to help us determine at the end of each year whether any insider relationship or transaction has occurred that must be disclosed pursuant to the SEC's rules regarding Related Party Transactions or that might impair a non-employee director's independence under SEC rules or NASDAQ listing rules.  These procedures include annual director and executive officer questionnaires, a survey of customer databases of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as a review of other records, including accounts payable, payroll and real estate transaction records.  The Corporate Secretary reports any insider transactions so discovered to the Audit Committee for review, approval or ratification and reports other matters that would disqualify a non-employee director from meeting NASDAQ or SEC independence requirements to the Board.
To further raise awareness regarding, and to ensure the proper handling of, insider transactions, we have adopted various codes of conduct, including the Code of Business Ethics for Officers and Associates, the Code of Ethics for Financial Officers, and the Code of Ethics for Directors. These codes, which are available on the Governance Documents page of the Investor Relations website at www.hancockwhitney.com/investors, promote the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, and encourage covered persons to seek advice to avoid conflicts of interest.  Employees are also prohibited from handling any customer relationship involving themselves, their relatives or affiliated businesses.  Our Audit Committee is responsible for applying and interpreting the codes pertaining to senior financial officers, executive officers and directors, and shall report any violations to the Board for further action.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Company's Audit Committee selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for 2018. As part of its role in overseeing the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that on an annual basis the Audit Committee pre-approve the general engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm to provide defined audit, audit-related and possible tax services within pre-approved fee levels.  Unless otherwise provided, such pre-approvals shall remain in effect for 12 months.  The Audit Committee may revise the list of generally pre-approved services from time to time.  The Audit Committee may also grant general pre-approval for other permissible non-audit services classified as all other services, provided that such services would not impair the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.  Pre-approval may be granted by action of the full Audit Committee or, in the absence of such action, the Audit Committee Chair or his designee may pre-approve individual engagements up to a limit of $100,000. Any pre-approval granted by less than the full Audit Committee must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.  The Audit Committee will consult the SEC's rules and relevant guidance in applying this policy.  During 2018, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services provided by PwC.
Fees and Related Disclosures for Accounting Services
The Audit Committee pre-approved all professional services provided by PwC and the related fees in 2018 and 2017. The following table discloses the fees for professional services provided by PwC in each of the last two fiscal years to the Company and its subsidiaries:

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes and has a key role in the oversight and supervision of PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's role includes sole authority to: (1) appoint or replace the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; (2) pre-approve all audit or permissible non-audit services that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm performs on behalf of the Company; and (3) approve compensation related to all auditing services and any permissible non-audit services. The Audit Committee monitors management's evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and retains and monitors the activities of PwC. The Audit Committee also oversees the Company's procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints the Company receives regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. For greater detail regarding the functions and responsibilities of the Audit Committee, please refer to the Audit  Table of Contents
Committee Charter, which is available on the Company's Investor Relations website under www.hancockwhitney.com/investors under Corporate Overview – Committee Charting. The Audit Committee is in compliance with the Audit Committee Charter. 
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting processes, including the system of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). 
The Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements with the independent registered public accounting firm who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those statements with GAAP and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be communicated by Auditing Standard 1301, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in (AS 1301). The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's Internal Auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met with the Internal Auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to discuss the results of audits, evaluations of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. Both the Internal Auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee held two executive sessions with its independent accountants in 2018. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books of the Company and its subsidiaries for 2019, subject to ratification by a majority of the shares represented at the annual meeting.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements and to attest to the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and until their successors are selected. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served continuously as the Company's auditor since 2009. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is a registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules of the PCAOB.
The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of the Company's independent auditor, both in fact and appearance. In order to ensure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent auditor. In addition, the Audit Committee recognizes that restrictions exist as to the hiring of any current or former partner, principal,  Table of Contents shareholder or professional employee of its independent auditor and has reasonable measures in place to ensure any such potential candidates are reviewed prior to hiring for compliance with such restrictions. The Audit Committee also requires the lead PricewaterhouseCoopers partner assigned to the Company's audit to be rotated at least every five years. The Audit Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of the new lead partner.
Each year, the Audit Committee evaluates the qualification, performance and independence of the Company's independent auditor and determines whether to re-engage the current independent auditor for the following year.  In doing so, the Audit Committee considers, among other things: (i) external data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on PricewaterhouseCoopers and its peer firms; (ii) PricewaterhouseCoopers' tenure as our independent auditor and its familiarity with our operations and business, accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial reporting; (iii) the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditors, the auditors' capabilities and expertise; (iv) whether the firm or any of its partners has any direct or any material indirect financial interest in the securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except as auditors and consultants on accounting procedures and tax matters; and (v) PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence.  Based on this evaluation, the members of the Audit Committee and the Company's Board believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Board anticipates that representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be in attendance at the annual meeting and will be available to respond to questions. 
Although not required to do so, the Company's Board has chosen to submit its selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for ratification by the Company's shareholders.  It is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote such proxy FOR the ratification of this selection.  If this proposal does not pass, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection. The proposal will be ratified if the votes cast favoring the appointment exceed the votes cast opposing it.  Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO AUDIT THE BOOKS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR 2019.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS
The Board provides a process for shareholders to send communications to the Board or to individual directors.

APPENDIX A
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Operating Revenue and Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue, and Operating Earnings and Earnings Per Share (Operating EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures that excludes income or expense considered to be nonoperating in nature. Items identified as nonoperating are those that, when excluded from a reported financial measure, provide management or the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in the Company's business. Operating Revenue and Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue are presented on a taxable equivalent (te) basis to adjust for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments using the statutory federal tax rate. Operating Revenue is defined as net interest income (te) and noninterest income less nonoperating income. Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue is defined as operating revenue less noninterest expense, excluding nonoperating items. Management believes these are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to gain a better understanding of the Company's performance period over period, as well as measure management's success in executing its strategic initiatives. Operating pre-provision net revenue is also a useful financial measure to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Operating Earnings are reported net income excluding nonoperating items net of income tax. Operating Earnings per Share is defined as operating earnings expressed as an amount available to each common shareholder on a diluted basis.
A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures is presented in the tables below:
