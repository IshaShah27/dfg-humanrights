A shareholder has notified CMS of his intent to propose a resolution at the Annual Meeting that, if approved, would, among other things, request that CMS publish a report of actually     incurred corporate costs and associated actual and significant benefits accruing to shareholders and the climate from the company's climate-related activities that are voluntary and exceed government regulatory requirements. This shareholder proposal     is referred to as the "Floor Proposal" and was not submitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and the shareholder did not seek to have the Floor Proposal included in this Proxy Statement.

Proxy Statement
While CMS and Consumers are established, operated and regulated as separate legal entities, CMS and Consumers have the same individuals serve as members on each       Board of Directors and each Board Committee and have adopted coordinated director and executive compensation arrangements and plans as well as auditing relationships. The two companies also have significant overlap in executive management. Although       in certain contexts in this Proxy Statement the terms "we" and "our" refer to each of CMS and Consumers and satisfy their respective disclosure obligations, this Combined Proxy Statement is separately filed by CMS and Consumers. Information in     this Combined Proxy Statement relating to each individual registrant is filed by such registrant on its own behalf. Unless specifically noted, singular references to "Board," "Committee," "Corporation," and "Annual Meeting"       refers to both CMS and Consumers. 
Proposal 1:
Elect the Director Nominees Named in this Proxy Statement to the Board of Directors
There are 11 nominees for election as directors of CMS and Consumers, to hold office until the next annual meeting and until       their successors are elected and qualified. The Board believes that the nominees will be available to serve, but in the event any nominee is unable to do so, the proxies will be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board or the number of       directors constituting the full Board will be reduced accordingly.
All of the nominees are currently serving as Directors. All eleven nominees have accepted their nomination and agree to serve if elected. Suzanne F. Shank was               appointed to the Boards in January 2019, but was not previously elected by shareholders. Stephen E. Ewing has reached the retirement age of 75, as stated in our Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Principles       ("Principles"). However, in light of his experience, skills, qualifications and core competencies as well as the Board's current needs, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to have     Director Ewing re-elected and serve until the next annual meeting.
The following table identifies the balance of experience, skills and qualifications that the nominees bring to the Board. The skills and qualifications that are marked below     are reviewed by the Governance, Sustainability and Public Responsibility Committee ("Governance Committee") and the Board when making nomination decisions and reviewing Board succession planning and the fact that a particular skill or qualification is     not designated does not mean nominees do not also possess the specific experience and qualifications. The table below illustrates how the Board is well-positioned to provide direction and oversight with respect to our overall performance, strategic     direction and significant corporate policies.

Corporate Governance
Governance Guidelines and Materials
The Board and management review and monitor governance trends and best practices on an ongoing basis. The Board has adopted Principles that reflect corporate and Board     practices as well as Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards. The Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing our Principles at least annually and recommending any     proposed changes to the Board for approval. The Principles intend to serve as a flexible framework within which the Board and its Committees operate. Except for the Executive Committee, the Board has adopted charters for each of the standing Committees     that detail their purposes, duties and authority, composition, meetings and resources as well as other aspects of Committee activities ("Charters"), which are further described under Board and Committee Information below. Each Committee     reviews its Charter annually and recommends changes to the Governance Committee for review and recommendation to the Board for approval.
The current version of our Principles, Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"), Charters, Employee and Director Codes of Conduct ("Codes") and other corporate governance     materials are available at www.cmsenergy.com/corporategovernance.
Board of Directors
The Board provides direction and oversight with respect to our overall performance, strategic direction and significant corporate policies. The Board approves major     initiatives, advises on key financial and business objectives, and monitors progress with respect to these matters. Directors are kept informed of our business by various reports and documents provided to them on a regular basis, including operating     and financial reports made at Board and Committee meetings. The Board has full and direct access to all members of management and may hire consultants and advisors as deemed necessary.
Board Leadership Structure
As stated in our Principles, the Board has determined that for the present time, it is in the best interests of the Corporation and shareholders to keep the offices of Chief     Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chairman separate to enhance oversight responsibilities. The Board believes that this leadership structure promotes independent and effective oversight of management on key issues relating to long-range business plans,     long-range strategic issues and risks. To further promote independent and effective oversight of management, our Principles also provide that at any time when the Chairman is not considered independent under NYSE listing standards, a Presiding Director     will be chosen by the independent directors to coordinate the activities and preside at the executive sessions attended only by the independent members of the Board. The Presiding Director provides the independent directors with a key means for     collaboration and communication. Under our Bylaws, the Presiding Director will: (1) convene and chair meetings of the independent directors in executive session no less than once each year; (2) preside at meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of     the Board is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors; (3) solicit independent directors for advice on agenda items for meetings of the Board; (4) serve as a liaison between the Chairman of the Board, the President and the     independent directors; and (5) perform such other duties as may be assigned by the Board from time to time. Russell, the current Chairman, is not a member of management, but as former CEO he is not considered independent under NYSE listing standards;     therefore, on May 4, 2018, Harvey was re-elected as Presiding Director for the Board for a one-year term.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Risk Oversight
The Board's risk oversight process includes regular reports from senior management on areas of material operational, legal, regulatory, financial, strategic, compliance,     environmental, liability, safety, information technology, cybersecurity and reputational risk. The Board receives an annual risk management review from the Executive Director of Risk in addition to the risk oversight functions performed by the various     Committees of the Board. These include: (1) a review by the Audit Committee of the risks associated with operating and financial activities which could impact its financial and other disclosure reporting, as well as a review of policies on risk     assessment, controls and accounting risk exposure; (2) the Audit Committee's review and approval of risk management policies; (3) a review by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee ("Compensation Committee") of the potential risks associated     with the Corporation's executive compensation policies and practices; and (4) the Compensation Committee's review of management's assessment of the likelihood that the incentive compensation plans will have a material adverse impact.
Cybersecurity Oversight
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Corporation's cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity risks are included in the risk reports to the Audit Committee discussed above. The     Audit Committee receives cybersecurity updates that focus on our most critical assets, cybersecurity drills, exercises, mitigation of cybersecurity risks and assessments by third-party experts.
Political Contribution Oversight
The Board oversees our political engagement policies, programs and practices. The Governance Committee is also responsible for advising and assisting the Board with respect to     our political engagement.  Our policies, including the governance and decision-making process for corporate political contributions, are described in detail at https://www.cmsenergy.com/corporate-governance/political-engagement. We believe Board     oversight of our political activity along with the Board's alignment with our current disclosure standards provide the necessary accountability to ensure that political activities are conducted in the best interest of customers, shareholders and other     stakeholders. Through Board oversight, we have maintained a rigorous compliance process to ensure that its political activities are lawful, properly disclosed and align with our Codes.
Public Responsibility and Sustainability Oversight
The Board oversees our public responsibility and sustainability practices. The Governance Committee is also responsible for advising and assisting the Board with respect to     our public responsibility and sustainability matters. We are committed to corporate responsibility through our business, culture, environment and our communities – past, present and future. We conduct business safely and ethically to preserve the     environment and sustain our communities while serving our customers across the state of Michigan. This aligns with our purpose, which is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. We measure our progress towards this purpose     by considering our impact on the "triple bottom line" of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that we create, but also our responsibility to social and     environmental goals.
The planet element of the triple bottom line represents our commitment to protect the environment, which extends beyond complying with the various state and federal laws and     regulations.
We are committed to caring for the environment as part of our strategic direction. Some of our environmental and sustainability achievements include the following:
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our environmental leadership has received recognition by third parties, including the following in 2018: 
We provide extensive public reporting and are forthcoming in disclosures about our environmental stewardship and long-term strategy. We address issues related to climate     change in SEC, Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agency filings, and by voluntarily reporting our climate risk strategy and related data to CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project). We also publish an annual     Sustainability Report and in 2018, we completed the EEI ESG & Sustainability Report and published our first Climate Assessment Report, which addresses the long-term implications of our electric supply fuel mix and capital expenditure plans.
We continually update and enhance disclosures relating to our sustainability efforts. These disclosures and updates can be found on our website at     https://www.cmsenergy.com/environment.
We have created a cleaner, more sustainable energy future by taking a leadership position in reducing air emissions and water usage, saving landfill space and boosting the     amount of renewable energy supplied to customers. We have also provided, and intend to continue providing, appropriate disclosures to our shareholders regarding climate change and the risks it poses.
Shareholder Engagement
As part of our overall corporate governance, we have an on-going outreach program to develop and maintain communication with our investors in regard to governance and     compensation issues. We value these discussions and the Board considers pertinent feedback when evaluating corporate governance and compensation issues. In addition, management regularly participates in investor and industry conferences throughout the     year to discuss performance, environmental, social and governance topics, and share its perspective on business and industry developments. Shareholders may also contact the Board with any inquiry or issue, by the methods described below and the Board     will respond as appropriate.
Board Communication Process
Interested parties, including shareholders, employees or third parties can communicate with the Board, Committee, the independent directors as a group, or an individual     director, including the Chairman, by sending written communications to the Corporate Secretary, One Energy Plaza, Jackson, Michigan 49201. Envelopes should be clearly marked "Board Communication" or "Director Communication."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Corporate Secretary will review and forward, as appropriate, such correspondence in order to facilitate communications with the Board or its Committees, the independent     directors or individual members.
Any shareholder, employee or third party who wishes to submit a compliance concern to the Board or applicable Committees, including complaints regarding accounting, internal     accounting controls or auditing matters to the Audit Committee, may do so by any of the following means:
All such communications will be reviewed by the Chief Compliance Officer (who reports directly to the Audit Committee) prior to being forwarded to the Board or applicable     Committees or directors, as appropriate.
Identification of Director Candidates
The Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating director candidates, seeking candidates to serve on the Board       consistent with criteria approved by the Board, and recommending a slate of candidates for election at the Annual Meeting. There are numerous steps in identifying director candidates. 
The Governance Committee will consider shareholder-recommended director nominees in accordance with the requirements of our Bylaws. The information that must be included and     the procedures that must be followed by a shareholder wishing to recommend a director candidate for the Board's consideration are the same as would be required under our Bylaws if the shareholder wished to nominate that candidate directly. The     Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders on the same basis that the Governance Committee evaluates other nominees for director.
CMS Bylaws also permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, who have owned,
TABLE OF CONTENTS
continuously for at least three years, at least three percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation to submit director nominees (not greater than two or     20% of the Board) for inclusion in its proxy statement if the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the CMS Bylaws.
A director nomination that is not submitted for inclusion in the proxy statement but instead is sought to be presented directly at the Annual Meeting, must comply with the     advance notice provisions in our Bylaws.
Any recommendation or nomination submitted by a shareholder regarding a director candidate must be submitted within the time frame provided in our Bylaws for director     nominations and must include (a) a statement from the proposed nominee that he or she has consented to the submission of the recommendation or nomination and (b) such other information about the proposed nominee(s) and/or nominating shareholder(s) as     is required by our Bylaws.
Written notice must be sent to the Corporate Secretary, One Energy Plaza, Jackson, Michigan 49201. You may access our Bylaws at www.cmsenergy.com/corporategovernance.
Director Candidate Qualifications
Director candidates are sought whose particular background, experiences and qualities meet the needs of the Board. The Board values high standards of integrity, business     ethics and sound judgment, which add value, perspective and expertise to the Board's deliberations. The Governance Committee assesses, on a regular basis, the qualifications needed by the Board in light of the Board's current composition and recommends     changes to the Board when appropriate; and determines from time to time other criteria for selection and retention of Board members. The Governance Committee has not established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by director     candidates or identified any specific qualities or skills that the directors must possess. Although the Governance Committee has not established a formal policy on diversity, it has adopted, as a general guideline, that the Board will include a broad     spectrum of diverse business, political, academic, demographic and social interests. The Governance Committee takes a wide range of factors into account in evaluating the suitability of director candidates, including experience in business, leadership,     regulated utility, sustainability and environment, risk management, customer experience, safety, governance, accounting, finance, legal, information technology, lean practices, and compensation and human resources, which will bring a diversity of     thought, perspective, approach and opinion to the Board. The Governance Committee does not have a single method for identifying director candidates but will consider candidates suggested by a wide range of sources. Shank is standing for election by the     shareholders for the first time at this Annual Meeting. Shank was initially identified as a potential nominee by an officer and recommended for nomination by the Governance Committee. Shank was elected to the Board effective January 18, 2019. Shank is     the only director nominee for the Annual Meeting who is standing for election by the shareholders for the first time.
Director Tenure
The Board believes that diversity in tenure adds value, perspective and expertise to the Board's deliberations, with longer-tenured directors bringing a deep understanding of     the Corporation and shorter-tenured directors bringing a fresh perspective. Over the past seven years, the Board has added seven new directors. Director term limits, included in our Principles, state that Directors (other than the CEO) first elected     after January 2017, may not serve on the Board for more than 15 years and Committee chairs (other than the Executive Committee) may not serve in such role for more than five years. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director Independence
Directors Barfield, Butler, Darrow, Ewing, Harvey, Shank, Soto, Sznewajs, and Wright are "independent" and Director Philip R. Lochner, Jr. who retired in 2018 was independent,     as determined by the Board, in accordance with the NYSE listing standards, applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, our more stringent Independence Standards, as set forth in our Principles, and taking into consideration all business relationships     between the Corporation and its subsidiaries and each non-employee director. Russell is not independent because he has been an employee of the Corporation within the last three years. Poppe is not independent due to her employment relationship with the     Corporation.
The Board identified the following relationships which were deemed immaterial to such Directors' independence:
In addition, the Board has affirmatively determined that each member of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee is independent under NYSE listing standards, rules and     regulations of the SEC and, if applicable, the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). Furthermore, the Board has determined that the ability of our Audit Committee members to serve on our Audit Committee is not impaired by service on other audit committees.
The Independence Standards, adopted by the Board as part of our Principles, can be found at www.cmsenergy.com/corporategovernance.
CMS Majority Voting Standard
Under the CMS Articles of Incorporation, CMS Bylaws and our Principles, any director nominee who receives less than a majority of the votes cast by the CMS shareholders at a     regular election shall promptly tender his or her resignation. For this purpose, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director, not counting     abstentions. Upon receipt of such a tendered resignation, the CMS Governance Committee shall consider and recommend to the CMS Board whether or not to accept the resignation. The CMS Board will act on the CMS Governance Committee's recommendation     within 90 days following certification of our shareholder vote, and contemporaneously with that action will cause CMS to publicly disclose the CMS Board's decision whether to accept or decline such director's resignation offer (and the reasons for     rejecting the resignation offer, if appropriate). The director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the standard will not be involved in either the CMS Governance Committee's recommendation or the CMS Board's decision to accept or decline the     resignation. Due to complications that arise in the event of a contested election of directors, this standard would not apply in that context, and the underlying plurality vote requirement of Michigan law would control any contested director elections.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director Education
Board members are expected to attend at least one continuing education program annually, sponsored by a recognized utility industry or corporate governance organization. All     Director nominees, except one, serving in 2018, attended at least one continuing education program in 2018. Also, we have an internal director education program. The internal program includes corporate and industry information disseminated through     orientation programs, business training modules and reports and operational site visits.
Board, Committee and Director Evaluations
The Board is committed to continuous self-improvement, and Board and Committee evaluations are an important tool for promoting effectiveness. The Board conducts a performance     evaluation annually and periodically engages a third party to conduct individual Director peer evaluations. The Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chairman, oversees the Board, Committee and Director evaluation processes.
Board and Committee evaluations are conducted for the Board and each standing Committee. Each Director participates in the process by completing a questionnaire that reviews     the previous year's performance. The questionnaire assesses, among other items, Board: 1) effectiveness, 2) meeting procedures, 3) operations, 4) composition, 5) accountability, and 6) future challenges. Directors may choose to provide their feedback     anonymously. The Directors then discuss the evaluation results in executive session. Policies and practices are then updated to address feedback, as appropriate.
Director peer evaluations provide Directors an opportunity to evaluate each other and identify opportunities for their own growth and development. Peer evaluations and     development follow-ups are facilitated by an independent third party and include confidential, open-ended, one-on-one interviews with each Director. The Board has conducted these periodic peer evaluations since 2008. The latest Director peer evaluation     cycle began in 2018.
Board and Committee Information
The CMS and Consumers Board each met nine times during 2018. Our Principles state the expectation that each Director will attend all scheduled Board and Committee meetings of     which he or she is a member, as well as the Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders. All Directors serving during 2018 attended more than 75% of the Board and assigned Committee meetings. Overall, the Directors attended 99% of the Board and     assigned Committee meetings. The then-current Board members, except one, attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
The Board has five standing Committees including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, an Executive Committee, a Finance Committee and a Governance Committee. The     members and the responsibilities of the standing Committees of the Boards are listed below. Other than the Executive Committee, of which Russell serves as Chair, each Committee is composed entirely of "independent" Directors, as that term is defined by     the NYSE listing standards and our Principles described above. Committees may also invite members of management or others to attend their meetings as they determine appropriate. Poppe and Russell routinely attend committee meetings.
On a regularly-scheduled basis, the non-employee Directors meet in executive session (that is, with no employee Directors present) and may invite such members of management to     attend as they determine appropriate. At least once each year, the independent Directors meet in executive session in conformance with the NYSE listing standards. In 2018, the CMS independent Directors met three times and the Consumers independent     Directors met three times. In 2018, Presiding Director Harvey presided over the executive sessions of independent Directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Compensation Risk
Management annually undertakes a comprehensive review of the compensation policies and practices throughout the organization in order to assess the risks presented by such     policies and practices.
Following this year's review, we have determined that such policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect. Management's analysis and     determination were reported to and reviewed by the Compensation Committee.
Codes of Ethics
We have adopted an employee code of ethics, titled "CMS Energy 2019 Code of Conduct and Guide to Ethical Business Behavior" ("Employees' Code") that applies to the CEO, Chief     Financial Officer ("CFO") and Chief Accounting Officer ("CAO"), as well as all other officers and employees of CMS and Consumers. CMS and Consumers have also adopted a director code of ethics titled "2019 Board of Directors Code of Conduct"     ("Directors' Code") that applies to the members of the Board. The Governance Committee annually reviews the Codes and recommends changes to the Board, as appropriate. The Employees' Code is administered by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports     directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees compliance with the Codes. Any alleged violation of the Directors' Code will be investigated by disinterested members of the Audit Committee, or if none, by disinterested members of the     Board. The Governance Committee would recommend appropriate action to the Board in the event a determination is made that a director violated the Directors' Code. The Codes and any waivers of, or amendments or exceptions to, a provision of the     Employees' Code that applies to the CEO, CFO, CAO or persons performing similar functions and any waivers of, or exceptions to, a provision of our Directors' Code will be disclosed on our website at www.cmsenergy.com/complianceandethics. No such     waivers or exceptions have been granted. 
Related Party Transactions
CMS, Consumers or their subsidiaries may occasionally enter into transactions with related parties. "Related Parties" include directors or executive officers, beneficial     owners of more than 5% of our common stock, family members of such persons, and entities in which such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. As set forth in our Codes, we consider a related party transaction to have occurred when a     Related Party enters into a transaction in which we are participating, the transaction amount is more than $10,000 and the Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest ("Related Party Transaction"). Any Related Party     Transaction must be reported to us.
In accordance with our Codes and the Audit Committee Charter, Related Party Transactions must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. In drawing its conclusion on any approval     request, the Audit Committee considers the following factors:
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The policies and procedures relating to the Audit Committee's approval of Related Party Transactions are found in the Codes, which are available at     www.cmsenergy.com/complianceandethics.
Since January 1, 2018, there have been no Related Party Transactions to report.
No Pledging or Hedging
In accordance with our Codes, CMS' and Consumers' officers, employees and directors may not engage in pledging or purchasing on margin our securities, "trading" of our     securities or selling "short" our securities or buying or selling puts or calls, hedges or other derivative securities relating to our securities, including compensatory awards of equity securities or our securities otherwise held, directly or     indirectly, by those persons. For purposes of these Codes, "trading" means a combination or pattern of substantial or continuous buying and selling of securities with the primary objective of realizing short-term gains. Selling "short" is a technique     in which investors bet on a stock price falling by selling securities they do not own with the understanding that they will buy them back, hopefully at a lower price.
Management Succession Planning
The Board engages in an active succession planning process. The Board selects a CEO and then consults with the CEO concerning the selection of a senior management team and     plans for their succession. The management succession plan also includes provisions for CEO succession. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews succession planning issues and reports to the Board. The Compensation Committee also advises the Board     on succession planning, including policies and principles for executive officer selection. CEO evaluations are conducted annually.
CEO Pay Ratio
It is the philosophy of CMS and Consumers to provide market-based compensation tied to performance.  An employee's compensation is based on a combination of the market value     of his or her position along with individual experience and performance.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the median of the annual total compensation of all CMS employees (other than Poppe, President and CEO), was $106,125; and the     annual total compensation of Poppe was $8,091,185. Based on this information the ratio of the annual total compensation of the President and CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all CMS employees was 76.2 to 1.

In determining the median employee for each of CMS and Consumers, our calculation includes employees as of December 31, 2018, as follows:
All employees are U.S.-based with 96% of our employee population in Michigan. Total compensation for purposes of determining the median employee is illustrated below by pay     element. We identified each of CMS' and Consumers' median employees using these compensation measures, which were consistently applied to all employees.
The pay elements that were included in the annual total compensation to identify the median employee are:
Once the annual total compensation was calculated for each employee using the above measures, the annual total compensation of all employees was ranked except for the     President and CEO from lowest to highest, and the median employee was identified.
Once the median employee was determined, the median employee's compensation for fiscal year 2018

Narrative to 2018 Directors' Compensation Table
Non-employee director compensation is benchmarked annually. Directors who are CMS or Consumers employees do not receive retainers or fees for service on the Board or as a     member of any Committee. Non-employee directors receive an annual retainer fee and restricted stock award for service on the CMS and Consumers Boards and additional annual retainer fees for certain Committee positions. Directors are reimbursed for     expenses incurred in attending Board or Committee meetings and other company business.
In 2018, directors who were not CMS or Consumers employees each received an annual cash retainer fee. The following table describes the annual cash retainer fee received for     service in 2018 and the annual cash retainer fee that will be received for service in 2019, as well as other fees for Director services. Annual retainer fees are paid based on the number of months served on the Board in each respective capacity.

In May 2018, all then-serving non-employee directors, were awarded a number of shares of restricted stock with a fair market value at the time of award of $130,000. These     shares of restricted stock are 100% tenure-based and vest 100% at the next annual meeting date. In 2019, the annual restricted stock award will have a fair market value at the time of the May 2019 award of approximately $150,000, an increase of $20,000     from 2018. These shares of restricted stock will be 100% tenure-based and vest at the next annual meeting date. Under our Performance Incentive Stock Plan, non-employee directors may defer receipt of their annual equity awards until a deferral date     selected by the director. If a deferral election is made by the director, the equity awards subject to the deferral election will be granted as restricted stock units rather than restricted stock awards. Directors Butler, Darrow, Soto, and Sznewajs     elected to defer equity in 2018.
Stock ownership guidelines have been adopted by the Board that align further the interests of the directors with our shareholders. Directors are required to hold CMS common     stock equivalent in value to five times their annual cash retainer by the end of the fifth calendar year of becoming a director. In the event a director has not met the stock ownership guidelines in the prescribed time frame, in lieu of the director     receiving his or her monthly cash retainer, the retainer will be used to purchase CMS common stock until such time as the guideline has been met. All directors currently comply with this stock ownership requirement or are currently expected to comply     by the end of their fifth calendar year of becoming a director.
Pursuant to the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP"), a director who is not an employee may, at any time prior to a calendar year in which cash retainer fees are to     be earned, irrevocably elect to defer payment, through written notice, of all or a portion of any of the cash retainer fees that would otherwise be paid to the director. Deferred amounts will be distributed in a lump sum or in annual installments in     cash, as specified in the director's initial election. Fidelity Investments, an independent record keeper, administers the DCP. The participant decides how contributions are invested among a broad array of mutual funds selected by and provided by the     record keeper. Funds equal to the amounts deferred are transferred to Fidelity Investments. Our payment obligations to the directors remain an unsecured contractual right to a payment. Directors Barfield, Butler, Darrow, Soto, and Sznewajs participated     in the DCP in 2018.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
In this section, we describe and discuss our executive compensation program, including its objectives and elements, as well as determinations made by the Compensation Committee regarding     the compensation of the CEO, CFO and the three other most highly compensated executive officers of each of CMS and Consumers, who we collectively refer to as the "named executive officers" ("NEOs"). As of December 31, 2018, the NEOs for each of CMS and     Consumers are Patricia Poppe (President and CEO), Rejji Hayes (Executive Vice President and CFO), Catherine Reynolds (Senior Vice President and General Counsel), Brian Rich (Senior Vice President) and Garrick Rochow (Senior Vice President).
Executive Summary
2018 Performance Highlights
In 2018, we continued to deliver strong financial performance marking 16 years of meeting our adjusted earnings guidance. We believe that the highlights reflect on a successful     year of world class performance delivering hometown service with achievements in our triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.
PEOPLE – serving our customers, communities and co-workers.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
PLANET – going above and beyond environmental legislation to leave our planet better than we found it.
PROFIT – delivering consistent, industry leading financial performance.

Based on these achievements, our Annual Incentive Plan paid out at 136% of target and our long-term incentive ("LTI") program paid out at 161% of target for the performance-based     portion. The LTI performance-based payout was based on awards granted in 2015, with the payout of such awards determined based on CMS' relative TSR and LTI EPS (see The Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program, Equity Compensation, Plan       Performance Factor below) performance from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Program Design
We have designed our executive compensation elements to be balanced and simple, placing emphasis on consistent, sustainable and superior absolute and relative performance. The following     elements deliver our executive total direct compensation: base salary; annual incentive; and LTI.
BASE SALARY. Base salary is targeted to approximate the       median of a peer group made up of companies of similar business profile and size, and to reflect individual performance and internal considerations.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE. Annual incentive awards are based on the       achievement of Annual Incentive EPS (70% of annual incentive) and Annual Incentive OCF (30% of annual incentive) goals. For more information, see The Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program, Cash Compensation, Plan Performance Factor       below.
The 2018 Annual Incentive EPS target of $2.30, represented 6% growth over our 2017 actual adjusted EPS of $2.17. We have delivered adjusted EPS growth year after year for more than 10     years.
The Annual Incentive OCF target for 2018 was established based on the Board-approved budget for the year at $1,650 million, which remained flat from 2017 due to uncertainty related to pending Michigan Public Service         Commission decisions regarding tax reform refunds to our customers.
We pay an annual incentive only if the Annual Incentive EPS or Annual Incentive OCF meet or exceed the threshold levels approved by the Compensation Committee in January of each year.     Annual Incentive EPS and Annual Incentive OCF are used to determine the annual incentive payout because the Compensation Committee believes that these two metrics are the building blocks for growing the value of the Corporation and are good indicators     of how well we are executing our customer focused strategy. We place more weight on Annual Incentive EPS to reflect the Corporation's and shareholders' focus on earnings per share growth. The payout may be increased or reduced by 10% based on the     results of the operating metrics under the Consumers' Annual Employee Incentive Compensation Plan ("Consumers Incentive Plan"). We believe that this alignment with operational performance and the broader employee population is an important aspect of     our program design.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE. The LTI program consists of       performance-based restricted stock (75% of total LTI) and tenure-based restricted stock (25% of total target LTI).
The 2018 performance-based portion is eligible to vest after three years dependent upon our TSR performance and LTI EPS growth (each weighted equally) relative to the Performance Peer     Group. The 2018 LTI program is distinct from the annual incentive program in that it focuses on relative multi-year performance rather than absolute one-year performance. The tenure-based portion vests on the third anniversary of the award date.
Our 2018 LTI program is based on relative TSR performance and relative LTI EPS growth because the Compensation Committee believes that these measures offer a head-to-head comparison of     how well our management team performed compared to other management teams in our industry and further motivate management to increase shareholder and customer value through stock price and earnings growth.
We tie a portion of equity compensation to continued employment. The tenure-based restricted stock helps build executive share ownership and alignment with shareholders while serving as     an additional retention mechanism that is not subject to the year-to-year fluctuations of any performance measurement although the value is subject to the performance of our stock price.
In 2018, the performance-based restricted stock awards granted in 2016 completed the three-year performance period, with the post-performance period       tenure-based vesting satisfied in early 2019. The 2016 performance-based restricted stock awards vested based upon the relative TSR and LTI EPS
TABLE OF CONTENTS
growth performance during the performance period (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018). Our TSR for the three-year performance period (January 1, 2016       to December 31, 2018) was 56% while the median TSR for our Performance Peer Group was 54%, placing CMS, by comparison, in the 55th percentile. Our LTI EPS Growth for the three-year performance period (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018) relative to       the Performance Peer Group is not expected to be known until after March 20, 2019.
ADVISORY VOTE. The CMS advisory vote to approve executive compensation, as     described in the 2018 CMS Proxy Statement, resulted in a high level of shareholder support with approximately 99% of votes cast in favor of the proposal. We continued to employ the same performance-oriented program design during 2018.
The remainder of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis offers a detailed explanation of the NEO compensation program.
Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program
The Compensation Committee is responsible for approving the compensation program for the NEOs. The Compensation Committee acts pursuant to its Charter that is annually reviewed by the     Board and is available on our website.
The NEO compensation program is organized around four principles:
Align With Increasing Shareholder Value
We believe that a substantial portion of total compensation should be delivered in the form of at-risk equity in order to further align the interests of the NEOs with the interests of     our shareholders and customers. Equity compensation is provided through the Performance Incentive Stock Plan ("Stock Plan"). In 2018, awards were subject to the achievement of three-year relative TSR performance and relative LTI EPS growth goals, each     weighted equally, over a three-year performance period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.
Assuming target performance, the following charts are an illustration of the pay mix for the CEO and the NEOs. The charts reflect actual pay data for       purposes of the pay mix for NEOs as of December 31, 2018.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Poppe's pay and other NEOs mix for 2018 was targeted at median levels of the Compensation Peer Group.
Enable Us to Compete for and Secure Top Executive Talent
Shareholders and customers are best served when we can attract, retain and motivate talented executives. We create a compensation package for NEOs that delivers total compensation     generally targeted to approximate the 50th percentile of the market. The Compensation Peer Group consists of energy companies comparable in business focus and size to CMS with which we might compete for executive talent. The Committee also reviews     size-adjusted public utility sector and general industry data, where comparable positions are identifiable.
Annually, the Compensation Committee engages a consultant to provide advice and information regarding compensation practices of the Compensation Peer Group as well as additional     information from published surveys of compensation in the public utility sector and general industry.
During the Compensation Committee's review of the CEO's and other officers' compensation levels, the Compensation Committee considered the advice and information received from Pay     Governance LLC ("Pay Governance"), the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant; however,
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Compensation Committee was ultimately responsible for determining the form and amount of executive compensation. During the time that Pay Governance has been engaged as the     compensation consultant, Pay Governance has not performed any services on behalf of management or otherwise been considered to have a conflict of interest regarding CMS or Consumers. The Compensation Committee must direct and approve any work Pay     Governance may undertake on behalf of management.
Reward Measurable Results
Base salary is reviewed annually and may be adjusted based on a variety of factors including each NEO's overall performance (both individual and functional) and tenure. The CEO     recommends annual base salary adjustments and annual restricted stock awards for all officers, other than the CEO. When making adjustments, the Compensation Committee considers the CEO's recommendations, along with Compensation Peer Group data,     internal equity, tenure, and other market data from surveys provided by the independent compensation consultant. CEO base salary is determined solely by the Compensation Committee and considerations include Compensation Peer Group data, other market     data and overall Corporation and CEO performance.
Annual incentives, the other form of cash compensation, provide for award opportunities to each NEO under the Annual Incentive Plan. The Annual Incentive Plan pays incentives on the     basis of performance during a one-year period. Performance objectives under the Annual Incentive Plan are developed at the start of each year through an iterative process. Management, including executive officers, develops preliminary recommendations     for the Compensation Committee's review and approval. For 2018, the Annual Incentive Plan targeted awards varied from 65% to 115% of each NEO's base salary, but payout could range from zero to 160% of target level depending on performance against     specific corporate performance goals.
For 2018, 75% of the equity compensation granted to the NEOs was performance-based, designed to reward measurable results. Vesting of such awards is subject to the achievement of     relative TSR performance and relative LTI EPS growth goals, weighted equally, over a three-year performance period of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.
The table below illustrates the manner in which: (a) the overall mix of total direct compensation was allocated between variable at-risk and fixed elements for each NEO; (b) variable     at-risk compensation was allocated between annual and long-term incentives; and (c) total direct compensation was allocated between cash and equity. Variable at-risk pay is generated from shareholder funds and is not included in the rates of Consumers'     electric and gas customers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Be Fair and Competitive
We strive to create a compensation program that is fair and competitive, both internally and externally. This is accomplished by evaluating each NEO's individual performance and by     comparing the NEOs' compensation to:
USE OF TALLY SHEETS. At least annually, the Compensation Committee reviews     tally sheets for each of the NEOs. These tally sheets reflect all components of compensation, including base salary, short-term (annual) and LTI compensation, retirement benefits, deferred compensation benefits, death benefits, and benefits or payments     that would be payable in connection with a termination of employment or change-in-control. Tally sheets are provided to the Compensation Committee to show how various compensation and benefit amounts are interrelated and how a change in one component     of compensation impacts other components and to enable the Compensation Committee to quantify amounts payable upon various termination scenarios.
The overall purpose of these tally sheets is to consolidate all of the elements of actual and potential future compensation of the NEOs, as well as information about wealth accumulation.     Using tally sheets, an analysis can be made of both the individual elements of compensation (including the compensation mix) and the aggregate total amount of actual and projected compensation. Tally sheet information is used in various aspects of the     analysis and compensation decision-making process including consideration of our management team's internal pay equity.
The Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program
This section describes the various elements of our compensation program for NEOs, together with a discussion of various matters relating to those items, including why we chose to include     the items in the compensation program.
Cash Compensation
Cash compensation is paid in the form of base salary and annual incentive. Our 2018 compensation program for NEOs was designed so that the percentage of       target cash compensation for the NEOs is comparable to the median of the Compensation Peer Group. That strategy resulted in cash-based compensation (as a percentage of total compensation) representing approximately 35% for the CEO and 47% to 58% for the other NEOs. The components making up the cash portion of total compensation are described in more detail below.
BASE SALARY. Base salary is included in the NEO's annual compensation package     because we believe it is appropriate that some portion of NEO compensation be provided in a form that is fixed and liquid.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each January, the Compensation Committee determines the base salary for each then-serving NEO. In addition, base salaries may be adjusted during the year to reflect changes in job     responsibilities or promotions. In the case of new hires, base salaries are determined based on market data and internal equity. Changes in base salary year-over-year are dependent on comparison to market data, past performance and expected future     contributions of each individual. The annual increases in base salaries for NEOs in 2018 were as follows:
ANNUAL INCENTIVE. We use performance-based                  cash incentives as an element of compensation because they enable us to provide an incentive to the NEOs to accomplish specific performance priorities for CMS and provide additional cash compensation only if performance                  goals approved by the Compensation Committee are achieved. Generally, the threshold, target and maximum performance goals are set so that the difficulty in achieving a payout is consistent from year to year. For 2018, the Annual Incentive Plan was       based on our success in meeting established earnings per share and operating cash flow goals described further below. The performance goals are set at levels reflecting our budgeted performance and targeted growth and are based on historical and       forecasted financial performance, and analysis of peer performance goal guidelines.
The Annual Incentive Plan allows the Compensation Committee to exercise "negative discretion" to reduce or eliminate payouts but does not allow discretion to increase payouts.
Incentive payout ranges under the Annual Incentive Plan were approved in January 2018 by the Compensation Committee. In determining the payout ranges of incentives, the following factors     were considered:
Payments under the Annual Incentive Plan can range, on the basis of performance, from 15% (threshold) to 160% (maximum) of the target incentive. Subject to the     Compensation Committee's use of negative discretion, for 2018 a minimum payout would be earned if either a threshold Annual Incentive EPS performance goal of $0.04 below or a threshold Annual Incentive OCF performance goal of $100 million less than     target were achieved and there would be a maximum payout if Annual Incentive EPS performance of $0.07 more than target is achieved and Annual Incentive OCF performance of $120 million more than target is achieved.
ANNUAL AWARD FORMULA. Annual awards for each eligible       officer are based upon a standard award percentage of the officer's base salary for the performance year and are calculated and made as follows:
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Individual Award = Base Salary X Standard Award Percentage X Plan Performance Factor X Consumers Incentive Plan modifier.
The Standard Award Percentages for officers are determined annually by the Compensation Committee as discussed above. Standard Award Percentages of base salary for NEOs in 2018 were as     follows:
PLAN PERFORMANCE FACTOR. We refer to Annual Incentive EPS and Annual Incentive OCF performance under the Annual     Incentive Plan as the "Plan Performance Factor."
For 2018, Annual Incentive EPS performance constituted 70% of the Plan Performance Factor and Annual Incentive OCF performance constituted the remaining 30% of the Plan Performance     Factor. The Compensation Committee believes that the allocation between earnings per share and operating cash flow performance aligns our performance objectives with our Peer Group and our utility-focused strategy.
The annual award would be reduced by 10% if no award were earned under the operational metrics of the Consumers Incentive Plan and the award would be increased     by 10% (but in no event shall the award exceed the maximum of the target annual incentive) if the maximum payout were achieved under the operational metrics of the Consumers Incentive Plan (potential adjustment referred to as "Consumers Incentive Plan     modifier"). This potential adjustment provides linkage of executive compensation with our performance goals related to safety, reliability and customer value. No such adjustments to the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan were made as the Consumers Incentive     Plan achieved six of the nine operational goals, which did not result in the maximum payout being achieved. See the table below for a listing of the operational goals.

PLAN PERFORMANCE RESULTS.
The following is the payout table for the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018.
2018 Annual Incentive EPS was $2.33 which exceeded the target of $2.30, resulting in achievement of a 140% payout for this metric. Annual Incentive OCF was $1,812 million, which exceeded     the target of $1,650 million, resulting in achievement of a 160% payout for this metric. The Compensation Committee exercised its negative discretion to ensure management did not benefit from the regulatory timing lag of tax reform-related credits to     customers, and to reflect the company's safety performance in 2018, resulting in a 136% award payout, after consideration for the Compensation Committee's discretion.
Equity Compensation
We have generally followed a practice of making all equity awards to our officers on a single date each year. We do not have any program, plan or practice to time annual equity awards to     our executives in coordination with the release of material non-public information. In 2018, annual equity awards were made to the NEOs in January and are planned to be made in January on an on-going basis. This enables the Compensation Committee to     review total compensation holistically at one time and adjust the levels of various compensation elements and compensation mix as necessary for each individual.
STOCK PLAN. As previously indicated, we provide a substantial portion of NEO compensation in the form of equity     awards because we believe that such awards serve to align the interests of NEOs with our shareholders and customers. Equity awards to the NEOs are made pursuant to our Stock Plan, which was approved by shareholders in May 2014, and took effect June 1,     2014. The Stock Plan permits awards in the form of stock options, incentive options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom shares and performance units. The minimum vesting period under the stock plan is 36 months     for restricted stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. No dividends are paid on unvested performance-based stock awards. In lieu of dividends, recipients receive additional shares of restricted stock that vest based on the same performance     measures applicable to the underlying restricted stock.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK. At the present time, we believe       that performance-based restricted stock (also known as performance shares) is an effective form of equity compensation because of the alignment it creates with shareholders. After the vesting, there is no holding period requirement as long as       specific stock ownership guidelines have been met by the NEO, see Corporate Governance as it Relates to Executive Compensation, Stock Ownership Guidelines, below. The Stock Plan also contains a clawback provision, see Corporate         Governance as it Relates to Executive Compensation, Clawback Provisions, below.
Three-quarters of the restricted stock awards have been delivered as performance-based and one-quarter as tenure-based in order to link a significant portion of each NEO's compensation     to the long-term performance of the Corporation. The performance criteria for the performance-based restricted stock awards is a comparison of relative TSR performance and EPS growth to the same criteria of the Performance Peer Group, each weighted     equally, utilizing the following relative pay to performance schedule:
The 20-day stock price averages preceding and including the award date and preceding and including the three-year anniversary of the award date are used to determine the relative TSR     performance. The EPS growth is determined over the three-year performance period beginning with the start of the fiscal year of the grant and ending at the close of the third fiscal year. The 2018 tenure-based awards vest if the NEO remains employed by     the Corporation on the three-year anniversary of the date of the award, subject to prorated vesting upon an earlier retirement or termination due to disability.
PLAN PERFORMANCE FACTOR. Under the LTI, CMS Adjusted (non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share ("LTI EPS") is determined in     accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude the following, if applicable:
CAP ON PAYOUT. If absolute TSR performance or LTI EPS       growth is negative for the three-year period, the total payout for the three-year period cannot exceed 100% of the total award based on relative TSR performance or LTI EPS growth to the Performance Peer Group.
RELATIVE TO PERFORMANCE RESULTS.                    In 2018, the performance-based restricted stock awards granted in 2015 completed the three-year performance period (January 2015 to December 2017) and service requirements. The 2015 performance-based restricted stock awards vested based       upon our relative TSR and LTI EPS growth performance. Our TSR for the three-year performance period was 52% while the median TSR for our Performance Peer Group was 34%, placing CMS, by comparison, at the 78th       percentile. Our LTI EPS Growth for the three-year performance period was 22% while the median EPS growth for our Performance Peer Group was 11%, placing CMS, by comparison, at the 87th percentile. This resulted in the 2015 performance-based       restricted stock award vesting at 161% of target (TSR=171% and LTI EPS Growth=192%).
In 2019, the performance-based restricted stock awards granted in 2016 completed the three-year performance period (January 2016 to December 2018) and service requirements. The 2016     performance-based restricted stock awards vested based upon our relative TSR and EPS growth
TABLE OF CONTENTS
performance. Our TSR for the three-year performance period was 56% while the median TSR for our Performance Peer Group was 54%, placing CMS, by comparison, in the 55th percentile,     resulting in a vesting level of 112.5% of target. Our EPS Growth for the three-year performance period was 23%. Our EPS Growth for the three-year performance period (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018) relative to the Performance Peer Group is not     expected to be known until after March 20, 2019.
In determining the amount of equity compensation that is provided to each NEO in a given year, we consider factors such as retention and incentive practices, the relative percentages of     cash and equity paid by the Compensation Peer Group and other market data. Based on these factors, the CEO recommends to the Compensation Committee restricted stock awards for the NEOs, other than the CEO. The Compensation Committee reviews and     approves or modifies the equity grants to the other NEOs. CEO restricted stock awards are determined based principally on overall CEO performance and Compensation Peer Group data.
Adjustments in 2018 equity target awards as compared to 2017 were intended to better align equity awards with the market.
OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES. There have been no stock option grants since August 2003 and there are no outstanding     options. The Compensation Committee periodically considers the use of stock options as part of the current compensation package for officers but has determined not to include stock options for LTI at this time. If a stock option were to be granted, the     stock plan prohibits:
Perquisites
As part of our competitive compensation plan, the NEOs are eligible for limited perquisites provided by or paid for by us, which include an annual mandatory executive physical     examination, retired executive survivor benefits and relocation expenses. Perquisites provided to the NEOs are reviewed on a regular basis. In 2018, we paid no relocation expenses to NEOs.
Physical Examination
The annual mandatory physical examinations for all NEOs are at a facility of our choosing and at our expense. The physical is required because the Compensation Committee believes     that it is an effective method of protecting the NEOs and us from preventable health-related disruptions.
Retired Executive Survivor Benefit
The retired executive survivor benefit plan, which has been closed to new participants since July 1, 2011, provides a survivor benefit after retirement for certain employees who     held high-level management or executive positions prior to their retirement. This self-funded plan is a supplement to the retired employees' group term life insurance plan. For additional information regarding the retired executive survivor benefit,     see Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control, below.

Post-Termination Compensation
SEVERANCE AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL BENEFITS. Certain NEOs are eligible to receive severance payments and other benefits     if the officer's employment terminates for a qualifying event or circumstance as well as change-in-control benefits upon a qualifying event or circumstance after there has been a change-in-control of CMS. For additional information regarding severance     and change-in-control benefits, including a definition of key terms and a quantification of benefits that would have been received by the NEOs had a qualifying termination or change-in-control occurred on December 31, 2018, see Potential Payments       upon Termination or Change-in-Control, below.
We believe that these severance and change-in-control arrangements are an important part of our executive compensation program and will help to secure the continued employment and     dedication of the NEOs, notwithstanding any concern they may have regarding their own continued employment, prior to or following a change-in-control. These agreements are useful for recruitment and retention as nearly all members of the Compensation     Peer Group have comparable terms and conditions in place for their senior employees.
Deferred Compensation Plans
We have two deferred compensation plans that allow certain employees, including the NEOs, to defer receipt of base salary and/or incentive payments: Deferred Salary Savings Plan ("DSSP")     and the Annual Incentive Plan. The Annual Incentive Plan allows for deferral of up to 100% of the annual incentive award. CMS does not match incentive amounts that are deferred pursuant to the Annual Incentive Plan. Participants have only an unsecured     contractual commitment from us to pay the amounts due under both the DSSP and the Annual Incentive Plan. For additional information regarding the DSSP, see DSSP, under Narrative to 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table, below.
We offer these plans to be competitive with market practice and to permit highly taxed employees to defer the obligation, at their discretion, to pay taxes on certain elements of     compensation that they are entitled to receive. The provisions of the DSSP and the Annual Incentive Plan permit them to do this while also receiving investment returns on deferred amounts. We believe these benefits are useful as retention and     recruitment tools as many of the Compensation Peer Group companies provide similar plans to their senior employees.
Tax Qualified Pension and Retirement Plans
The Corporation sponsors tax-qualified pension and retirement savings plans that cover a broad group of employees.
Pension Plan
The Consumers Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined-benefit plan that covers salaried employees, including NEOs, hired on or before     June 30, 2003. Reynolds participates in the Pension Plan. For additional information regarding the Pension Plan, see Pension Plan, under Narrative to 2018 Pension Benefits and DB SERP Table, below.
Cash Balance Plan
An interim Cash Balance Plan was in effect for salaried employees hired between July 1, 2003 and August 31, 2005. The Cash Balance Plan is a funded, tax-qualified,     noncontributory defined-benefit plan. Benefits under the Cash Balance Plan are based on employees' earnings and placed in a notional account that grows at a prescribed interest rate and is payable from the
TABLE OF CONTENTS
general assets of the pension fund. Rochow is a participant in the Cash Balance Plan. All employees in the Cash Balance Plan are now participants in the Defined Company     Contribution Plan.
Defined Company Contribution Plan
Salaried employees, including NEOs, hired after June 30, 2003 (including anyone previously eligible for the Cash Balance Plan), are eligible to participate in the Defined     Company Contribution Plan ("DCCP"), a tax-qualified, noncontributory, defined contribution plan. We provide a contribution ranging from 5% to 7% of regular compensation based on tenure to the DCCP on behalf of the employee. Poppe, Hayes, Rich and     Rochow are the NEOs covered under the DCCP. For additional information regarding the DCCP, see DCCP, under Narrative to 2018 All Other Compensation Table, below.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP")
The Corporation maintains two supplemental executive retirement plans that allow certain employees, including eligible NEOs, to receive benefits in excess of the benefits that would be     payable under the Pension Plan and DCCP.
Defined Benefit SERP
The Defined Benefit SERP ("DB SERP") is an unfunded plan, paid out of our general assets, which provides an amount substantially equal to the difference between the amount     that would have been payable under the Pension Plan (ignoring IRC limits) and the amount payable under the Pension Plan. Any employee, including any NEO, who was hired or promoted to an eligible position after March 31, 2006, is not eligible to     participate in the DB SERP. Reynolds is the only NEO eligible for the DB SERP. For additional information regarding the DB SERP, see DB SERP, under the Narrative to 2018 Pension Benefits and DB SERP Table, below.
Defined Contribution SERP
The Defined Contribution SERP ("DC SERP") is a nonqualified tax deferred defined contribution plan established for employees, including NEOs, not eligible to participate in     the DB SERP. Poppe, Hayes, Rich and Rochow participate in the DC SERP. For additional information, see DC SERP, under Narrative to 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table, below.
We believe that our pension and retirement plans and the SERPs are a useful part of the NEO compensation program and assist in the retention of our senior executives since benefits increase     for each year that these executives remain employed by us and continue their work on behalf of our shareholders and customers. We have considered the issue of potential overlap between the two long-term focused plans (SERPs and equity compensation) and     concluded that both are appropriate elements. The SERPs are designed to provide a predictable retirement income, while the equity plan is performance-based and variable and is designed to align the interests of NEOs with our shareholders and customers.     Further, we believe both long-term focused plans are consistent with typical market practice and supportive of the philosophy to provide a competitive NEO compensation program.
Employees' Savings Plans
Under the Employees' Savings Plan for Consumers and affiliated companies, a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan ("Savings Plan"), participating employees, including     NEOs, may contribute a percentage of their regular earnings into their Savings Plan accounts. For additional information, see Savings Plan, under Narrative to 2018 All Other Compensation Table, below.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
We maintain the Savings Plan for our employees, including the NEOs, because we wish to encourage our employees to save some percentage of their cash compensation for their eventual     retirement. The Savings Plan permits employees to make such savings in a manner that is relatively tax-efficient.
Competitive Data
The Compensation Peer Group data, where available by position, serves as the primary reference point for pay comparisons of utility-specific roles. Broader survey data and published proxy     data are also provided by the compensation consultant as a point of reference for utility specific roles and comparisons of general industry roles (primarily for staff positions). Where available by position, Pay Governance gathers compensation data     from Willis Towers Watson's Energy Services Executive Database (which includes approximately 50 investor-owned utilities) and Willis Towers Watson's General Industry Executive Database (which includes more than 500 participating companies), which it     size-adjusts based on CMS' revenues to provide additional market context to the Compensation Peer Group. In selecting members of the Compensation Peer Group, financial and operational characteristics are considered by the Compensation Committee. The     criteria for selection of the Compensation Peer Group included comparable revenue (ranging from approximately 30% to 160% of CMS) relevant industry characteristics, business mix (revenue mix between regulated and non-regulated operations) and     availability of compensation and financial performance data.
The 2018 Compensation Peer Group is composed of the companies set forth below. The 2018 Compensation Peer Group is consistent with the Compensation Peer Group used to evaluate 2017     compensation decisions, with the exception of the removal of Pepco Holdings, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. as these entities were acquired by other entities outside of the Compensation Peer Group.
The Compensation Committee recognizes that there is a difference between the companies against which we compete for executive talent ("Compensation Peer Group") and the companies against     which we compete for capital ("Performance Peer Group") and, therefore, uses different peer groups for these two different purposes. For this reason, the Compensation Committee approved the use of the Compensation Peer Group shown above, for evaluating     2018 NEO compensation decisions and a larger peer group, the Performance Peer Group shown below, as a reference for relative performance. The Performance Peer Group is used to measure relative TSR performance and EPS growth. The Compensation     Committee's rationale for using two peer groups is to provide appropriate comparative companies relative to the different attributes being evaluated for compensation and relative performance purposes. In addition, the larger Performance Peer Group     considered by the Compensation Committee was intended to provide for better gradation of resulting performance position than the Compensation Peer Group could have, given its size.
For awards made in 2018, the Performance Peer Group was composed of the publicly traded utilities included in the S&P 500 and S&P Midcap 400 indexes. If a Performance     Peer Group company is no longer trading as of the LTI vesting date, it is excluded from the LTI performance calculation. As of the 2018 LTI grant dates, the Performance Peer Group consisted of the following companies:

Corporate Governance as it Relates to Executive Compensation
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We have established stock ownership guidelines for our officers. These guidelines require our officers to maintain or establish an equity stake in CMS and thereby more closely     link their interests with those of our shareholders. These stock ownership guidelines provide that, within five years of becoming an officer or receiving a promotion to a higher ownership requirement, each officer must own shares of CMS common stock     with a value of one to five times base salary, depending on his or her position. Shares of performance-based restricted stock are not counted toward stock ownership guidelines. All NEOs were in compliance with these guidelines as of December 31, 2018.
The following table illustrates the required NEO stock ownership guidelines:
Failure of an officer to comply with the guidelines shall result in the following:

Clawback Provisions
The Compensation Committee has approved "clawback" provisions for certain compensation and benefit plans. These provisions provide the Compensation Committee the discretion to     require the forfeiture and return of past benefits or awards if there is a restatement of financial results. The Compensation Committee may also, at its discretion, require a return of a benefit or award in the event of a mistake or accounting error in     the calculation of such benefit or award.
Shareholder's Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
As part of the Compensation Committee's on-going review of executive compensation, we considered the affirmative 2018 CMS shareholder advisory vote (approximately 99% of the     votes cast) to approve executive compensation as described in last year's Proxy Statement and determined that the current philosophy, objectives and compensation elements continue to be appropriate. As such, the Compensation Committee did not make any     changes to our executive compensation programs in response to the 2018 CMS shareholder vote. Despite the overwhelmingly high level of CMS shareholder support, we continue to monitor best practices and emerging trends and engage with our large     institutional holders regarding compensation elements.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation
For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, federal tax reform changed IRC Section 162(m) to apply to a corporation's CEO, CFO, other three highest compensated     executive officers, and certain former executive officers ("covered employees") and removed the provision that provided for an exemption for performance-based compensation paid pursuant to a plan which is approved by shareholders of a corporation which     satisfied certain other regulatory requirements. These changes make compensation, other than certain grandfathered arrangements, that is greater than $1 million per year paid to covered employees non-deductible. Because the Compensation Committee also     recognizes the need to retain flexibility to make compensation decisions that may not meet the standards of IRC Section 162(m), the Compensation Committee may approve nondeductible compensation if necessary or desirable to achieve the goals of our     compensation philosophy.

Compensation and Human Resources Committee Report
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CMS and Consumers oversee CMS' and Consumers' compensation programs on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling their oversight     responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth in this Combined Proxy Statement.
In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be     included in CMS' and Consumers' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and CMS' and Consumers' Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A relating to CMS' and Consumers' 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders each of which will be or     has been filed with the SEC.

2018 Summary Compensation Table
The following table contains compensation information for the NEOs of CMS and Consumers for 2018 and, to the extent required by SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, 2017     and 2016.
2018 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE
The 2018 grant date fair value for the EPS growth performance-based restricted stock was $1,781,243 for Poppe; $446,257 for Hayes; $375,022 for Reynolds;     $206,267 for Rich; and $290,644 for Rochow.
The grant date fair value for the EPS growth performance-based restricted stock, assuming the maximum achievement of the performance goals, would have been     $3,562,486 for Poppe; $892,514 for Hayes; $750,044 for Reynolds; $412,534 for Rich; and $581,288 for Rochow;

Narrative to 2018 Summary Compensation Table
Employment Agreements
During 2018, none of the NEOs were employed pursuant to a traditional employment agreement with CMS or Consumers. Poppe, Hayes, Reynolds, Rich and Rochow have each entered     into a Change-in-Control Agreement and an Officer Separation Agreement. Please see Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control, below, for a description of such agreements.
Restricted Stock Awards
Please see Compensation Discussion and Analysis, The Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program, Equity Compensation, above for a description of the Stock Plan,     pursuant to which restricted stock is awarded.
Cash Incentives
In 2018, the Compensation Committee established potential cash incentives for each of the NEOs under the Annual Incentive Plan. The amount of the potential incentive was tied     to satisfaction of Annual Incentive EPS and Annual Incentive OCF targets approved by the Compensation Committee. The Annual Incentive Plan incentives were earned by the NEOs at 136% of target and are reported as "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"     in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Please see Compensation Discussion and Analysis, The Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program, Cash Compensation, above for a description of the Annual Incentive Plan.
Salary and Incentive in Proportion to Total Compensation as Defined by the 2018 Summary Compensation Table
The NEOs generally receive from 35% to 58% of their total direct compensation in the form of base salary and cash incentive awards under our Annual     Incentive Plan. As noted above, we believe that a substantial portion of each NEO's compensation should be in the form of equity awards. We believe that our current compensation program gives the NEOs substantial alignment with shareholders,     while also permitting us to provide incentive to the NEO to pursue specific annual and long-term performance goals. Please see Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program, above for a description of     the objectives of our compensation program and overall compensation philosophy.

2018 All Other Compensation Table

Narrative to 2018 All Other Compensation Table
DCCP
Salaried employees, including NEOs, hired after June 30, 2003 are eligible to participate in the DCCP. Under the DCCP, CMS provides a contribution based on regular     compensation tiered for tenure as follows: 0-5 years equals 5% (unless hired before January 1, 2016, 6%); 6-11 years equals 6%; and 12 plus years equals 7%, up to the IRC compensation limit ($275,000 for 2018), to the DCCP on behalf of the employee     which vests immediately and is payable upon termination of employment. Poppe, Hayes, Rich and Rochow are the NEOs covered under the DCCP and are eligible to receive a contribution equal to 6%, 5%, 6% and 7%, respectively, of regular compensation.
Savings Plan
Under the Savings Plan for Consumers and affiliated companies, participating employees may contribute a percentage of their regular earnings into their Savings Plan accounts.     NEOs, because they are considered highly compensated, may only contribute up to 20%, subject to the IRC annual dollar limit. In addition, under the Savings Plan, an amount equal to 100% of the first 3%

and 50% of the next 2% of employees' regular earnings contributions are matched by the Corporation. The matching contribution is allocated among the participant employees'     investment choices. Amounts held in Savings Plan accounts may not be withdrawn prior to the employee's termination of employment, or such earlier time as the employee reaches the age of 59½, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the IRC     regulations.

no additional preference service is provided. Each of the participating NEOs has reached this limit and, accordingly, is not eligible to accrue additional service credits. The     addition of preference service to the DB SERP benefit formula provides an increase to the DB SERP non-qualified benefit but does not affect the Pension Plan benefit. The present value benefit augmentation attributable to the preference service under     the DB SERP is as follows: Reynolds $0.
Narrative to 2018 Pension Benefits and DB SERP Table
Pension Plan
The Pension Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit plan. Benefits under the Pension Plan are based on the employee's years of service, age at     retirement and the sum of the five highest calendar years of base salary while employed with us and our affiliated companies divided by 60. Base salary excludes overtime pay and incentive and does not exceed the IRC compensation limit for a qualified     pension plan. Benefits are payable after retirement in the form of an annuity or a lump sum. The standard form of benefit is a life annuity for an unmarried employee and a 50% joint and survivor annuity for a married employee, with additional forms of     joint and survivor annuities available under the plan. The benefit formula is equal to 2.1% for the first 20 years of service and 1.7% for the next 15 years of service, to a maximum percentage of 67.5% for 35 years of service reduced by a Social     Security adjustment equal to 0.5% multiplied by 1/12th of the average of the participant's three most recent years of compensation, up to the maximum Social Security covered compensation for each year of service counted in the formula. To the extent an     employee exceeds 35 years of service under the Pension Plan, an additional $20 per month is added to the annuity after the adjustment for Social Security for each full year of service above 35. In accordance with SEC guidelines, the present value     information contained in this report is based on ASC 715 assumptions and is applied using the age at which a benefit is unreduced. Early retirement subsidies provided by the benefit formula of the Pension Plan and the actual discount rate required by     the U.S. Department of Treasury may provide a greater present value to a participant retiring on or after age 55 but prior to the age of an unreduced benefit.
The Pension Plan provides a pre-retirement survivor benefit to the spouse of a married employee or one named beneficiary of an unmarried employee. The Pension Plan provides a     disability retirement benefit to employees with at least 15 years of service who are found by the Corporation to be totally and permanently disabled equal to $26.00 for each year of plan service, plus an additional $350 per month if the participant     does not qualify for any Social Security disability benefit. The minimum monthly disability benefit is $450.
The Pension Plan currently limits the annual annuity benefit under IRC Section 415 to no more than $220,000 payable at age 65. Reynolds is currently eligible to elect early     retirement. At the minimum retirement age of 55, 65% of the normal retirement age (age 65) benefit is available. The Pension Plan retirement benefit is unreduced at age 62. The Pension Plan provides an add-on benefit for long-term employees when an     employee retires on or after age 58 and has 30 or more years of service. This add-on benefit is equal to the participant's accrued retirement income as of September 1, 2000, if any, multiplied by the early retirement percentage at the time of the     employee's retirement, and is added to the retiring employee's retirement annuity. The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit column above is determined using the ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits assumptions including a discount rate     (currently 4.48%) and mortality (currently based on the 2018 mortality table with projected mortality improvements.)
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Cash Balance Plan
The Cash Balance Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit plan. Benefits under the Cash Balance Plan are based on the employee's earnings. It is not an     individual account but is a benefit payable from the general assets of the pension fund. Rochow is the only NEO with a benefit in the Cash Balance Plan.
The Cash Balance Plan credits an amount equal to 5% of base pay received from the year the participant began earning credits through any pay period before September 1, 2005 to     a notional account. The credits were allocated on December 31 each year. The credits do not apply to incentive compensation amounts. The Cash Balance notional account is also increased annually with an interest credit based on the 30-year constant     maturity treasury bond.
If employment ends under the Cash Balance Plan, participants may elect to receive their benefit at the time the employment terminates, or they may elect to defer benefits to a     later date, but not later than age 70 1/2. Participants have the following payment elections: (1) a monthly payment for life; (2) a monthly payment for life with a 50% or 75% payment to a spouse or other individual upon death; or (3) a single sum equal     to account balance. Once payment begins under the Cash Balance Plan, no changes can be made to an election. If the choice was to defer receipt of benefits, interest credits will continue to be applied.
Effective September 1, 2005 the Cash Balance Plan was closed to new participants and any existing participants were eligible for the DCCP.
DB SERP
The DB SERP is an unfunded (for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA")) non-qualified supplemental defined benefit retirement plan that     provides benefits based on pay, incentives and added service that are not provided by the Pension Plan. In addition, for officers, including NEOs, the DB SERP provides for an additional year of service credit for each year of service until the total of     actual and additional service equal 20 years of service and includes any awards under the Annual Incentive Plan as earnings. The maximum benefit under the DB SERP is attained after 35 years (including the additional years of service credit) and no     further service credit is provided. Based on prior service, Reynolds (the only participating NEO) has reached the additional service credit limit. Benefits under the DB SERP plan will be payable after retirement to Reynolds in the form of an annuity.     The benefit formula used to determine the DB SERP annuity is the same as that used for the Pension Plan; however, the DB SERP does not contain the add-on benefit described above. The DB SERP does include annual incentive payments as part of the benefit     calculation. The Pension Plan annuity is subtracted from the DB SERP annuity to determine the annuity payable from the DB SERP. Although a rabbi trust (a trust that is established for the benefit of its participants except that creditors of the     Corporation can obtain the assets of the trust) has been established by the Corporation for purposes of paying DB SERP benefits, participants have an unsecured contractual commitment from CMS to pay the amounts due under this plan. Participants with     five full years of service who voluntarily terminate service with CMS prior to age 55 receive a benefit without inclusion of incentives and added service starting the first of the month on or after their 55th birthday at a level equal to 38.3% of the     age 65 benefit. At the minimum retirement age of 55, 65% of the normal retirement age (age 65) benefit is available. The DB SERP benefit is unreduced at age 62. The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit column in the table above is determined using the     ASC 715 assumptions including a discount rate (currently 4.32%) and mortality (currently based on the 2018 mortality table with projected mortality improvements).

Narrative to 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table
DSSP
An employee who has base salary (excluding any bonus, incentive or other premium pay) before deductions for taxes and other withholdings in excess of the IRC compensation limit     is eligible and may elect to participate in the DSSP. The DSSP is an unfunded (for the purposes of ERISA) non-qualified tax deferred defined contribution plan. The DSSP is funded by CMS through the use of trusts. However, participants have only an     unsecured contractual commitment from the Corporation to pay the amounts due under the DSSP and any funds are considered general assets of the Corporation and are subject to claims of creditors.
A participant in the DSSP may elect in the prior year to defer 0% or 5% of his or her base salary that exceeds the IRC compensation limit and the Corporation will match 100% of     the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of the deferral, which is the same matching rate as the Savings Plan (equivalent to 4%). In addition, a DSSP eligible participant may elect an additional deferral of up to 50% of the participant's base salary for the     calendar year. This additional deferral is not eligible for a Corporation match. The combined maximum total of the DSSP deferral amount and a 5% Savings Plan deferral is 59% of base salary. At the time a participant elects a deferral, a distribution     election is also made for this class year deferral. Each class year deferral is payable either at a certain date five or more years in the future or upon separation from service with the
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Corporation either as a series of payments over 2 to 15 years or in a lump sum. The participant decides how Corporation contributions are invested among a broad array of mutual     funds selected by us and provided by the record keeper.
Earnings in the DSSP are based on the change in market value of the mutual funds selected by the participant. All NEOs are eligible for the DSSP.
DC SERP
The Corporation established a DC SERP for employees not eligible to participate in the DB SERP. Under the DC SERP, the Corporation provides an amount equal to 5%, 10% or 15%     (depending on salary grade) of employee regular earnings plus any awards under the Annual Incentive Plan. Funds equal to the DC SERP are transferred to a mutual fund family at the time we make a contribution. Earnings or losses are based on the rate of     return of the mutual funds selected by the participant. Although the DC SERP is funded by the Corporation, participants have an unsecured contractual commitment from us to pay the amounts due under this plan. Poppe, Hayes, Rochow, and Rich are the NEOs     covered under the DC SERP. Rich and Rochow receive benefits at the 10% level and Poppe and Hayes receive benefits at the 15% level. Full vesting under the DC SERP occurs at age 62 with a minimum of five years of service. Vesting is on a pro-rata basis     for years prior to age 62.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control
As noted above under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Post-Termination Compensation, Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits, our executives are eligible to receive     separation and change-in-control benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment. These benefits are provided through two separate types of agreements:
We have entered into OS Agreements and CIC Agreements with the remaining NEOs. The OS Agreements provide for payments and other benefits if the officer is terminated under circumstances     specified in the OS Agreement unrelated to a change-in-control (as defined in the CIC Agreements). The CIC Agreements provide for payments and other benefits only if the NEO is terminated under the circumstances specified in the CIC Agreements within     two years following a change-in-control.
OS AGREEMENTS. The OS Agreements provide for payments of certain benefits, as described in the table below, upon     circumstances of termination of the employment of the NEO. Central to an understanding of the rights of each NEO is an understanding of the definition of "Cause." For purposes of these agreements:
If the Corporation does not have Cause and terminates an NEO who has an OS Agreement for any reason, the NEO receives the benefits described in the table below.
These agreements require, as a precondition to the receipt of these payments, that the NEO sign a standard form of release in which he or she waives all claims that he or she might have     against the Corporation and certain associated individuals and entities. These agreements also include non-
TABLE OF CONTENTS
compete and non-solicitation provisions that would apply for a period of 12 months following the NEO's termination of employment and non-disparagement and confidentiality provisions     that would apply for an unlimited period of time following the NEO's termination of employment. Payments under these agreements are payable in a lump sum.
Under the OS Agreements, tenure-based restricted stock awards will vest on a pro-rata basis based upon the service provided prior to the termination date while performance-based     restricted stock awards will vest at the end of the performance period on a pro-rata basis based on service provided during the performance period up to the termination date and actual performance of the Corporation.
CIC AGREEMENTS AND PROVISIONS. The CIC Agreements contain provisions that provide for payments in the event of a     change-in-control. The change-in-control provisions ("CIC Provisions") function in a manner similar to the severance provisions in the OS Agreements, except that NEOs become entitled to benefits under the CIC Provisions only in the event of a double     trigger consisting of a change-in-control and qualifying termination of employment during the two-year period following the change-in-control. As part of the CIC Provisions, a portion of the severance payments to a terminated NEO is consideration for     the NEO entering into a "non-compete" agreement.
A change-in-control of CMS is defined in the CIC Agreements to mean:
The definitions of Cause and Good Reason are central to an understanding of the NEO's rights under the CIC Provisions. Under the CIC Provisions, "Cause" has the same meaning as set     forth in the OS Agreements discussed above.
The NEO is said to have Good Reason to terminate his or her employment under the CIC Provisions if the assignment to the NEO of duties is materially inconsistent with his or her position     (including status, offices, titles, and reporting requirements), authority, or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the change-in-control; the Corporation takes any action which results in a material diminution of the NEO's position,     authority, duties, or responsibilities as constituted immediately prior to the change-in-control (excluding an isolated, insubstantial, and inadvertent action which is remedied by the Corporation promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the     NEO); there is a material reduction in the NEO's base salary, incentive opportunity, Stock Plan award level, benefits, or status; or under other circumstances specified in the definition, including the relocation of the NEO's principal job location or     office to more than 35 miles from its location at the time of entry into the CIC Agreement. Payments under the CIC provisions are payable in a lump sum.
The benefits to be provided to the NEOs in each of those situations are described in the table below, which assumes that the termination had taken place on December 31, 2018, the last     business day of our most recent fiscal year.
The CIC Agreements with each NEO do not contain tax gross-up provisions with respect to IRC Section 280G and Section 4999 excise taxes. The CIC Agreements contain a "best net benefit"     provision which provides that the Corporation's payments to the NEO can be reduced to the extent that no portion of the reduced payments shall be subject to the excise tax, but only if the NEO's net after-tax benefit is
TABLE OF CONTENTS
greater than his or her net after-tax benefit would have been if such reduction were not made and the NEO paid the excise tax.
Restricted stock under the CIC Agreements includes double-trigger vesting provisions (meaning, both a change-in-control and a qualifying termination of employment must occur in order     for the equity to vest). Under the CIC Agreements, all performance-based restricted-stock awards will vest on a pro-rata basis based upon the service provided prior to the change-in-control date with any performance-based restrictions vesting at target     level.
NEOs cannot receive benefits under both the CIC Provisions and the severance provisions of their agreement(s).
RETIREMENT/DISABILITY/DEATH. Upon death, 100% of the restricted stock vests with any performance-based restricted     stock vesting at target levels. Upon retirement or disability, tenure-based restricted stock awards will vest on a pro-rata basis based upon the service provided prior to retirement or disability while performance-based restricted stock awards vest at     the end of the performance period on a pro-rata basis based on service provided during the performance period prior to the retirement or disability and actual performance of the Corporation during the performance period. In the case of retirement or     disability, the Compensation Committee has the discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to waive the forfeiture of restricted stock awarded.
RETIRED EXECUTIVE SURVIVOR BENEFIT. The retired executive survivor benefit plan provides a survivor benefit after     retirement for certain employees who held high-level management or executive positions prior to their retirement. This plan is a supplement to the retired employees' group term life insurance plan. The amount of the survivor benefit payable to a     participant's beneficiary upon the participant's death equals 140% of annualized base salary preceding the date of retirement. This amount is reduced by 10% on every anniversary of the participant's retirement until the benefit amount reaches a minimum     of 50% of the initial benefit amount. The amount is further reduced based on insurance payable by life insurance plans purchased by us.
The plan was closed to new participants on July 1, 2011. An eligible participant must be a minimum of 60 years old at the time of retirement or termination to qualify for retired     executive survivor benefits. As of December 31, 2018, Reynolds is the only NEO eligible for benefits under this plan. The value of Reynolds' benefit would range from a minimum of $425,100 to a maximum of $865,200 depending on the date of her death     relative to her retirement date.
The following table provides information concerning potential payments upon termination or change-in- control as of December 31, 2018 for each NEO.

Proposal 2:
Approve, on an Advisory Basis, Executive Compensation
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are conducting an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve our compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") as disclosed     in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. The Compensation Committee did not make any changes to our executive compensation program since the last shareholder vote, which strongly favored the program (approximately 99% of each of CMS and     Consumers votes cast were affirmative). We continue to engage with our large institutional holders regarding compensation elements.
As described in detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this Proxy Statement, the Corporation's NEO compensation program is organized around four principles: (1)     align with increasing shareholder value; (2) enable the Corporation to compete for and secure top executive talent; (3) reward measurable results; and (4) be fair and competitive.
We have designed our executive compensation elements based on balance and simplicity to place emphasis on consistent, sustainable and superior absolute and relative performance.
We annually review all elements of the Corporation's executive compensation program and, in addition to complying with required rules, we adopt current best practices where appropriate     for our business and shareholders. As a result, we have:
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Shareholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure.
This proposal gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the overall compensation of the NEOs and the compensation philosophy, policies and practices disclosed in     this Proxy Statement. For the reasons discussed above, we are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for the NEO compensation by voting FOR the following resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED: that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and     Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure, is APPROVED.
This vote is an advisory vote only, and therefore it will not bind CMS or Consumers, the Board or the Compensation Committee. The vote results will not create or imply any change to     fiduciary duties or create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for CMS or Consumers or the Board. However, we value the opinions that our shareholders express in their votes and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive     compensation decisions as they deem appropriate.
Consistent with the direction of the CMS shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the Consumers shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of     Shareholders, the advisory vote on NEO compensation for CMS and Consumers will be held on an annual basis.

Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of the 1) integrity of financial statements; 2) performance of the internal     audit function and independent auditors; 3) independent auditor's qualifications and independence; and 4) compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee has a written charter that complies with New York Stock Exchange     requirements. Management has the primary responsibility for the preparation, presentation and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting process, including the systems of internal controls.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited consolidated financial statements set forth in CMS' and Consumers' 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and Form 10-K     for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), who are responsible for performing an independent audit of CMS' and Consumers' financial statements and expressing an opinion on the     conformity of those audited consolidated financial statements with United States generally accepted accounting principles, the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 61 (codified as Auditing Standard No. 1301)—Communications     with Audit Committees and other applicable requirements of the PCAOB and SEC rules.
The Audit Committee has received a report on the quality control procedures of PwC. The Audit Committee has also discussed with management, the internal auditors and PwC the quality and     adequacy of CMS' and Consumers' internal controls, with particular focus on compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Audit Committee reviewed with the internal auditors and PwC their audit plans and audit scope.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, termination, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor. PwC has served as CMS and Consumers' independent     registered public accountants since 2007. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. In conjunction     with the mandated rotation of the lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its Chair are directly involved in the selection of PwC's lead engagement partner. The Audit Committee has received from PwC the written communications required by     applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and have discussed with PwC their independence from CMS and Consumers. The Audit Committee has discussed with PwC the compatibility of     non-audit services with the auditor's independence and has satisfied themselves as to PwC's independence.
In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Boards that the audited consolidated financial statements be     included in CMS' and Consumers' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Fees Paid to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
PwC was the principal independent registered public accounting firm for CMS and Consumers for the years 2018 and 2017. The following table sets forth the aggregate fees, including     expenses, for professional services, billed by PwC to CMS (consolidated total including Consumers and its subsidiaries) and Consumers (including its subsidiaries), in each of the last two fiscal years.
Audit fees include fees associated with the annual audit, the reviews of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, comfort letters, required statutory audits, fees related to the audit of our     internal controls over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other attest services. Audit-related fees include fees associated with assistance related to accounting systems and controls. Tax fees include fees for     assistance with implementing a workflow management tool for tax compliance and planning. All other fees are related to business impact analysis activities.
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires pre-approval for all audit, audit-related, tax and other services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.     The policy provides for pre-approval by the Audit Committee of specifically defined audit and non-audit services. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year, the Audit Committee must approve the permitted     service before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to perform it. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee authority to approve permitted services, provided that the Chair reports any decisions to     the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services performed by the principal independent registered public accounting firm were approved in accordance with the policy in 2018.

Proposal 3:
Ratify the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee's selection of the independent auditor shall be submitted to our shareholders for their ratification at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If a majority of shares     voted do not ratify the Audit Committee's selection, the Audit Committee will consider our shareholder views when considering selection of a different independent auditor or the continued retention of the existing auditor for that year.
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm (taking into account the vote     on shareholder ratification). The Audit Committee has selected PwC, independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the consolidated financial statements for the year 2019. PwC has served as our independent registered public accountants since     2007. The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the retention of PwC. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of     the independent registered public accounting firm. In conjunction with the mandated rotation of the lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its Chair are directly involved in the selection of PwC's lead engagement partner. The members of the     Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PwC as independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. A representative of PwC will be present at the 2019 Annual     Meeting of Shareholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions.

Proposal 4:
Vote on a Shareholder Proposal Relating to Political Contributions Disclosure
To Be Voted On By CMS Shareholders Only
We have been notified that shareholder proponents intend to present a proposal for consideration at the CMS Annual Meeting. The shareholder proposal and       supporting statement appear below, and are presented as submitted to CMS. The CMS Board has recommended a vote against this proposal. The CMS response is set forth immediately following the proposal. The name, address and share holdings of the       shareholder proponents will be supplied upon request. 
Shareholder Proposal 
Resolved: That the shareholders of CMS Energy Corporation ("CMS" or "Company") hereby request that     the Company provide a semiannual report to disclose the Company's:
The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the     annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.
Supporting Statement
As long-term shareholders of CMS, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered     intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal,     state, or local candidates.
Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which     said:
[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed       decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.
Publicly available records show CMS has contributed at least $12.7 million in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle (CQMoneyLine: http://moneyline.cq.com;                  National Institute on Money in State Politics: http://followthemoney.org).
TABLE OF CONTENTS
However, relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to     trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations,     which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including Noble Energy Inc., PG&E Corp., and Sempra Energy, which present this information on their     websites.
The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this     critical governance reform.

 CMS Board of Directors' Recommendation Against and Statement of Opposition    The Board opposes this shareholder proposal and believes its adoption is unnecessary and would cause CMS to incur undue costs and administrative burdens without              commensurate benefit to our stakeholders, including shareholders, for the following reasons: 1.     The request is not in the best interests of CMS or its shareholders. 2.     The request is duplicative of CMS' robust governance and oversight practices 3.     The request would not provide shareholders with any more meaningful information than is already publicly reported   A guiding principle of CMS' political spending strategy is to optimize engagement with stakeholders and create long term shareholder value. CMS has a long tradition as a responsible corporate citizen and is committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards when it engages in political activity. The              Board believes CMS has a responsibility to shareholders and customers to constructively participate in the political process to further the best interests of our shareholders and customers. The Board believes that it is important for us to              support the legislative process by participating in political activity when it is consistent with CMS' business strategy and as permitted by law. The Board supports many of the objectives expressed in the shareholder proposal, however, the              Board believes that the level of specific disclosure requested by the proposal could have unintended consequences and could impact CMS' ability to pursue its purpose: World Class Performance Delivering Hometown Service.   CMS has strong governance and accountability surrounding political spending and upholds the highest level of board oversight. The Board oversees our political engagement policies, practices and controls. This oversight along with the Board's alignment with our                current disclosure standards provide the necessary accountability to ensure that political activities are conducted in the best interest of shareowners and other constituents.   Through Board oversight, CMS has maintained a rigorous compliance process to ensure that its political activities are lawful, properly disclosed and align with our Code              of Conduct. In addition to complying with CMS' political engagement policies, political contributions are also subject to federal, state and local regulation. As with all of our business activities, CMS is committed to complying with all laws              and regulations applicable to our political participation activities.   Significant disclosure regarding CMS' political activities and related policies is already publicly available. CMS' political engagement policies, programs and practices, including the governance and decision-making process for corporate political contributions, are described in              detail on our website at https://www.cmsenergy.com/corporate-governance/political-engagement. Required contribution information can also be found on various state and federal websites and are available through links on our website. We              maintain a political action committee ("PAC") funded by employee contributions (not corporate contributions) and all PAC contributions are publicly disclosed. We also participate in trade associations for their expertise and insights on issues              important to our industry. These associations may participate in the political process from time to time. We do not join trade associations to advance political purposes, and our membership does not represent our agreement with all of the trade              associations' positions or views, nor do we control their political activity in any way. Nonetheless, CMS discloses on our website trade association payments when they exceed $25,000 and when the trade association uses a portion of the money              for federal lobbying activities.   In summary, the Board believes our thoughtful political strategy, strong governance and Board oversight, and significant public disclosure appropriately address the              concerns cited in the shareholder proposal. As a result, the Board does not believe additional disclosure is warranted at this time and the production of an additional report as requested would be an unnecessary and imprudent use of CMS' time              and resources.   The CMS Board recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal relating to political contributions disclosure.

The request would not provide shareholders with any more meaningful information than is already publicly reported   A guiding principle of CMS' political spending strategy is to optimize engagement with stakeholders and create long term shareholder value. CMS has a long tradition as a responsible corporate citizen and is committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards when it engages in political activity. The              Board believes CMS has a responsibility to shareholders and customers to constructively participate in the political process to further the best interests of our shareholders and customers. The Board believes that it is important for us to              support the legislative process by participating in political activity when it is consistent with CMS' business strategy and as permitted by law. The Board supports many of the objectives expressed in the shareholder proposal, however, the              Board believes that the level of specific disclosure requested by the proposal could have unintended consequences and could impact CMS' ability to pursue its purpose: World Class Performance Delivering Hometown Service.   CMS has strong governance and accountability surrounding political spending and upholds the highest level of board oversight. The Board oversees our political engagement policies, practices and controls. This oversight along with the Board's alignment with our                current disclosure standards provide the necessary accountability to ensure that political activities are conducted in the best interest of shareowners and other constituents.   Through Board oversight, CMS has maintained a rigorous compliance process to ensure that its political activities are lawful, properly disclosed and align with our Code              of Conduct. In addition to complying with CMS' political engagement policies, political contributions are also subject to federal, state and local regulation. As with all of our business activities, CMS is committed to complying with all laws              and regulations applicable to our political participation activities.   Significant disclosure regarding CMS' political activities and related policies is already publicly available. CMS' political engagement policies, programs and practices, including the governance and decision-making process for corporate political contributions, are described in              detail on our website at https://www.cmsenergy.com/corporate-governance/political-engagement. Required contribution information can also be found on various state and federal websites and are available through links on our website. We              maintain a political action committee ("PAC") funded by employee contributions (not corporate contributions) and all PAC contributions are publicly disclosed. We also participate in trade associations for their expertise and insights on issues              important to our industry. These associations may participate in the political process from time to time. We do not join trade associations to advance political purposes, and our membership does not represent our agreement with all of the trade              associations' positions or views, nor do we control their political activity in any way. Nonetheless, CMS discloses on our website trade association payments when they exceed $25,000 and when the trade association uses a portion of the money              for federal lobbying activities.   In summary, the Board believes our thoughtful political strategy, strong governance and Board oversight, and significant public disclosure appropriately address the              concerns cited in the shareholder proposal. As a result, the Board does not believe additional disclosure is warranted at this time and the production of an additional report as requested would be an unnecessary and imprudent use of CMS' time              and resources.   The CMS Board recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal relating to political contributions disclosure.

CMS and Consumers' Bylaws provide that in order for a shareholder to propose business or nominate persons for election to the Board at an annual meeting that will not be     included in the proxy statement for that annual meeting, written notice containing the information required by our Bylaws must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary no later than 60 days nor earlier than 90 days before the anniversary of the prior     year's annual meeting, that is, after February 3, 2020 but no later than March 4, 2020 for the 2020 Annual Meeting. Any matter must comply with our Bylaws.
CMS Bylaws also permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, who have owned continuously for at least three years a significant amount of the outstanding shares of     common stock of the Corporation (at least 3%) to submit Director nominees (not greater than two or 20% of the Board) for inclusion in its proxy statement if the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in CMS' Bylaws. Notice of proxy     access Director nominees must be received by CMS' Corporate Secretary no less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the date the Corporation mailed its proxy statement for the prior year's annual meeting, that is after     October 23, 2019 but no later than November 22, 2019 for the 2020 Annual Meeting.

GENERAL INFORMATION
What are the Proxy Materials?
The Proxy Materials include:
If you received the Proxy Materials by mail, they also include a proxy card or voter instruction form for use in connection with the 2019 Annual Meeting. We are releasing these Proxy Materials to shareholders on or about March 21, 2019.
What matters are up for a vote at the CMS Annual Meeting,       how are they counted and what are their requirements?
The table below shows the voting options, voting requirement and effect of abstentions and Broker Non-Votes for each proposal to be presented at the CMS Annual Meeting.
The CMS Board does not intend to bring any other business before the CMS Annual Meeting. However, a shareholder has notified CMS of his intent to propose a resolution at the     Annual Meeting that, if approved, would, among other things, request that CMS publish a report of actually incurred corporate costs and associated actual and significant benefits accruing to shareholders and the climate from the company's     climate-related activities that are voluntary and exceed government regulatory requirements. This shareholder proposal is referred to as the "Floor Proposal."
The Floor Proposal was not submitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and the shareholder did not seek to have the Floor Proposal included in this Proxy Statement.     Accordingly, the Floor Proposal may be presented at the meeting but is not included in this Proxy Statement. If the Floor Proposal is presented at the Annual Meeting, then the proxies will have, and intend to exercise, discretionary voting authority     under Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act to vote AGAINST the Floor Proposal. If any other matters (including matters incident to the conduct of the meeting) are properly presented at the meeting, it is intended that the holders of the proxies will     vote in their discretion.

What matters are up for a vote at the Consumers Annual       Meeting, how are they counted and what are their       requirements?
The table below shows the voting options, voting requirement and effect of abstentions and Broker Non-Votes for each proposal to be presented at the Consumers Annual Meeting.
We are not aware of any other matters to be presented at the Consumers Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters (including matters incident to the conduct of the meeting)     are properly presented at the meeting, it is intended that the holders of the proxies will vote in their discretion.
Why did I receive a Notice of      Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?
To reduce the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting, we are providing the Proxy Materials over the Internet. As a result, we are sending many of our shareholders a Notice     of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Availability") instead of a paper copy of the Proxy Materials. All shareholders receiving the Notice of Availability may access the Proxy Materials over the Internet and request a paper copy by     mail. Instructions on how to access the Proxy Materials, vote online and request a paper copy can be found in the Notice of Availability. The Notice of Availability also contains instructions on how to request delivery of Proxy Materials in paper form     or electronically on an ongoing basis.
How can I access the Proxy Materials electronically or sign       up for electronic delivery?
All Shareholders can view, search and print the Proxy Materials at www.cmsenergy.com/investor-relations.
If you are a shareholder of record and you received printed Proxy Materials, you may elect to receive future Proxy Materials electronically. To do so you must enroll online at     https://materials.proxyvote.com/125896 for CMS and https://materials.proxyvote.com/210518 for Consumers. If you consent to receive Proxy Materials electronically, you will receive an e-mail notification when they become available. Your enrollment will     be effective until revoked.

If your shares are held in street name you should contact your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee and inquire about their electronic delivery options.
Who is entitled to vote?
Shareholders as of the close of business on the record date, March 5, 2019, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meetings. As of the record date, CMS' outstanding securities entitled to     vote consisted of 283,758,984 shares of CMS common stock. Each share is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the CMS Annual Meeting.
As of the record date, Consumers' outstanding securities entitled to vote consisted of 84,108,789 shares of shares of common stock held by CMS and       373,148 shares of preferred stock held by the public. Holders of Consumers' preferred and common stock are entitled to one vote for each share and shareholders have cumulative voting rights for the election of directors. That is, holders of preferred       and common shares are entitled to cast as many votes as equal the number of shares held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and they may cast all of such votes for a single nominee or distribute them among any two or more nominees as       they choose.
Your confidential vote is received and tabulated by an independent inspector of election. Your vote will not be disclosed except as required by law or in other limited circumstances.
What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a       "street name" holder?
If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered our shareholder of record for those shares.
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee you are considered the beneficial owner of the shares and your shares are said to be held in "street     name." Street name holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee how to vote using the method described under "How do I vote?" below.
How do I vote?
You can ensure that your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting by submitting your vote by telephone or Internet (the instructions are found on your proxy card, voting instruction form or     Notice of Availability). If you received your Proxy Materials by mail, you can complete and return your proxy card or voting instruction form by mail. Even if you vote by one of these methods, you can still attend and vote at the Annual Meeting.
If your shares are held in street name, you must vote your shares in the manner prescribed by your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee. Your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee should     provide a voting instruction form for you to use in directing it how to vote your shares. If you want to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee in advance of the     Annual Meeting and bring it with you.
What if I do not indicate my voting preference on my proxy?
If your shares are voted by proxy, the shares will be voted as you instruct. If you sign and properly submit your proxy, but do not give any specific voting instructions, your shares will     be voted as the Board recommends. Your shares will also be voted as recommended by the Board, in its discretion, on any other business that is properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Who may attend the Annual Meeting and are there any       requirements I must meet in order to attend in person?
Any shareholder of record as of March 5, 2019, or a representative with a proper written legal proxy signed by such shareholder, may attend. You will be asked to register upon arrival and     will be required to present proof of current stock ownership (such as a recent account statement) and government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license) prior to being admitted.
If your shares are held in street name and you do not obtain a legal proxy but still want to attend the Annual Meeting (and not vote your shares in person), you must provide evidentiary     material, such as broker statements or a letter from your brokerage firm proving ownership as of the record date. We reserve the right to restrict admission if evidentiary material is not definitive proof of proper and timely ownership. If you wish to     send a representative on your behalf, you must provide the evidentiary material as well as written proof that the representative is attending on your behalf.

How many shares must be present to hold the Annual       Meeting?
To constitute a quorum and transact business, shareholders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must be present in person or by proxy at each of the Annual Meetings.
What does it mean if I get more than one set of Proxy       Materials?
You may receive multiple copies of Proxy Materials if your shares are registered differently (i.e., trust, joint, name spelling variation, etc.) and/or if they are in more than one     account (i.e., brokerage firm, bank, transfer agent, etc.). If you wish to consolidate accounts, please contact Equiniti Trust Company at 1-855-598-2714. Please vote all of the proxies that you receive and consider consolidating accounts.
If your household receives multiple copies of the Proxy Materials or Notice of Availability, you may authorize us to discontinue duplicate mailings in the future by electing the option     when you vote, see "What is "householding" and how does it affect me?" below for additional householding information.
If your shares are held in street name and you are receiving multiple sets of materials and wish to consolidate accounts, please contact your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee.
What is "householding" and how does it affect me?
We have adopted a procedure called "householding" which has been approved by the SEC. Householding is intended to reduce the volume of duplicate information received by a household and     the cost of preparing and mailing duplicate information. Under this procedure, we are permitted to mail only one Notice of Availability or one set of Proxy Materials to multiple shareholders who share an address and who have consented to or have     received prior notice of our intent to do so, so long as we have not received contrary instructions from one or more such shareholders.

To resume the mailing of individual copies of future Proxy Materials or Notice of Availability and revoke your consent to householding, submit a written       request to Broadridge Householding Dept., 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, or make an oral request by telephone to 1-866-540-7095. If you participate in householding and wish to receive separate Proxy       Materials or Notices of Availability, we will promptly mail a copy if you notify us by making a written request to our Shareowner Services Department at One Energy Plaza, Jackson, Michigan 49201, or making a request by telephone to 1-517-788-0298.
If your shares are held in street name, you can request information about householding by contacting your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee.
Who conducts the proxy solicitation and how much will it       cost?
We are requesting your proxy for the Annual Meeting and will pay the costs of requesting shareholder proxies. Proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and other employees,     personally or by telephone, Internet, or mail, none of whom will receive compensation for their solicitation efforts. We have arranged for Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 501 Madison Ave., 20th Floor, New York, New York 10022, to solicit proxies for a fee of $20,000, plus expenses and disbursements. We will pay all proxy solicitation costs. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, dealers, banks, voting trustees     or other record holders for their reasonable expenses for forwarding Proxy Materials to beneficial owners of CMS and Consumers stock.
