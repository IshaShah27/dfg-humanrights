2018 was another year of significant growth for Brink's. We saw improvement in our financial results as we continued to execute on our strategy to accelerate profitable growth through acquisitions, including Dunbar Armored in the U.S., as well as organic margin improvement. We reported full year Operating Profit on a GAAP basis of $275 million (vs. $274 million in 2017) and non-GAAP Operating Profit* of $347 million, compared to $281 million in 2017. Our Operating Margin Rate on a GAAP basis was 7.9% (vs. 8.2% in 2017) and on a non-GAAP basis was 10.1% (vs. 8.8% in 2017). Earnings per share was $(0.65) on a GAAP basis and $3.46 on a non-GAAP basis. Our Compensation Committee and Board continue to adhere to a philosophy that aligns pay and performance through awards of annual and long-term incentives that balance management performance and shareholder returns. As we enter 2019, we remain dedicated to growing our Company and continuing to deliver value to our shareholders, while maintaining our high standards of corporate governance and our unwavering commitment to safety and security for our customers and employees. 
Your vote at the annual shareholder meeting is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote as soon as possible. There are two ways to vote. You can complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy in the envelope provided or you can vote on the internet.

PROXY SUMMARY 
To help you review The Brink's Company's ("Brink's" or the "Company") 2019 proxy statement, we have summarized several key topics below. The following description is only a summary. 
For more complete information about these topics, please review the complete proxy statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
2018 Highlights 
Brink's is the global leader in total cash management, route-based logistics and payment solutions, including cash-in-transit, ATM services, cash management services, including vault outsourcing, money processing and intelligent safe services, and international transportation of valuables to financial institutions, retailers, government agencies (including central banks), mints, jewelers and other commercial operations around the world. We serve customers in more than 100 countries and have approximately 
 62,400 employees worldwide. A significant portion of our business is conducted internationally, with approximately 73% of our revenues earned outside the United States. Brink's reported strong earnings growth in 2018. Following are key financial performance metrics that are monitored by management and the Board, reported to shareholders, and used in determining 2018 compensation for the named executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  These non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). See page 35 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating profit and revenue to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Program 
Our executive compensation program is structured to link compensation to Company and individual performance over the short- and long-term and to align the interests of executives and shareholders. We do this by using shares of the Company's common stock ("Brink's Common Stock") and stock-
 based awards in our incentive compensation programs and by maintaining robust executive stock ownership guidelines. Elements of compensation for Brink's executives include base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentives ("LTI").

PROXY SUMMARY 
2018 Compensation Decisions 
In February 2018, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Compensation Committee") approved LTI awards of Internal Metric PSUs, Relative TSR PSUs, Performance Stock Options and RSUs to the Company's named executive officers (no Internal Metric PSUs or RSUs were awarded to the Chief Executive Officer). Payouts of 2018 annual incentives to named executive officers were approved by the Compensation Committee in February 2019 ranging from approximately 108% to 137% of target (depending on the named executive officer), reflecting corporate performance that was above the target levels of the non-GAAP operating profit and revenue goals as well as performance in the countries within each executive's area of responsibility (where applicable) and individual performance factors. In 
February 2019, the Compensation Committee also approved payouts for LTI awards granted in 2016, which consisted of Internal Metric PSUs, Relative TSR PSUs and RSUs. Relative TSR PSUs were paid out in shares of Brink's Common Stock at 150% of target, reflecting relative TSR above the 75th percentile of peer companies and stock price appreciation of approximately 123% over the three-year period. Internal Metric PSUs were paid out in shares of Brink's Common Stock at 110% of target, reflecting performance that was above the target level for the two-year non-GAAP operating profit goal beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2017. These compensation decisions are more fully described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, beginning on page 25.

Shareholder Engagement 
At last year's annual meeting of shareholders, over 98% of votes cast approved the "say on pay" proposal regarding the compensation awarded to named executive officers. The Compensation Committee and the Board take into account the results of the "say on pay" vote as they consider the design of the executive compensation program and policies. 
There were no changes made to the Company's executive compensation program in direct response to the 2018 "say on pay" voting results. Members of management and the Board continue to engage in outreach to the Company's shareholders to discuss governance and compensation policies and practices and emerging issues.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
How many votes must be present to hold the annual meeting? 
A majority of the outstanding shares of Brink's Common Stock as of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions, withheld votes and shares held in street name ("Brokers' Shares") voted by brokers are included in determining the number of votes present. 
 Brokers' Shares that are not voted on any matter will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present. In the event that a quorum is not present at the annual meeting, we expect that the annual meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. 
What is a broker non-vote? 
Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, a broker may vote Brokers' Shares in its discretion on "routine matters," but a broker may not vote on proposals that are not considered "routine." When a proposal is a non-routine matter and the broker has not received voting instructions with respect to that proposal, the broker cannot vote on that proposal. This is commonly called a "broker non-vote." 
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal? 
The following table summarizes the vote required to approve each proposal and the effects of abstentions, broker non-votes, and signed, but unmarked proxy cards, on the tabulation of votes for each proposal. For any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting, proxies will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the person voting the proxies.

[END TABLE]
The Company's bylaws provide that the Chairman of the annual meeting will determine the order of business and the voting and other procedures to be observed at the annual meeting. The Chairman is authorized to declare whether any business is properly brought before the annual meeting, and business not properly brought before the annual meeting will not be transacted. We are not aware of any matters that are to come before the annual meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. If other matters do properly come before the annual meeting, however, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy card to exercise the discretionary authority conferred by the proxy to vote such proxy in accordance with their best judgment. 
The Brink's Company 
Can I revoke my proxy? 
The enclosed proxy is revocable at any time prior to its being voted by filing an instrument of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later time. A proxy may also be revoked by attendance at the annual meeting and voting in person. See "Questions and 
 Answers About the Annual Meeting—How do I attend the annual meeting? What should I bring?" Attendance at the annual meeting will not by itself constitute a revocation. 
Who pays for the solicitation of votes? 
The cost of this solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, directors, officers and employees of the Company, without receiving additional compensation therefor, may solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, in person or by other means. Arrangements also will be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of Brink's Common Stock and the Company will reimburse such brokerage firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with their solicitation efforts. The Company has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to perform proxy advisory and solicitation services. The fee of Innisfree M&A Incorporated in connection with the 2019 annual meeting is estimated to be approximately $15,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. 
How do I attend the annual meeting? What should I bring? 
Shareholders who wish to attend the annual meeting and vote in person and who need directions to the annual meeting may contact the Corporate Secretary at (804) 289-9600. Shareholders of record who wish to vote in person at the annual meeting will be able to request a ballot at the annual meeting. Shareholders who hold their shares through a broker in "street name" and who wish to vote in person at the annual meeting will not be able to vote their shares at the annual meeting without a legal proxy from the street name holder of record. Those shareholders should contact their brokers for further information. 
Who will count the votes? 
Shareholder votes at the annual meeting will be tabulated by the Company's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board of Directors 
Role of the Board of Directors 
The Board is responsible for advancing the interests of the shareholders by providing advice and oversight of the strategic and operational direction of the Company; overseeing the governance of the Company and the Company's executive management, including the Chief Executive Officer; and reviewing the Company's business initiatives, capital projects and budget matters. To do this effectively, the Company has established clear and specific Governance Guidelines for the Board (referred to as our Governance Policies) that, along with Board committee charters and our Code of Ethics, provide the framework for the governance of the Company. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board does not have a policy on whether the roles of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman should be separate. The Board regularly evaluates relevant factors to determine the best leadership structure for the Company's operating and governance environment at the time. In accordance with good governance practices, the Board's policy is to appoint a lead director from among the independent members of the Board in the event that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are combined. In response to significant changes in the Company's leadership, in 2016, the Board appointed Michael J. Herling as the non-executive Chairman of the Board. The Board believes the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer was appropriate at that time as it allowed, and continues to allow, Mr. Pertz to focus primarily on Brink's business strategy and operations and Mr. Herling to provide the independent leadership of the Board. As the non-executive chairman of the Board, Mr. Herling has the following responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       ensures the quality, quantity and timing of information from management;  
[END TABLE]
If the Chairman and CEO roles were to be combined in the future, a lead director would be appointed. We expect that a lead director would have the following responsibilities: 
The Brink's Company 
Meetings of the Board and Director Attendance 
The Board met six times in 2018. During 2018, all incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the committees of the Board on which they served. 
Executive Sessions of the Board 
The non-management members of the Board meet regularly without management present. The Chairman presides over each meeting of the independent Board members. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting 
The Company has no formal policy with regard to Board members' attendance at annual meetings. All of the directors then in office, with the exception of Mr. Boynton, attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Board Independence 
For a director to be deemed "independent," the Board must affirmatively determine, in accordance with the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, that the director has no material relationship with the Company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. In making this determination, the Board has adopted the following categorical standards as part of its Governance Policies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  A director who is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of the Company, or whose immediate family member  is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of the Company, is not independent. Employment as an interim Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other executive officer will not disqualify a director from being considered  independent following such employment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  A director who has received or who has an immediate family member serving as an executive officer who has received,  during any twelve-month period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from the Company (excluding director and committee fees and pensions or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service, provided such  compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), is not independent. Compensation received by a director for former service as an interim Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or other executive officer will not count toward the $120,000  limitation.  
  3.  (A) A director who is a current partner or employee of a firm that is the Company's internal or external auditor;  (B) a director who has an immediate family member who is a current partner of such a firm; (C) a director who has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on the Company's audit; or  (D) a director who was or whose immediate family member was within the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the Company's audit within that time, in any such instance ((A)-(D)) is not independent.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  A director who is or has been within the last three years, or whose immediate family member is, or has been within the  last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee, is not independent.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  A director who is a current employee, or whose immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that  has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues,  is not independent.  
[END TABLE]
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board has affirmatively determined that Ms. Docherty and Messrs. Boynton, Clough, Hedgebeth, Henry, Herling, and Stoeckert are independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the categorical standards described above. The Board has determined that the members of the Audit and Ethics Committee (the "Audit Committee") and the Compensation Committee meet the heightened independence requirements for service on the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee set forth in the respective committees' charters. In addition, the Board has determined that the members of the Compensation Committee are "non-employee directors" (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) and, to the extent necessary to qualify compensation incentives for 162(m) Transition Relief, "outside directors" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")). 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the "Corporate Governance Committee") and Finance and Strategy Committee (the "Finance Committee"). Each committee has a separate chairperson and each of the committees is composed solely of independent directors. The charters for each of the committees describe the specific authority and responsibilities of each committee and are available on our website at www.brinks.com.

The Brink's Company 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee oversees management's conduct of the Company's financial reporting process and the integrity of its financial statements, including the Company's accounting, internal controls and internal audit function. The Audit Committee also evaluates the qualifications and performance of the Company's independent auditors, assesses the independence of the Company's independent auditors and oversees the annual independent audit of the Company's financial statements and the Company's legal and regulatory compliance, as well as ethics programs. 
The Board has identified each of Messrs. Boynton, Clough and Stoeckert as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Board has also determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee is financially literate under New York Stock Exchange standards. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the policies and programs relating to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, and other senior executives, including policies governing salaries, incentive compensation and terms and conditions of employment. For a further discussion of the Compensation Committee, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
Corporate Governance Committee 
The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become Board members consistent with criteria approved by the Board and recommending to the Board director nominees. The Corporate Governance Committee also oversees the corporate governance of the Company, including recommending to the Board the Governance Policies, and the annual evaluation of the Board's performance. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Board any changes in non-employee director compensation. 
Finance Committee 
The Finance Committee monitors the Company's strategic direction, recommends to the Board dividend and other actions and policies regarding the financial affairs of the Company, and is responsible for oversight of the Company's 401(k) Plan and the Frozen Pension Plan, and any similar plans that may be maintained from time to time by the Company. The Finance Committee has authority to adopt amendments to the Company's 401(k) Plan and the Frozen Pension and Pension Equalization Plans. 
Director Nominating Process 
The Corporate Governance Committee regularly engages in succession planning for the Board. In accordance with the Governance Policies and the Corporate Governance Committee charter, the Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or other factors and considers possible director candidates. The Corporate Governance Committee has used professional search firms to identify candidates based upon the director membership criteria described in the Governance Policies. 
The Corporate Governance Committee's charter provides that the Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidate recommendations by shareholders. Shareholders should submit any such recommendations to the Corporate Governance Committee through the method described below under "Communications with Non-Management Members of the Board of Directors." In accordance with the Company's bylaws, any shareholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors at a meeting of shareholders may nominate persons for election to the Board, if the shareholder complies with the notice procedures set forth in the bylaws and summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled "Other Information—Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations" on page 77. 
The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all director candidates in accordance with the director membership criteria described in the Governance Policies. The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates any candidate's qualifications to serve as a member of the Board based on the skills and characteristics of individual Board members as well as the composition of the Board as a whole, the balance of management and independent directors, and the need for particular expertise. In addition, while there is not specific weight given to any one factor, the Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate a candidate's business experience, diversity, international background or experience, the number of 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
other directorships held, leadership capabilities, and any other skills or experience that would contribute to the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors. 
When considering a director standing for re-election as a nominee, in addition to the attributes described above, the Corporate Governance Committee considers that individual's past contribution and future commitment to the Company. The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the totality of the merits of each prospective nominee that it considers and does not restrict itself by establishing minimum qualifications or attributes. 
After evaluating any potential director nominees, the Corporate Governance Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the Board determines the nominees. The evaluation process of prospective director nominees is the same for all nominees, regardless of the source from which the nominee was first identified. 
The Company did not receive any notice of a director candidate recommended by a shareholder or group of shareholders owning more than 5% of the Company's voting common stock for at least one year as of the date of recommendation on or prior to November 23, 2018, the date that is 120 days before the anniversary date of the release of the prior year's proxy statement to shareholders. 
Board Evaluations 
The Board annually assesses the effectiveness of the full Board and the performance of its committees. The Corporate Governance Committee is charged with overseeing this process. In 2016, the Board implemented periodic evaluations by a third party and individual director assessments. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for the Company's overall risk oversight and receives regular reports from management on the Company's risk management program (described below) and from the Board's Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance, and Finance Committees, each of which is responsible for risk oversight within its area of responsibility. Management is responsible for the Company's risk management. Through the Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") program, management identifies and addresses significant risks facing the Company. Under the ERM program, a team of senior executives identifies and prioritizes risks, and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area, including by monitoring relevant mitigation plans and processes. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for discussing with management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies. As part of its responsibilities, the Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial policies, including financial risk management. Management holds regular meetings that identify, discuss and assess financial risk from current macro-
 economic, industry and company-specific perspectives. As part of its regular reporting process, management reports and reviews with the Audit Committee the Company's material financial risks, proposed risk factors and other public disclosures, mitigation strategies, and the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also engages in periodic discussions with the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President, Internal Audit and other members of management regarding risks. 
Each of the other committees of the Board considers risks within its respective areas of responsibility and regularly reports to the Board on issues related to the Company's risk profile. The Compensation Committee considers any risks related to the Company's executive compensation programs and has oversight responsibility for the Company's review of all compensation policies and procedures to determine whether they present significant risks. The Corporate Governance Committee considers risks relating to governance and succession planning. The Finance Committee reviews risks related to strategic transactions and oversees risks related to the Company's liquidity, credit ratings, and pension and savings plans. 
The Brink's Company 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
As part of its oversight of the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers any potential risk implications created by compensation awards. The Compensation Committee believes that the executive compensation program is designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to the Company's overall business strategy and that the balance of compensation elements does not encourage excessive risk taking. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider compensation risk implications, as appropriate, in designing any new executive compensation components. In connection with its ongoing risk assessment, the Compensation Committee notes the following attributes of the executive compensation program: 
The Compensation Committee also has oversight over the Company's responsibility to review all Company compensation policies and procedures, including the incentives that they create, to assess risk. At the Compensation Committee's direction, the Company's Human Resources Department in partnership with the Internal Audit Department, conducted a risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs during 2018. Based on its assessment, management concluded that the compensation policies and practices of the Company and its subsidiaries for employees do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and management presented the results of its assessment to the Compensation Committee. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Policy and Process for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
The Company has adopted a policy in the Audit Committee's charter regarding the review and approval of related person transactions. In the event that the Company proposes to enter into such a transaction, it must be referred to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is required to review and approve each related person transaction and any disclosures required by Item 404 of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee reviews any related person transactions on a case-by-case basis. 
For purposes of this policy, a "related person transaction" has the same meaning as in Item 404 of Regulation S-K: a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of related transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which the Company is, was or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any "related person" has, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
For purposes of this policy, a "related person" has the same meaning as in Item 404 of Regulation S-K: any person who was a director, a nominee for director or an executive officer of the Company during the preceding fiscal year (or an immediate family member of such a director, nominee for director or executive officer) or a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding Brink's Common Stock (or an immediate family member of such owner). 
During 2018, there were no related person transactions under the relevant standards. 
Communications with Non-Management Members of the Board of Directors 
The Company's Governance Policies set forth a process by which shareholders and other interested third parties can send communications to the non-management members of the Board. When interested third parties have concerns, they may make them known to the non-management directors by communicating via written correspondence sent by U.S. mail to "Chairman" at the Company's Richmond, Virginia address. All such correspondence is provided to the Chairman of the Board at, or prior to, the next executive session held at a regular Board meeting. 
Succession Planning 
The Board regularly engages in succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer role. Members of the Board (with oversight from the Corporate Governance Committee) annually review and discuss an evaluation of potential Chief Executive Officer successors. The Board ensures that meeting agendas for the Board and its committees provide directors with exposure to and opportunities to assess potential successors. The Board annually reviews the emergency succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer. 
Political Contributions 
In general, it is not the Company's practice to make financial or in-kind political contributions with corporate assets, even when permitted by applicable law. The Company complies with all applicable state and federal laws related to the disclosure of lobbying activities. 
The Company administers, under federal and state election laws, The Brink's Company Political Action Committee, which is a non-partisan political action committee comprised of the Company's managerial and professional U.S. employees who voluntarily pool their financial resources to support the Company's efforts to promote the business interests of the Company through the legislative process. 
The Brink's Company 
Resignation and Retirement 
Under the Company's Governance Policies, a director who retires or whose job responsibilities change materially from those in effect at the time the director was last elected to the Board should submit his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee will then review and consider the director's resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or decline the resignation. In addition, the Board maintains a policy that a director may not stand for election to the Board for any term during which his or her 72nd birthday would fall more than six months prior to the expiration of that term. 
The Company's Governance Policies also provide that any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of shareholder votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" his or her election must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee will then evaluate the best interests of the Company and will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. Following the Board's determination, the Company will disclose the Board's decision of whether or not to accept the resignation and an explanation of how the decision was reached. 
The Brink's Company 
PROPOSAL NO. 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
In accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and bylaws, directors are nominated for election (or re-election) to one-year terms. Each of the Company's directors is serving a term that expires in May 2019. 
The Corporate Governance Committee has recommended, and the Board has approved Ms. Docherty and Messrs. Boynton, Clough, Hedgebeth, Henry, Herling, Pertz and Stoeckert each as nominees for election to a one-year term expiring in 2020. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in this proxy statement. Unless otherwise specified, all proxies will be voted in favor of Ms. Docherty and Messrs. Boynton, Clough, Hedgebeth, Henry, Herling, Pertz and Stoeckert for election as directors of the Company. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees is not available or will not serve if elected. If any of them should become unavailable to serve as a director, full discretion is reserved to the persons named as proxies to vote for such other persons as may be properly nominated. 
Set forth below for each director nominee is information concerning the nominee's age, principal occupation, employment (including other positions with the Company), directorships during the past five years, and the year in which he or she first became a director of the Company. Also set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the conclusion that each nominee should serve as a director, in light of the Company's business and structure.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Summary 
2019 CD&A 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") and the executive compensation tables that follow describe the compensation of the Company's named executive officers: 
Information about named executive officers' salaries and any changes in 2018 can be found under "Base Salary" on page 31. Information about annual incentive targets and awards appears under "Annual Cash Incentives Awards – EIP and BIP" beginning on page 31. Information about LTI targets and awards appears under "Long—Term Incentive Compensation" beginning on page 35. 
2018 in Review 
Brink's reported strong earnings growth in 2018. Following are key financial performance metrics that are monitored by management and the Board, reported to shareholders, and used in determining compensation amounts for the named executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  These non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). See page 35 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating profit and revenue to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  
[END TABLE]
The Brink's Company 
2018 Annual and Long-Term Incentive Payouts 
Incentive program payout determinations for 2018 for the named executive officers reflect the Company's performance against specific, pre-established financial goals. The named executive officers received 2018 annual incentive payouts under the Executive Incentive Plan ("EIP") at a range of approximately 108% to 137% of their respective targets. These payouts reflect adjusted results that were above the target non-GAAP operating profit of $365 million and the target non-GAAP revenue of $3.4 billion established under the Company's Brink's Incentive Plan, as well as performance in the countries within each executive's area of responsibility (where applicable) and individual performance factors. See the description of 2018 annual incentive payouts beginning on page 33. 
Payouts for Relative TSR PSUs for the 2016 – 2018 performance period reflect TSR above the 75th percentile of the peer companies (reflecting stock price appreciation of approximately 123%), which resulted in payment of 150% of the target Relative TSR PSUs awarded in 2016. Payouts for Internal Metric PSUs for the 2016 – 2018 performance period reflect performance above the target level of non-GAAP operating profit established by the Compensation Committee and resulted in payment to each named executive officer of 110% of his target Internal Metric PSUs awarded in 2016. See pages 37 and 38 for a description of LTI payouts. 
2018 Compensation for Chief Executive Officer, Douglas A. Pertz 
The primary components of compensation for the Chief Executive Officer consist of base salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive. 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee established an annual incentive target of 125% of Mr. Pertz's base salary. Mr. Pertz received an annual incentive payout of $1,504,913 in March 2019, which represented approximately 123% of the target in light of Brink's performance against the pre-established performance goals and Mr. Pertz's individual performance. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an LTI award in the amount of $7,500,000 for Mr. Pertz, which was made up entirely of performance-based equity awards, a majority of which are Performance Stock Options that link vesting to stock price appreciation of 25% for certain awards and 50% for other awards, and are also subject to a three year time vesting requirement. In setting Mr. Pertz's 2018 LTI, the Compensation Committee considered relevant market data as well as his performance since being appointed Chief Executive Officer in June 2016, expected future contributions to the Company, and the retentive value of the award. 
Say on Pay Results and Shareholder Engagement 
At the 2018 annual meeting, over 98% of votes cast on the "say on pay" proposal approved the compensation awarded to named executive officers. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board take into account the results of the "say on pay" vote as they consider the design of the executive compensation program and policies. There were no changes made to the Company's executive compensation program in direct response to the 2018 "say on pay" voting results. Members of management and the Board continue to engage in outreach to the Company's shareholders to discuss governance and compensation policies and practices and emerging issues.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Process for Setting Executive Compensation 
Compensation Committee Review Process. The Compensation Committee sets each component of target compensation for the Company's named executive officers. At least annually, the Compensation Committee undertakes a comprehensive review of competitive market data and information regarding the value of target compensation levels provided to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives, including base salary, target annual incentive and LTI awards. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the Chief Executive Officer's evaluation of the performance of the other named executive officers, as well as his recommendations related to their compensation, when considering named executive officer target compensation and payout determinations. When the Compensation Committee considers base salary adjustments and sets annual incentive and LTI targets, it takes the following factors into account:

[END TABLE]
With respect to the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee reviews performance relative to annual objectives and competitive market data in order to make base salary and target annual incentive and LTI determinations and to make recommendations to the Board regarding annual incentive payments. The Compensation Committee is supported in its work by the Company's Human Resources Department and an independent executive compensation consultant as described below. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee receives data, analysis and support from Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), which serves as the Compensation Committee's and the Corporate Governance Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
In 2018, FW Cook provided the following services to the Compensation Committee: 
Role of Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer annually reviews each named executive officer's target compensation (other than his own) and recommends changes to elements of a named executive officer's target total compensation, as necessary, based on the factors identified under "Process for Setting Executive Compensation" above. The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations regarding payouts for annual incentives in accordance with the terms of the awards. The Compensation Committee considers the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations in making its own determinations regarding compensation awarded to the named executive officers. 
The Chief Executive Officer does not play any role in determining his own compensation. 
The Brink's Company 
Compensation Consultant Conflicts of Interest. In retaining FW Cook, the Compensation Committee considered the six factors set forth in Rule 10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) of the Exchange Act. In addition, after review of information provided by each of the members of the Compensation Committee as well as information provided by FW Cook and members of the FW Cook team, the Compensation Committee determined that there are no conflicts of interest raised by the firm's work with the Compensation Committee. 
Factors Considered in Making Compensation Decisions 
In determining target and actual compensation for the named executive officers in 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the following key factors. 
Performance. The executive compensation program provides the named executive officers with opportunities to receive actual compensation that is greater or less than targeted compensation, depending upon the Company's financial performance and their individual performance. 
Market Competitiveness. For the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee generally aims to set base salary, target annual incentive and target LTI compensation (in the aggregate) at approximately the market median relative to comparable positions within a relevant comparison group of companies (the 
 "Peer Group"), Brink's uses the market median as a reference to ensure pay practices are competitive overall and generally sets named executive officers' individual total target compensation between the 25th and 75th percentile of Peer Group compensation, depending on the criticality of the role, individual performance and long-term potential to create value for shareholders. 
The Company's peer group is designed to include companies of comparable size, companies with similar business characteristics (including revenue and market capitalization) and companies with which Brink's competes for talent and investor capital. Below is the list of companies included in the Peer Group for 2018 compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018 Peer Group Companies             
   2018 Peer Group Companies

 Cintas Corporation    ManTech International Corporation    Unisys Corporation 
 Diebold, Incorporated    Moneygram International    United Rentals, Inc. 
 DST Systems    Pitney Bowes, Inc.     
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews market information, including Peer Group compensation data, survey data and other reports on executive compensation practices in making its compensation decisions for named executive officers. Survey data is used as the primary reference point for all named executive officers. The Committee uses Peer Group data as an additional reference point for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles and for Mr. Zukerman's role. Based on its analysis and the compensation levels set for the Company's named executive officers in 2018, FW Cook has concluded that the Company's overall current total target direct compensation (including base salary and target annual incentive and LTI compensation) was between the 25th and 75th percentile of the relevant market data for each of the named executive officers, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, whose total target direct compensation exceeds the 75th percentile as a result of the 2018 LTI award, the amount of which was increased for 2018 in recognition of Mr. Pertz's performance and expected future contributions, and as a retention incentive. 
Mix of Cash and Stock-Based Compensation and Current, Short-Term and Long-Term Awards. The Compensation Committee considers the competitive market, compensation mix and pay for performance philosophy when setting various components of compensation. The Compensation Committee determined that current and short-term compensation (base salary and annual incentives) should be composed of cash, but that LTI compensation should be composed of stock-based awards that reward the achievement of Company results and increases in Company value over the long-term, and align named executive officers' interests with the economic interests of shareholders. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
In 2018, performance-based compensation (which includes annual incentives, Internal Metric PSUs, Relative TSR PSUs, and Performance Stock Options) represented approximately 90% of total target compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and approximately 59% of total target compensation (on average) for the Company's other named executive officers, as illustrated below 
2018 Compensation Decisions by Component 
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee's decisions on base salary levels for the named executive officers are primarily influenced by its review of competitive market information for comparable positions. These decisions are also influenced by the Company's talent philosophy, which includes differential investment in talent based on the executive's performance of his or her duties, criticality of the executive's role to the execution of corporate strategy, and the executive's potential to impact future business results. For the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee also considers the Chief Executive Officer's recommended salary adjustments based on position relative to the competitive market information. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved adjustments to base salaries for each of the named executive officers. For each of the officers other than Mr. Marshall, adjustments were made in connection with the Company's annual merit review process, which reflects the market-based merit budget as well as performance of each individual executive. For Mr. Marshall, the adjustment reflects a market-based adjustment to better align his compensation to the market median for the role of a Chief Administrative Officer leading both the Legal and HR functions. Following are the base salaries for each of the named executive officers as of December 31, 2018 (actual salary amounts for 2018 appear in the Summary Compensation Table on page 44):

Annual Cash Incentive Awards—EIP and BIP 
General 
The Company's annual cash incentive program for named executive officers provides incentive compensation that is variable, contingent and directly linked to Company and country or business unit performance. For 2017 and 2018, annual incentive awards for executive officers were paid under the EIP, which works in conjunction with the metrics and goals of the Brink's Incentive Plan ("BIP"), which governs annual incentives for other executives and employees. 
The EIP was approved by shareholders in 2017 and was designed to ensure that annual incentive compensation paid to executive officers was tied directly to the achievement of Company operating profit and was intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) and be 
The Brink's Company deductible by the Company, as permitted under applicable law. 
Under the EIP, the maximum award to be paid to the CEO is 1.5% of non-GAAP operating profit and the maximum award to be paid to any other named executive officer is 0.75% of non-GAAP operating profit. However, the Compensation Committee retains negative discretion to reduce the award below these maximum amounts payable. Using this negative discretion, the Committee may reduce the payout to an amount determined in accordance with the executive's annual incentive target and the Company's performance against the performance targets established under the BIP, as described below, and may take into consideration the performance of a named executive officer's business unit or function and the executive's individual performance. The Compensation Committee does not have discretion to increase the size of annual incentive awards under the EIP. 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee decided to terminate the EIP, in light of the changes to IRC Section 162(m) under U.S. Tax Reform. As a result of these changes to IRC Section 162(m), the EIP no longer facilitates the tax deductibility of certain awards to executive officers. Beginning with awards for the 2019 fiscal year, annual incentive awards to executive officers will be administered under the BIP. 
The Compensation Committee sets annual incentive performance metrics and goal(s) under the BIP in February of the performance year. In doing so, the Compensation Committee selects one or more metrics that it believes are aligned with the Company's financial and strategic goals for the year and selects a target level of performance for each metric that the Compensation Committee believes represents a rigorous goal. 
The Compensation Committee generally considers and approves actual annual incentive payments for the prior fiscal year in February. At the same time, the Compensation Committee certifies the amount of non-GAAP operating profit for the plan year and certifies that the awards to be paid to the named executive officers do not exceed the maximum awards permitted under the EIP. For 2018, the Compensation Committee used its negative discretion under the EIP to reduce the annual incentive payouts to named executive officers to a level consistent with the Company's performance against the pre-established BIP performance goals and each executive's individual performance. The Compensation Committee approves annual incentive payments to all EIP participants with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer. The Board approves any annual incentive payments to the Chief Executive Officer upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. In determining annual incentive payouts, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider Company financial results, the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and the other named executive officers and the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer (with respect to the other named executive officers.) 
2018 Annual Incentive Goal Setting 
The Compensation Committee approved two performance metrics for 2018 annual incentives under the BIP: non-GAAP operating profit (75% weighting) and non-GAAP revenue (25% weighting) in order to ensure focus on improving profitability while at the same time growing the Company's business. The named executive officers' 2018 annual incentive awards are tied to the achievement of the non-GAAP operating profit and revenue goals as set forth below. The Compensation Committee believes that these goals represent rigorous objectives for our named executive officers and align with shareholder interests. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Each year, in connection with the approval of the annual incentive performance goals, the Compensation Committee also approves specific adjustments that the Compensation Committee may make at the end of the year to the performance results against the goal. In 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that, when considering performance against the 2018 non-GAAP operating profit and revenue performance goals, it would exclude the positive or negative impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the positive or negative impact of foreign exchange translation versus the foreign exchange rates used in the Company's 2018 business plan, except for highly inflationary countries, where 50% of such foreign exchange translation would be excluded. 
The Compensation Committee applies straight-line interpolation for determining award payouts when performance results fall between the goals above. For example, achievement of $373.75 million non-GAAP 
 operating profit would equate to a payout factor of 125% for that performance metric.  
2018 Annual Incentive Target Award Opportunities 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee established 2018 annual incentive targets for the named executive officers. The annual incentive target is expressed as a percentage of annual base salary and is designed to be indicative of the incentive payment that each named executive officer would expect to receive on the basis of strong performance by the Company against the performance goals for the BIP. Annual incentive targets for 2018 were approved for each of the named executive officers by the Compensation Committee as set forth below. The Committee approved an increase in Mr. Domanico's annual incentive target for 2018 to better align his compensation with the market data for his role. Incentive payments cannot exceed 200% of each named executive officer's annual incentive target.

[END TABLE]
2018 Annual Incentive Payouts 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee (and the independent members of the Board for Mr. Pertz) approved 2018 annual incentive payouts for the named executive officers. To determine the actual annual incentive payments for the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee (and the independent members of the Board) considered the Company's non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP revenue against the goals set by the Compensation Committee in February 2018 as well as each executive's individual performance. For Messrs. Beech and Zukerman, the Compensation Committee also considered the performance of the operating companies within each executive's scope of responsibility, which is referred to as Combined Operating Performance. 
Annual Incentive Payout Calculation for Messrs. Pertz and Domanico 
The Brink's Company 
Annual Incentive Payout Calculation for Messrs. Beech and Zukerman 
The Company Performance Factor was determined by the Compensation Committee to be 117% which reflects the Company's adjusted non-GAAP operating profit results of $370 million versus the 2018 performance goal of $365 million and the adjusted non-GAAP revenue results of $3.425 billion versus the performance goal of $3.4 billion. In approving the results used to determine annual incentive funding and the Company Performance Factor, the Compensation Committee considered the Company's reported 2018 non-GAAP operating profit results of $347 million and non-GAAP revenue results of $3.438 billion, which were then adjusted upward to remove the impact of certain foreign exchange translation and the impact of divestitures during the year and adjusted downward to remove the impact of acquisitions during the year. Non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP revenue are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on page 35 of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
In addition to the strong Company performance that resulted in a Company Performance Factor of 117%, the Compensation Committee also considered Mr. Pertz's recommendations regarding individual performance of each of the named executive officers (other than Mr. Marshall, who was no longer serving as an executive officer at the time the Compensation Committee made its decisions regarding annual incentive payouts). 
For Mr. Domanico, the Committee approved an annual incentive at approximately 123% of target and considered Mr. Domanico's overall leadership of the Company's strong financial performance, including an increase in non-GAAP operating profit by 23% versus the prior year and an increase in free cash flow, as well as his efforts to amend the Company's credit agreement to reduce borrowing costs, increase borrowing capacity and extend the loan term. For Mr. Beech, the Committee approved an annual incentive at approximately 137% of target and considered the strong financial results in his area of responsibility, particularly the very strong results in Mexico, as well as Mr. Beech's effective leadership of the Company's global security organization. For Mr. Zukerman, the Committee approved an annual incentive at approximately 108% of target and considered the solid performance of the BGS business and the Rest of World segment. 
Mr. Pertz's annual incentive award was approved by the Board at approximately 123% of target, reflecting the Company's overall operating performance, including reported non-GAAP year over year revenue growth of 8% and a non-GAAP operating profit increase of 23%, with an improvement of 130 basis points in the Company's non-GAAP operating profit margin rate. The award also reflected Mr. Pertz's individual achievements in 2018, particularly with respect to continued development and execution of the Company's strategic plan, the successful execution of accretive acquisitions, including Dunbar, and continued transformation of the Company's culture. 
The following table sets forth the actual annual incentive payments for 2018. Annual incentive payments are also shown in the Summary Compensation Table on page 44.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
General 
The Company provides LTI compensation to ensure that a significant portion of named executive officer compensation is tied to the Company's long-term results and increases in shareholder value. In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved LTI awards to named executive officers that included Relative TSR PSUs, and Stock Options and, for all executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, Internal Metric PSUs and RSUs. 
Internal Metric PSUs. The performance period for the Internal Metric PSUs is generally three years, beginning on January 1 of the first year of the performance period and ending on December 31 of the third year of the performance period. Named executive officers benefit from Internal Metric PSUs only to the extent Brink's achieves performance goals determined by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. After the conclusion of the performance period, Internal Metric PSU payouts will be in shares of Brink's Common Stock and will range from 0 to 200% of the target award. The number of shares ultimately paid will depend on performance against the goals established by the Compensation Committee. 
Relative TSR PSUs. The performance period for the Relative TSR PSUs is generally three years, beginning on January 1 of the first year of the performance period and ending on December 31 of the third year of the performance period. Named executive officers benefit from Relative TSR PSUs only to the extent Brink's achieves performance goals determined by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. After the conclusion of the performance period, Relative TSR PSU payouts will be in shares of Brink's Common Stock and will range from 0 to 200% of the target award. The number of shares ultimately paid will depend on performance against the goals established by the Compensation Committee. 
RSUs. Each RSU is the economic equivalent of one share of Brink's Common Stock and is settled in shares of Brink's Common Stock. RSUs retain value even if the price of Brink's Common Stock decreases below the price on the date of grant as long as the named executive officer satisfies the vesting requirements. 
Stock Options. Each Stock Option represents an opportunity to purchase a share of the Company's common stock at the fair market value as of the grant date, subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting conditions. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Target Award Opportunities 
The Compensation Committee approved annual LTI awards in February 2018. For each of the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, 2018 LTI awards included equity awards under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan composed of Internal Metric PSUs (25% of the award), Relative TSR PSUs (25% of the award), RSUs (25% of the award), and Performance Stock Options (25% of the award). For Mr. Pertz, the Committee approved a 2018 LTI award that included Relative TSR PSUs (25% of the award) and Performance Stock Options (75% of the award). In establishing LTI compensation targets for each named executive officer for 2018, the 
The Brink's Company 
Compensation Committee primarily considered competitive market information, in the context of the overall LTI compensation philosophy, which takes into account the executive's skills and experience and potential future contributions to the Company. The Compensation Committee approves LTI awards based on a target dollar value that is then converted into a number of Relative TSR PSUs, Internal Metric PSUs, RSUs, and Performance Stock Options, based on the grant date fair value of each award type. The Committee believes this approach is aligned with the market-based LTI grant value determination for each position. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in Mr. Pertz's annual LTI in light of the Company's success following Mr. Pertz's appointment as CEO and his expected future contributions to the 
 Company and as a retention incentive. The Committee also adjusted the mix of equity vehicles in Mr. Pertz's LTI award to increase the proportion of Performance Stock Options, thereby substantially increasing the proportion of his performance-based, at-risk compensation. As a result, for 2018, Mr. Pertz's LTI was composed of Relative TSR PSUs (25% of the award), and Performance Stock Options (75% of the award, split equally between Performance Stock Options that vest only in the event of stock price appreciation of 25% or more and Performance Stock Options that vest only in the event of stock price appreciation of 50% or more). 
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of LTI award opportunities approved by the Compensation Committee for 2018, for each of the named executive officers. The equity awards appear in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 47.

Equity Awards under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan 
Internal Metric PSU Awards. In 2018, Internal Metric PSUs represented 25% of the LTI award for each named executive officer other than the Chief Executive Officer, who did not receive any Internal Metric PSUs. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee established non-GAAP EBITDA as the performance metric for the Internal Metric PSUs awarded in 2018 to incentivize leaders to execute our organic and acquisition growth strategy, align to one of the most common performance metrics used for LTI plans in our peer group and ensure that we did not have overlap with the metrics in our annual incentive plan. 
The Internal Metric PSUs awarded in 2018 are subject to a three-year performance period that began on January 1, 2018 and will end on December 31, 2020. 
The Compensation Committee established threshold, target and maximum levels of non-GAAP EBITDA for the Internal Metric PSUs, which correspond to payouts in shares of Brink's Common Stock at a rate of 0% to 200% of target as noted below. 
At the time the Compensation Committee established the target levels of performance, it believed that achievement of the threshold performance level was attainable, but not certain, that target performance would be difficult to achieve, and that the maximum level of performance was possible, but not likely to be achieved.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Relative TSR PSU Awards. In 2018, Relative TSR PSUs represented 25% of the LTI award for the CEO and 25% of each other named executive officer's LTI award. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee established that the Company's Relative TSR will be determined by the percentile rank of the Company's TSR for the performance period as compared to the TSR for the performance period for companies in the S&P Mid Cap 400 with foreign revenues that exceed 50% of total revenues. The Relative TSR PSUs awarded in 2018 are subject to a three-year performance period that began on January 1, 2018 and will end on December 31, 2020. 
The Compensation Committee established threshold, target and maximum levels of TSR performance, which correspond to payouts in shares of Brink's Common Stock at a rate of 0% to 200% as noted below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Below Threshold Performance    0%

[END TABLE]
At the time the Compensation Committee established the target levels of performance, it believed that achievement of the threshold performance level was attainable, but not certain, that target performance would be difficult to achieve, and that the maximum level of performance was possible, but not likely to be achieved. 
RSU Awards. In 2018, RSUs represented 25% of the LTI award for each named executive officer other than the Chief Executive Officer, who did not receive any RSUs. RSUs awarded as part of the named executive officers' 2018 long-term incentive awards will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
Performance Stock Options. In 2018, Performance Stock Options represented 75% of the CEO's LTI award and 25% of each other named executive officer's LTI award. Performance Stock Options awarded as part of the 2018 long-term incentive awards for named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if the average closing price of the Company's common stock during any 15 day period between the grant date and the three year anniversary of the grant date is 125% of the closing price on the grant date. Options representing half of the value of option awards to the Chief Executive Officer will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if the average closing price of the Company's common stock during any 15 day period between the grant date and the three year anniversary of the grant date is 125% of the closing price on the grant date, and options representing the other half of the value of option awards granted to the Chief Executive Officer will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if the average closing price of the Company's common stock during any 15 day period between the grant date and the three year anniversary of the grant date is 150% of the closing price on the grant date. 
2018 Long Term Incentive Payouts 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the level of payouts for the Relative TSR PSUs and Internal Metric PSUs that were awarded in 2016. The long-term incentive awards to the named executive officers were comprised of Relative TSR PSUs (37.5%), Internal Metric PSUs (37.5%) and RSUs (25%). The Relative TSR PSU payouts were determined by Brink's total shareholder return (calculated based on the 20 day average closing stock prices at the start and end of the three year performance period) as compared to companies in the S&P Small Cap 600 with foreign revenues exceeding 50%. The Compensation Committee approved a payout of Relative TSR PSUs at a level of 150% of target, which reflected TSR at the 75th percentile as compared to the peer companies (as a result of stock price appreciation from $29.79 per share at the beginning of the performance period compared to $66.53 per share at the end of the performance period). Individual payouts to each of the named executive officers appear in the Realized Pay Table on page 46. 
The PSU payouts for the 2016 – 2018 performance period were determined by the Company's performance against threshold, target and maximum levels of non-GAAP operating profit for a two year period (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2017) set by the Compensation Committee in February 2016. The 2016 – 2018 PSU design was approved by the 
The Brink's Company 
Compensation Committee in keeping with the desire to have a three year term for this LTI vehicle, while recognizing management's two year strategic plan period. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee considered the Company's performance against the goals. The performance exceeded the target performance level of $450 million of non-GAAP operating profit, which resulted in a payout of 110% of target shares. 
The cumulative non-GAAP operating profit performance result of $457 million reflects adjustments (in accordance with the terms of the 
 2013 Equity Incentive Plan) for the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, changes in pension accounting and exclusion of amortization expenses. These adjustments were designed to ensure that participants are neither helped nor hurt by changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in how we measure non-GAAP results or the impact or timing of acquisitions or divestitures. 
The following tables show the Company's performance against the PSU performance goals, resulting in the payouts described above. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  *  Reflects pre-approved adjustments, as described above.  
[END TABLE]
Tax Deductibility 
Prior to the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 ("Tax Reform"), under Section 162(m) of the Code, compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid in any one year to a publicly-held corporation's covered employees who are employed by the corporation at year-end would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes unless the compensation was considered "qualified performance-based compensation" (or another exemption is met). Covered employees included the Chief Executive Officer and the three other most highly-compensated executive officers as of the last day of the taxable year other than the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. 
As a result of Tax Reform: (i) the exception for qualified performance-based compensation was eliminated effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, (ii) the definition of "covered employees" was expanded to include the Chief 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Financial Officer, and (iii) "covered employee status" was made permanent for any executive who was a "covered employee" for any tax year beginning after December 31, 2016. However, performance-based compensation arrangements pursuant to written binding contracts in effect as of November 2, 2017 may continue to be treated as performance-based compensation and are deductible so long as the arrangements are not modified thereafter in any material respect ("162(m) Transition Relief"). 
We believe that PSU payouts for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods and Stock Option awards granted in 2017 and 2018 that are subject to award agreements entered into prior to November 2, 2017 and not subsequently materially modified, will continue to be deductible under the 162(m) Transition Relief. 
There can be no guarantee, however, that amounts potentially subject to the Section 162(m) Transition Relief limitations will be treated by the Internal Revenue Service as qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) Transition Relief or that such amounts will be deductible by the Company. As described above, a number of requirements must be met under Section 162(m) of the Code and the corresponding 162(m) Transition Relief in order for particular compensation to qualify for the exception. There can be no assurance that amounts intended to constitute "qualified performance-based" compensation under the 162(m) Transition Relief, including, if applicable, amounts payable under EIP or the Company's LTI program, will be fully deductible under all circumstances. In addition, the Company reserves the flexibility to award non-deductible compensation in circumstances where the Company believes, in its good faith business judgment, that such an award is in its best interest in attracting or retaining capable management. 
Equity Grant Practices 
The Company does not strategically time LTI awards in coordination with the release of material non-public information and has never had a practice of doing so. It is Company policy not to engage in backdating options. In addition, the Company has never timed and does not plan to time the release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. The accounting for PSU, RSU and Option awards granted by the Company is compliant with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and is disclosed in the Company's annual and quarterly financial reports filed with the SEC. The determination of grant date fair value for RSUs, PSUs and Options is described on page 44. 
"Double Trigger" Acceleration of Vesting Following Change in Control 
The Compensation Committee has approved terms and conditions for the executive officers' PSU awards that provide for double trigger vesting of awards upon a change in control—which means that the vesting of these awards will accelerate only upon certain terminations of employment following a change in control. For Internal Metric PSUs awarded in 2018, a change in control within the first twelve months of the performance period will result in conversion of the awards to time-based RSUs at target level that vest at the end of the performance period. The RSUs resulting from the conversion of Internal Metric PSUs will be subject to a double trigger for accelerated vesting. If a change in control occurs after the first twelve months of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will assess performance against the pre-established goals (adjusted for the reduced duration of the performance period) and the Internal Metric PSUs will be converted to time based RSUs that vest at the end of the performance period for that number of shares that would have become payable based on the goals (as adjusted) achieved through the date of the change in control. The RSUs resulting from the conversion of Internal Metric PSUs will be subject to a double trigger for accelerated vesting. 
For Relative TSR PSUs awarded in 2018, a change in control during the performance period will result in conversion of the awards to time-based RSUs that vest at the end of the performance period for that number of shares of Brink's Common stock that is equal to the number of Relative TSR PSUs that would have become payable based on the goals achieved through the date of the change in control. The RSUs resulting from the conversion of Relative TSR PSUs will be subject to a double trigger for accelerated vesting. 
For Performance Stock Option awards granted in 2018, in the event of a change in control prior to the vesting date, the stock price performance condition will be deemed achieved and the Options will be subject to a double trigger for accelerated vesting. 
The Brink's Company 
Benefits 
General. The types and amounts of benefits provided to the named executive officers are established based upon an assessment of competitive market factors and a determination of what is needed to attract and retain talent, as well as providing long-term financial security to the Company's employees and their families. The Company's primary benefits for the named executive officers include participation in the plans and arrangements listed below. 
Deferred Compensation. The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation program, the Key Employees' Deferred Compensation Program, for certain of its most highly compensated U.S.– based employees, including all of the named executive officers based in the U.S. Under the deferred compensation program, named executive officers may defer a portion of their compensation, which is invested in mutual funds or converted to units that track Brink's Common Stock, according to the executive's instructions at the time of enrollment. Matching contributions by the Company are made in the form of units of Brink's Common Stock, which are subject to a five-year vesting period from the date of original participation in the program. As a result, participation in the deferred compensation program enhances the alignment of the interests of the named executive officers with the Company's shareholders by providing the Company's executive officers with a further opportunity to meet or make progress against their stock ownership guidelines. The Compensation Committee also believes that the deferred compensation program furthers the Company's goal of retaining program participants, including the named executive officers, in part, because any matching contributions by the Company are subject to a five-year vesting period that begins at the time of enrollment in the program. Because he is not based in the U.S., Mr. Zukerman does not participate in this program. 
For more information on the Company's deferred compensation program, see "Non-qualified Deferred Compensation" beginning on page 55. 
Pension Plans 
The Company maintains a frozen noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering U.S. employees who met plan eligibility requirements and were employed before December 31, 2005. In addition, the Company maintains a frozen pension equalization plan under which the Company makes additional payments in excess of those payable under the Code limitations applicable to the pension plan. Mr. Marshall is the only named executive officer who participates in the Frozen Pension Plan and the Pension Equalization Plan. The accrual of benefits under these plans has been frozen since December 31, 2005. The Company also maintains pension plans in other countries in which it has operations. Mr. Zukerman participates in the Company's Switzerland Pension Plan which provides benefits to Switzerland-based employees. For more information on the Company's pension plans, see "Pension Benefits" beginning on page 53. 
Executive Salary Continuation Plan. The U.S.–based named executive officers participate along with other senior executives in the Company's Executive Salary Continuation Plan, which, in the event a participant dies while in the employment of the Company, provides that the Company will pay a designated beneficiary a death benefit equal to three times the participant's annual salary. This benefit is paid out over a 10-year period following the participant's death. Because he is not based in the U.S., Mr. Zukerman does not participate in this plan. 
Long-Term Disability Plan. U.S.-based named executive officers participate along with other salaried U.S. employees in a long-term disability program. In the event that the executive is totally incapacitated, he would receive 50% of current annual base salary plus the average of the last three years' annual incentive payments, with a maximum annual payment of $300,000. These payments would continue (as long as the executive is totally disabled) until the executive reaches the social security normal retirement age. Because he is not based in the U.S., Mr. Zukerman does not participate in this plan. 
Health and Welfare Plans. Messrs. Pertz, Domanico, Beech, and Marshall are also eligible to participate in the Company's health, dental and vision plans, and various insurance plans, including basic life insurance, and the Company's matching charitable gifts program on the same basis as any other salaried U.S. employee. 
Perquisites. For 2018, the Company provided its named executive officers with limited perquisites, including limited personal and spouse travel, entertainment and gifts, reimbursement of relocation expenses, executive physical examinations, and payment of certain tax preparation expenses for Mr. Zukerman. Executives bear all tax consequences and are not grossed up. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Severance Pay Plan 
The Severance Pay Plan provides severance benefits to eligible employees, including the named executive officers, whose employment is terminated by the Company without cause other than by reason of incapacity or terminated by the participant for good reason. A participant would not be entitled to severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan if the participant were otherwise eligible for more favorable severance benefits under another arrangement (including a Change in Control Agreement, see below) or in connection with a divestiture in which the participant is offered a comparable position. The Severance Pay Plan provides the following benefits to a participant if his or her employment is terminated under the circumstances described above: 
See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control"—Severance Pay Plan beginning on page 58 for additional information about the Severance Pay Plan. 
Change in Control Agreements 
The Company has change in control agreements with each of the named executive officers that are described under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control—Change in Control Agreements" beginning on page 61. The Compensation Committee believes that the change in control agreements serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders by ensuring that if a change in control is ever under consideration, the named executive officers will be able to advise the Board whether the potential change in control transaction is in the best interests of shareholders, without being unduly influenced by personal considerations, such as fear of the economic consequences of losing their jobs as a result of a change in control. The change in control agreements are "double trigger," which means that benefits become available to named executive officers under the agreements only upon a change in control followed by certain terminations of employment. The Compensation Committee believes that a double trigger appropriately protects the legitimate interests of the named executive officers in employment security without unduly burdening the Company or affecting shareholder value in connection with a change in control. The Compensation Committee reviews the potential payments under these agreements each year. 
The Brink's Company 
Compensation Recoupment Policy 
In the event the Company is required to provide an accounting restatement for any of the prior three fiscal years for which audited financial statements have been completed, due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, the Company will recoup from the executive officers and any recipient of performance-based cash or equity compensation who was directly responsible for the restatement, any performance-based cash or equity-based incentive compensation that they would not have been entitled to receive under the restated results. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Prohibition Against Hedging 
The Company maintains stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers in the amounts below: 
Shares of Brink's Common Stock owned outright, deferred compensation stock-based units and vested and unvested RSUs on an after-tax basis (but not unexercised stock options) are all eligible to be included for purposes of satisfying the guidelines. 
Unearned PSUs and unvested stock options do not count towards executive officers' guidelines. Until an executive officer meets his or her stock ownership guideline, the executive officer must hold at least 50% of any profit shares from stock option exercises, restricted stock unit vesting, or payout of any PSUs or Market Share Units. 
Executive officers are prohibited from engaging in any hedging transaction that could reduce or limit the officer's economic risk relative to his or her holdings, ownership or interest in Company securities. In addition, directors and executive officers are required to obtain approval to pledge Company securities.

(4)   For the Relative TSR PSUs, the grant date fair value was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on a Monte  Carlo simulation model. For the Internal Metric PSU and RSU awards, the grant date fair value was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on the stock price at the grant date and discounted because units do not receive or accrue  dividends during the vesting period. The stock price at the date of grant was based on the closing price per share of Brink's Common Stock on the respective grant dates, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. The actual value a named  executive officer may receive depends on achievement of pre-established program goals and market prices and there can be no assurance that the amounts reflected in the Stock Awards column will actually be  realized.

(7)   Amounts relate only to changes in pension value. The earning of benefits under the U.S. pension plans for all participants  was frozen as of December 31, 2005. These amounts represent the change during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 in the actuarial present value of Mr. Marshall's pension payouts due to a change in the assumptions  used to value pension benefits, not any change in the pension benefits earned by Mr. Marshall. For purposes of computing the actuarial present value of the accrued benefit payable to Mr. Marshall in the monthly benefit, the Company  assumed: (a) for 2018, a 3.7% discount rate for the frozen pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2017 and a 3.5% discount rate for the equalization plan measurement date of December 31, 2017 and a 4.4% discount rate for the  frozen pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2018 and a 4.3% discount rate for the equalization plan measurement date of December 31, 2018, for 2017, a 4.3% discount rate for the frozen pension plan measurement date of  December 31, 2016 and a 4.0% discount rate for the equalization plan measurement date of December 31, 2016 and a 3.7% discount rate for the frozen pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2017 and a 3.5% discount rate for the  equalization plan measurement date of December 31, 2017, and for 2016, a 4.5% discount rate for the frozen pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2015 and a 4.3% discount rate for the equalization plan measurement date of  December 31, 2015 and a 4.3% discount rate for the frozen pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2016 and a 4.0% discount rate for the equalization plan measurement date of December 31, 2016; (b) service accruals in the pension  plans are frozen as of December 31, 2005; and (c) payments will be made on a straight-life monthly annuity basis or pursuant to lump sum elections under the pension equalization plan. In 2018, the change in the actuarial present value of  Mr. Marshall's pension payouts was a decrease of $19,045. For a full description of the assumptions used by the Company for financial reporting purposes, see Note 4 to the Company's financial statements, which is included in the  Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. For a discussion of pension benefits, see "Pension  Benefits" beginning on page 53.

      For Mr. Zukerman, the amount represents the change during the year ended December 31, 2018 in the actuarial  present value of his pension payouts due to contributions during the year and changes in the assumptions used to value pension benefits. For purposes of computing the actuarial present value of the accrued benefit payable to Mr. Zukerman in the  monthly benefit, the Company assumed: (a) a 1.0% discount rate for the Switzerland pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2018 and a 0.7% discount rate for the Switzerland pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2017; and  (b) payments will be made on a straight-life monthly annuity basis. The following exchange rules were used to calculate the change in pension value during the year ended December 31, 2018: (i) 1 CHF = 1.0261 USD at December 31,  2017; and (ii) 1 CHF = 1.10191 USD at December 31, 2018.

The Brink's Company 
Realized Pay Table for 2018 
The table below provides supplemental disclosure representing the total direct compensation realized by each named executive officer for 2018. The Realized Pay Table below includes the salary paid in 2018, annual incentive payouts for the 2018 performance period paid in 2019, the value of PSUs for the 2016-2018 performance period that vested and were paid in shares of common stock in 2019, the value of RSUs that vested in 2018, and the gain on stock options exercised in 2018, as applicable. 
The Realized Pay Table differs substantially from the Summary Compensation Table on page 44 and is not a substitute for that table. The primary difference between the Realized Pay Table and the Summary Compensation Table is that the Realized Pay Table includes the payouts of PSUs after a three-year performance and/or vesting period while the SEC's calculation of total compensation, as shown in the Summary Compensation table, includes several items that are driven by accounting assumptions. For example, SEC rules require that the grant date fair value of all equity awards (such as PSUs and stock options) be reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the year in which they were granted. In some cases, the actual compensation realized by the named executive officers may be different than what is reported in the Summary Compensation Table and compensation reported may not be realized for a number of years, if at all. Furthermore, realized compensation for a named executive officer for any given year may be greater or less than the compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table for that year depending on fluctuations in stock prices on the grant and vesting dates, differences in equity grant values from year to year and SEC reporting requirements.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   The Internal Metric PSUs and Relative TSR PSUs granted to Messrs. Pertz, Domanico, Beech, Marshall and Zukerman were  granted on February 22, 2018 under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (see "Equity Award Grants" on page 48).  
(2)   Amounts in this column represent annual incentive targets under the EIP for 2018 paid in 2019. Payouts can range from 0%  to 200% of target. Actual payouts under the EIP are included in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 44.  
(3)   Amounts in this column represent Relative TSR PSUs awarded for the 2018-2020 performance measurement period. In 2021, the  Compensation Committee will determine the PSU payout based on the Company's Relative TSR compared to S&P MidCap 400 companies with foreign revenues that exceed 50% of total revenues, multiplied by the number of target units. The number of  TSR PSUs ultimately paid can range from 0% to 200% of the PSUs awarded. There is no minimum number of shares that will be paid under these awards. Because payment will be made in shares of Brink's Common Stock, the actual value of the earned  awards is based on the price of Brink's Common Stock at the time of payment.  
(4)   Amounts in this column represent Internal Metric PSUs awarded for the 2018-2020 performance measurement period. The  Compensation Committee will determine the performance of the Company against pre-established goals to determine payout of Internal Metric PSU awards, if any, in 2021. The number of Internal Metric PSUs  ultimately paid can range from 0% to 200% of the PSUs awarded. There is no minimum number of shares that will be paid under the Internal Metric PSU awards. Because payment will be made in shares of Brink's Common Stock, the actual value of the  earned awards is based on the price of Brink's Common Stock at the time of payment.  
(5)   In accordance with the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, the exercise price for the Options reported in this column was based on  the closing price of Brink's Common Stock on February 22, 2018, the date of the grant, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.  
(6)   For the Relative TSR PSUs and Options, the grant date fair value was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based  on a Monte Carlo simulation model. Under that model, the TSR PSU awards had a grant date fair value of $79.05 (February 22, 2018 grant date) per share and the Option awards for all named executive officers other than Mr. Pertz had a grant date  value of $17.92 per share. Option awards for Mr. Pertz had grant date fair values of $17.92 (for the awards with a performance condition of 25% stock price appreciation) and $15.23 (for the awards with a performance condition of 50% stock price  appreciation). For Internal Metric PSU awards and RSU awards, the grant date fair value was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on the stock price at the grant date and discounted because units do not receive or accrue dividends  during the vesting period. Accordingly, for the 2018 Internal Metric PSU awards, which vest at the end of a three-year service period, the grant date fair value was $71.71 per share. For the RSU awards, which vest ratably over a three-year service  period, the weighted average grant date fair value was $72.28 per share.  
(7)   Mr. Marshall was no longer serving as an executive officer as of January 1, 2019. As a result, these awards have  been forfeited, except for a portion of the RSUs awarded in 2018, which vested in February 2019.

The Brink's Company 
Equity Award Grants 
The 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Company's shareholders in May 2017, is designed to provide an additional incentive for the officers and employees who are key to the Company's success. The Compensation Committee administers the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, is authorized to select key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to participate in the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and has the sole discretion to grant eligible participants equity awards, including options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, other stock-based awards, cash awards, or any combination thereof. 
The exercise price of any stock option, the grant price of any stock appreciation right, and the purchase price of any security that may be purchased under any other stock-based award may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock or other security on the date of the grant of the option, right or award. Under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, determinations of the fair market value of shares of Brink's Common Stock are based on the closing price on the grant date and determinations of fair market value with respect to other instruments are made in accordance with methods or procedures established by the Compensation Committee. 
PSU awards granted under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan have specific terms and conditions approved by the Compensation Committee. In general, PSUs are canceled following termination of employment. Upon termination of employment by reason of the holder's retirement or permanent and total disability, PSUs remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with their terms. In the event of the holder's death while employed, the holder's beneficiary will be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion of the number of shares that would have been payable under PSU awards notwithstanding the holder's death, based on the number of days in the performance period that elapsed prior to termination. For a description of the treatment of PSU awards upon change in control, see page 39. 
For a discussion of the principles applied in administering the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2018 Compensation Decisions by Component—Long-Term Incentive Compensation—Equity Awards under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan" beginning on page 36. 
2017 Performance Share Unit Awards 
In 2017, named executive officers received awards of both Internal Metric PSUs and Relative TSR PSUs, which are reported as equity incentive plan awards in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards. The grant date fair value of the Internal Metric PSUs was determined using the closing price of Brink's Common Stock on the respective grant dates, discounted for the value of dividends not received during the vesting period. These awards will be settled in shares of Brink's Common Stock based on the number of Internal Metric PSU awards originally granted multiplied by the performance achievement percentage of the pre-established non-GAAP operating profit performance goal. Failure to achieve the pre-established minimum threshold financial goal would result in no payout being made under these awards. A payout for performance less than target may be made provided that a significant portion of the performance target was achieved. As a result, the payout percentage of Internal Metric PSU awards ranges from 0% to 200%, based on performance against the pre-established goals. 
Relative TSR PSUs have a market condition, as defined under ASC Topic 718, in addition to their performance condition. Accordingly, the grant date fair value of these awards was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. These awards will be settled in shares of Brink's Common Stock based on the number of Relative TSR PSU awards originally granted multiplied by the performance achievement percentage of the relative TSR goal versus the S&P Mid Cap 400 companies with foreign revenues that exceed 50% of total revenues. Failure to achieve the pre-established minimum threshold Relative TSR goal would result in no payout being made under the Relative TSR PSU awards. A payout for performance less than target may be made provided that a significant portion of the Relative TSR performance target was achieved. As a result, the payout percentage of Relative TSR PSU awards ranges from 0% to 200%, based on performance against the pre-established Relative TSR among the comparator companies. 
Performance Stock Options 
Performance Stock Options were granted in 2018 and are reported as equity incentive plan awards in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table above. The grant date fair value of the Performance Stock Options was determined using a Monte Carlo 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
simulation model. The Performance Stock Options awarded to all executive officers other than Mr. Pertz: (1) vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date only if the average closing price of the Company's common stock during any 15 day period between the grant date and the three year anniversary of the grant date is 125% of the closing price on the grant date; and (2) expire six years after the date of grant. Two types of Performance Stock Options were awarded to Mr. Pertz in 2018. Half of the Performance Stock Options awarded vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date only if the average closing price of the Company's common stock during any 15 day period between the grant date and the three year anniversary of the grant date is 125% of the closing price on the grant date. The other half of Performance Stock Options awarded to Mr. Pertz in 2018 vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date only if the average closing price of the Company's common stock during any 15 day period between the grant date and the three year anniversary of the grant date is 150% of the closing price on the grant date. All of the Performance Stock Options awarded to Mr. Pertz in 2018 expire six years after the date of grant. With respect to all of the Performance Stock Options, upon a change in control, the price targets applicable to the Performance Stock Options awards cease to apply. In addition, if the awards do not remain outstanding or the successor company does not assume the award or provide a substitute, then the price targets shall be deemed achieved and the awards shall vest in full upon change in control. In the event of termination following change in control (other than termination by the company for cause or by the employee without good reason), then the award will vest in full without regard to the price targets.

Outstanding Equity Awards Table Narrative 
For lnternal Metric PSUs awarded in 2016 and 2017, a change in control within the first twelve months of the performance period will result in a conversion of the awards to time-based RSUs at target level that vest on the vesting date (as set forth in the award agreement). lf a change in control occurs after the first twelve months of, but prior to the end of the performance period, the award will convert into time-based RSUs that vest on the vesting date for that number of shares of Brink's Common Stock that would have become payable based on the goals achieved (adjusted for the shortened performance period) through the date of the change in control. lf a change in control occurs after the end of the performance period but prior to the vesting date, the award will become payable on the vesting date. 
For Relative TSR PSUs awarded in 2016 and 2017, a change in control during the performance period will result in a conversion of the awards to time-based RSUs that vest on the vesting date for that number of shares that would have become payable based on the goals achieved through the date of the change in control. lf a change in control occurs after the end of the performance period but prior to the vesting date, the award will become payable on the vesting date. For Performance Stock Options, if a change of control occurs prior to the vesting date, the price target shall cease to apply and, in the event the named executive officer is terminated without cause or for good reason, then the award will vest in full without regard to the price target.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Pension Benefits 
The Company provides retirement benefits to U.S. employees who worked for the Company or one of its participating subsidiaries before December 31, 2005 and who meet vesting and other minimum requirements. These benefits are provided through the following plans: The Brink's Company Frozen Pension Plan (the "Frozen Pension Plan"), a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code, and The Brink's Company Pension Equalization Plan (the "Equalization Plan"), a plan (not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code) under which the Company makes additional payments to a smaller group of employees so that the total amount to be received by each participant from both plans will be the same as he or she would have received under the Frozen Pension Plan in the absence of benefit limitations for tax qualified plans. (The Frozen Pension Plan and the Equalization Plan, described below, are referred to collectively in this proxy statement as the pension plans.) Mr. Marshall is the only named executive officer who is covered by these plans. Benefit accruals under the pension plans were frozen for all employees as of December 31, 2005 and no additional pension benefits have been earned since that date. 
Mr. Zukerman participates in the Brink's Switzerland Pension Plan (The "Swiss Pension Plan"), which is discussed below. Mr. Zukerman is the only named executive officer who is covered by this plan. 
The following table presents information as of December 31, 2018 concerning each defined benefit plan of the Company that provides for payments to be made to the named executive officers at, following or in connection with retirement. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Zukerman are the only named executive officers listed in the table below because they are the only named executive officers who participate in any pension plans.

(1)   This column shows the present value of the accumulated benefit as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018,  the related hypothetical accumulated benefit payable to Mr. Marshall's beneficiary following death would have been $78,305 for the Frozen Pension Plan and $2,865 for the Pension Equalization Plan.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of computing the present value of the accrued benefit payable to Mr. Marshall, the Company used the following assumptions: (a) the retirement age is the earliest one (age 65) permitted under the pension plans without a reduction in the monthly benefit; (b) a 4.40% discount rate for the Frozen Pension Plan measurement date of December 31, 2018; (c) a 4.30% discount rate for the equalization plan measurement date of December 31, 2018; (d) service accruals in the pension plans are frozen as of December 31, 2005; and (e) payments will be made on a straight-life monthly annuity basis. These assumptions are the same as are used to value the Company's pension obligations in the financial statements as of December 31, 2018. For a full description of the assumptions used by the Company for financial reporting purposes, see Note 4 to the Company's financial statements, which is included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. In addition, the Company has assumed Mr. Marshall will attain the age of 65. For 2018, longevity was determined using the Mercer modified RP-2014 base mortality table and Mercer modified MP-2018 projection scale, with blue collar adjustments for frozen pension plan calculations and white collar adjustments for annuity payment calculations for the equalization plan and the GATT 2003 mortality table for lump sum calculations for the equalization plan. 
For purposes of computing the present value of the accrued benefit payable to Mr. Zukerman, the Company used the following assumptions: (a) the retirement age is the earliest one (age 65 for males) permitted under the pension plan; (b) a 0.7% discount rate for the pension plan measurement date of December 31, 2018 and (c) payments will be made on a straight-life monthly annuity basis. These assumptions are the same as are used to value the 
The Brink's Company 
Company's pension obligations in the financial statements as of December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company has assumed Mr. Zukerman will attain the age of 65; longevity is determined using the LPP/BVG2015-Generational mortality table for payment calculations. 
Brink's Switzerland Pension Plan 
The Company maintains the Swiss Pension Plan, which is a contribution-based plan that covers all Switzerland employees, with a guarantee of a minimum interest credit and fixed conversion rates at retirement. 
The amount financed for the benefit payable to an employee is based on a percentage of the insured salary and depends on the age attained of the member; 10% from age 25, 13% from age 35, 16% from age 45 and 20% from age 55. The financing is split between the employee (40% of total cost) and the employer (60% of total cost). The risk benefits are expressed as a percentage of the participant's salary, which annual cost is also split between the employee (40% of total cost) and the employer (60% of total cost). 
Subject to certain limitations, an employee who retires before he or she reaches age 65, provided he or she has reached the age of 58, may receive an annuity for life payable on a monthly basis beginning on his or her early retirement date at an annual rate not to exceed the maximum possible old-age savings tables which are based on a percentage of the participant's salary. 
The plan provides for payment options of an annuity for life or as a lump sum payment. Benefit elections must be made before retirement and are subject to certain requirements, such as spousal consent. 
U.S. Frozen Pension Plan 
The amount of any benefit payable to a participant in the Frozen Pension Plan is based on the participant's benefit accrual service and average salary (as these terms are defined in the Frozen Pension Plan). 
Subject to certain limitations, a participant who reaches age 65 may receive an annuity for life payable monthly beginning on his or her normal retirement date (as defined in the Frozen Pension Plan) at an annual rate equal to the sum of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       service completed as of May 31, 2003 with a maximum of 25 years; plus  
[END TABLE]
Subject to certain limitations, a participant who retires before he or she reaches age 65, provided he or she has completed 10 years of vesting service and reached age 55, may receive an annuity for life payable monthly beginning on his or her early retirement date (as defined in the Frozen Pension Plan) at an annual rate equal to the rate applicable to retirement on his or her normal retirement at age 65 reduced by 0.4167% for each month (the equivalent of 5% per year) by which his or her early retirement date precedes the normal retirement date. 
The Frozen Pension Plan provides multiple payment options for participants. Participants may select a single life annuity for the life of the participant, joint and survivor annuities under which a participant's surviving beneficiary may receive for his or her life 50%, 75% or 100% of the monthly benefit received by the participant, and period certain options under 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
which a participant's surviving beneficiary may receive payments for a fixed term of 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. If a joint and survivor annuity or a period certain option is selected, the amount of the retirement benefit is less than the amount payable under a single life annuity. Benefit elections must be made before retirement, and some options are subject to certain requirements, such as spousal consent. 
Pension Equalization Plan 
The Code limits the amount of pension benefits that may be paid under federal income tax qualified plans. As a result, the Board adopted the Equalization Plan under which the Company will make additional payments so that the total amount received by each person affected by the Code limitations is the same as would have otherwise been received under the Frozen Pension Plan (formerly known as the Pension-Retirement Plan). The Company has reserved the right to terminate or amend the Equalization Plan at any time 
Effective December 1, 1997, the Equalization Plan was amended to permit participants to receive the actuarial equivalent of their benefit under such plan in a lump sum upon retirement (subject to certain limitations on distribution imposed by Section 409A of the Code). In accordance with the Equalization Plan, the Company has contributed to a trust, established between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., amounts in cash to provide the benefits to which (1) participants under the Equalization Plan and (2) retirees covered under certain employment contracts are entitled under the terms of the equalization plan and such employment contracts. None of the named executive officers is covered by the contracts referred to in clause (2) above. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. 
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation 
The following table presents information about the Company's deferred compensation program, which provides for the deferral of compensation paid to or earned by the named executive officers on a basis that is not tax qualified (i.e., the Company is not entitled to take a tax deduction for the related expense until payments are actually made to the participants). Mr. Zukerman does not participate in the deferred compensation program because he does not reside in the United States. 
The information included in the table below reflects elective deferrals, Company matching contributions, dividends credited to the participants' accounts during 2018, aggregate withdrawals and the aggregate balance of deferred compensation accounts at December 31, 2018. Because deferrals, along with any matching contributions, related to annual incentive payouts under the EIP or the prior annual incentive plan, the Key Employees Incentive Plan ("KEIP"), are credited in the year after they are earned, these amounts differ from the annual incentive payments in the Summary Compensation Table, which, for each year, reflect amounts earned in that year.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Key Employees' Deferred Compensation Program 
Deferrals 
The Company's deferred compensation program is an unfunded plan that provides deferred compensation for a select group of the Company's management, including the named executive officers. Under the deferred compensation program, a named executive officer is permitted to defer receipt of: 
The Company provides matching contributions for deferred cash incentive amounts (100% of the first 10% deferred) and deferred salary (100% of the first 10% deferred). An executive may elect to defer additional amounts under the supplemental savings plan after he or she meets the maximum permitted under the company's 401(k) Plan. The company provides matching contributions to supplemental savings plan contributions. For 2018, matching contributions were equal to 100% of the first 2.0% of salary and annual incentive deferrals, less amounts deferred into the Company's 401(k) Plan. 
Amounts deferred are invested in mutual funds or converted to units that track Brink's Common Stock, per the executive's instructions at the time of annual enrollment. Matching contributions by the Company are made in the form of units of Brink's Common Stock, which are subject to a five-year vesting period from the original participation in the deferred compensation program. The dollar values are converted in accordance with the formula in the program. 
Dividends paid with respect to the common stock units in a participant's account are converted to units that track Brink's Common Stock. 
Distributions 
General. The deferred compensation program provides for distributions of one share of Brink's Common Stock for each common stock unit in a participant's account. Cash is paid for deferred compensation invested in mutual funds, and in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of Brink's Common Stock. 
Termination Upon Death, Retirement, Disability or Change in Control. Upon the termination of participation as a result of death, retirement, total and permanent disability or termination for any reason within three years following a change in control, lump-sum distributions for all accrued units are made under the deferred compensation program six months after termination of employment. A participant may elect, however, to receive the shares in up to five equal annual installments beginning after the last day of the sixth month following the fifth anniversary of the date of termination. 
Termination Other Than Upon Death, Retirement, Disability or Change in Control. In the event that a participant's employment terminates for a reason not described above, the participant receives the contributions made by the participant, related dividends and changes in market value. The participant forfeits all common stock units attributable to matching contributions and related dividends for the year in which the termination occurs and the common stock units attributable to matching contributions and related dividends that are otherwise unvested. If a participant's employment is terminated for ''cause,'' the participant forfeits all common stock units attributable to matching contributions and related dividends credited to the participant's account under the program whether or not vested. A participant's common stock units attributable to Company matching contributions and related dividends vest based on the number of months since the executive's original participation in the deferred compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Less than 36 months      0%  
 At least 36 months but less than 48 months      50%  
 At least 48 months and less than 60 months      75%  
 60 months or more      100%  
[END TABLE]
The Brink's Company 
As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Pertz and Domanico were 0% vested. Messrs. Beech and Marshall were fully vested. 
Lump-sum distributions are made at a date selected by the participant at least two years following the date of election or six months after termination of employment. A participant may elect, however, to receive the shares in up to five equal annual installments beginning on a date selected by the participant at least two years following the year of election. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
None of the Company's named executive officers have employment agreements with the Company, however, each named executive officer may be eligible to receive benefits and payments pursuant to the Company's Severance Pay Plan and individual change in control agreements in the event of termination or change in control. Benefits under change in control agreements are triggered upon termination following change in control ("double trigger"). The tables on pages 60 and 64 show the estimated amount of incremental additional benefits and payments that would be paid to each of the named executive officers if their employment terminated on December 31, 2018 to the extent those benefits and payments exceed amounts that would be due to the named executive officers regardless of the reason for termination of employment, including: 
Because the named executive officers would be eligible to receive different benefits and payments depending on whether a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018, information about the additional benefits and payments that would be paid to each named executive officer in connection with a termination of employment is presented in two tables: one without a change in control and one with a change in control. Following are descriptions of the types of benefits and payments that the named executive officers would be eligible to receive under various termination scenarios, key terms under the change in control agreements, and the categories of benefits and payments as reflected in the tables on pages 60 and 64. Neither the tables below, nor the descriptions accompanying them, include hypothetical benefits and payments to named executive officers under a retirement scenario because none of the named executive officers were eligible for retirement as of December 31, 2018 and were therefore not eligible for any additional benefits or payments under that scenario. 
Severance Pay Plan 
Upon a qualifying termination, participants who are named executive officers would be eligible to receive the following benefits: 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
In order to receive severance payments, the participant must execute a separation and release agreement that includes a release of claims in favor of the Company as well as confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition restrictions that remain in effect for a period of 12 months after termination of employment (18 months for the Chief Executive Officer). 
The Committee may amend or terminate the Severance Pay Plan at any time, but any action that would reduce the payments or benefits to participants, narrow the conditions for a qualifying termination, or otherwise reduce the protections provided to participants would not be effective until 12 months following approval by the Committee. 
Hypothetical Post-Employment Payments and Benefits to Named Executive Officers Without a Change in Control 
The table on page 60 provides information with respect to incremental additional hypothetical benefits and payments to the named executive officers as of December 31, 2018 under the Company's policies and programs, assuming their employment was terminated without a change in control.

Unvested RSUs are valued based on the number of unvested  units multiplied by the closing price of Brink's Common Stock at December 31, 2018. Unvested Relative TSR PSUs and Internal Metric PSUs, are valued in accordance with plan terms, based on the number of unvested units multiplied by the  closing price of Brink's Common Stock at December 31, 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Hypothetical Termination Benefits Following Termination Upon a Change in Control 
Change in Control Agreements 
The change in control agreements provide certain compensation and continued benefits in the event that a "change in control" occurs. 
In addition, these agreements provide additional benefits and payments in the event that a change in control occurs and either the executive is terminated by the Company other than for ''cause'' or incapacity or he resigns for ''good reason'' within two years following a change in control. Each named executive officer is a party to a change in control agreement with the Company with principal terms as described below. The executive's entitlement to benefits under the agreement requires compliance with certain non-competition provisions. 
Change in Control Agreements—Definitions of Key Terms 
The change in control agreements generally define "cause," "change in control" and "good reason" as follows: 
For Mr. Pertz, "good reason" means any of the following events that is not cured by the Company within 30 days after written notice thereof from Mr. Pertz to the Company, which written notice must be made within 90 days of the occurrence of the event: 
The Brink's Company 
Change in Control Agreements–Benefits Following a Change in Control if Executive is not Terminated 
Salary and Annual Incentive. During the first two years of employment following a change in control, each executive who is a party to a change in control agreement will receive annual compensation at least equal to the sum of (1) a salary not less than the executive's annualized salary in effect immediately before the change in control occurred, plus (2) a bonus not less than the amount of the executive's average annual incentive award for the last three years preceding the date the change in control occurred. In the event the executive has not been employed with the Company for the last three years, the executive's target annual incentive will be used for any partial or complete year as necessary to determine the three year average. 
Incentive, Savings and Retirement Plans. During the executive's continued employment, the executive is entitled to continue to participate in all available incentive and savings plans and programs offered by the Company. 
Welfare Benefit Plans. During the executive's continued employment, the executive and/or the executive's family or beneficiary, as the case may be, is eligible to participate in and will receive all benefits under generally available welfare benefit plans and programs offered by the Company. 
Change in Control Agreements–Termination Benefits Following a Change in Control 
Termination for Good Reason or for Reasons Other Than for Cause, Death or Incapacity. 
Under this scenario: 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Termination for Death or Incapacity. If an executive's employment is terminated by reason of the executive's death or incapacity following the date of the change in control, the change in control agreement will terminate without further obligations to the executive's legal representatives, other than for (1) the payment of the Accrued Obligation Payment and (2) the provision by the Company of death benefits or disability benefits, respectively, in accordance with the Company's welfare benefit plans and programs applicable to full-time officers or employees of the Company as in effect on the date of the change in control or, if more favorable to the executive, at the executive's deemed date of termination. 
Termination for Cause. If the Company or its successor terminates an executive's employment for cause following the date of the change in control, the change in control agreement will terminate without further obligations to the executive other than payment of (1) a lump sum payment of the executive's currently effective annual base salary through the date of termination and (2) Other Benefits, in each case to the extent not already paid or credited. 
Termination Other Than for Good Reason. If an executive voluntarily terminates employment following the date of the change in control, excluding a termination for good reason, the change in control agreement will terminate without further obligations to the executive, other than for the lump sum payment of the Accrued Obligation Payment (with the exception of any pro-rated annual incentive) and Other Benefits. 
Excise Tax Cutback. If the amounts payable to an executive under the change in control agreement trigger payment of an excise tax, an accounting firm designated by the Company prior to the change in control will determine the after-tax benefit to the executive: (1) with the full payment of amounts due and payment by the executive of any resulting excise tax; and (2) after reducing the payment benefits to the extent necessary to avoid triggering the excise tax liability. The executive will be paid the amount that produces the greater after-tax benefit and any excise tax will be paid by the executive. 
Hypothetical Post-Employment Payments and Benefits to Named Executive Officers Upon a Change in Control 
The table on page 64 provides information with respect to the incremental additional benefits and payments to the named executive officers as of December 31, 2018 under the scenarios covered by the change in control agreements described above and the Company's policies and programs assuming their employment is terminated following a change in control.

Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are required to disclose the median annual total compensation of all of the Company's employees, the total compensation of the Company's chief executive officer, and the ratio of these two amounts. In accordance with Instruction 2 of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we used the same median employee from our 2017 pay ratio calculation disclosed in our 2018 proxy statement for our 2018 pay ratio calculation because we reasonably believe that there has been no change in our employee population and employee compensation arrangements that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. The methodology that we used and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used to identify the median employee in 2017, the first year we disclosed our pay ratio calculation, and then determine annual total compensation for 2018 were as follows: 
In determining the median total compensation of all employees, we prepared a list of all employees as of December 31, 2017 and the taxable wages (determined in accordance with local laws in each jurisdiction in which the Company's employees are employed) for each employee for 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. 2017 taxable wages were annualized for any employees who joined the Company after January 1, 2017. We excluded all 81 of our employees based in Germany from our calculation of the median employee under the de minimis exception. Without applying the de minimis exception, the Company had 58,139 employees. With this exception, we had a total of 58,058 employees as of December 31, 2017. This total also excludes an aggregate 2,670 employees who joined Brink's during 2017 as a result of acquisitions (including 670 employees in Brazil as a result of our acquisition of Muitofacil Holding Ltda. and its subsidiary, Muitofacil Arrecadacao e Recebimento Ltda., 267 employees in Chile as a result of our acquisition of Global Security S.A., 1,245 employees in Argentina as a result of our acquisitions of Maco Transportadora de Caudales S.A. and Maco Litoral S.A. and 488 employees in France as a result of our acquisition of Temis S.A.S. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries). We then identified the median total compensation among the list of taxable wages for these 58,058 employees. In determining the median total compensation of all employees, we did not make any cost of living adjustments to the wages paid to any employee outside of the U.S. 
As set forth in the table below, our chief executive officer to global median employee pay ratio is 872:1 for 2018. As described in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, the Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews and approves target compensation for the Company's Chief Executive Officer, taking into account relevant market data and the executive's performance and expected future contributions to the Company. In 2018, approximately 90% of the CEO's target compensation was performance-based, at-risk compensation to be paid based on the Company's performance against pre-approved targets. Compensation for employees other than the Company's senior executives, including the median employee, are determined by local management, taking into account relevant market data for that geography, criticality of the employee's role, and the employee's performance and expected future contributions to the Company.

Given that 88% of the Company's employees are located outside of the U.S., mostly in lower wage geographies, and that a vast majority of the positions are hourly direct labor, many of whom are temporary or seasonal employees, whose compensation is not annualized per the SEC rules, the compensation of our median global employee (who is employed outside of the U.S.) is significantly lower than our U.S. employee base, which leads to a higher global chief executive officer pay ratio. 
In light of the significant percentage of employees located outside of the U.S., we also conducted a review of the 2017 taxable wages employees in the U.S. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. 2017 taxable wages were annualized for any employees who joined the Company after January 1, 2017. We then identified the median total compensation among the list of taxable wages for these 7,042 employees. The 2017 median U.S. employee's total annual compensation for 2018 was $40,212 and the ratio of the chief executive officer to the median U.S. employee's total annual compensation was 258:1. 
The pay ratios included in this information are reasonable estimates, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their ratio, the estimated CEO pay ratio information provided herein should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.

*  The amounts in the table above reflect changes to the director compensation program approved by the Board of Directors in  May 2018. In 2018, upon recommendation from the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and in consultation with the independent compensation consultant, the Board of Directors approved:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Committee holds more than five additional meetings (other than those planned for the year for each of the Board or its Committees) in the amount of $1,750 per  in-person meeting and $1,500 per telephonic meeting.  
[END TABLE]
These changes were approved in order to better align the director compensation program with market levels of director compensation. 
Director Equity Plans 
Under the terms of the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (approved by shareholders in May 2017), directors received equity awards, including the annual grant of Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs"). Pursuant to the terms of the plan, the Board may grant non-employee directors equity awards, including options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-
 based awards or any combination thereof. The exercise price of any stock option, the grant price of any stock appreciation right, and the purchase price of any security that may be purchased under any other stock-based award may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock or other security on the date of the grant of the option, right or award. 
The Brink's Company 
Under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, determinations of the fair market value of shares of Brink's Common Stock are based on the closing price on the grant date and determinations of fair market value with respect to other instruments are made in accordance with methods or procedures approved by the Committee. 
In 2018, directors received grants of DSUs that vest and will be settled in Brink's Common Stock on a one-for-one basis on the first anniversary of the grant date. In general, DSUs are forfeited if a director leaves before the vesting date. The Chairman of the Board receives a portion of his annual fee in the form of Brink's Common Stock and certain directors elected to receive all or a portion of their 2018 annual retainers and/or fees in the form of Brink's Common Stock. More information about Common Stock held by directors appears under "Stock Ownership" on page 71. 
Stock Ownership Guideline 
Non-employee directors are required to meet a stock ownership guideline of five times the annual retainer. Until a director has met the ownership guideline, he or she must hold at least 50% of any profit shares acquired through a stock option exercise or stock grant vesting. The Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews directors' compliance with the guideline. Shares counted towards the ownership guideline include Brink's Common Stock, deferred stock units, shares of restricted stock, and unvested and vested restricted stock units, but not unexercised stock options. 
Plan for Deferral of Directors' Fees 
Under the Plan for Deferral of Directors' Fees (the "Deferral Plan"), a director may elect to defer receipt of his or her cash retainer, fees, and/or dividend equivalent payments (for equity awards prior to 2017) to future years, into one or more investment options, in amounts between 10% and 100%. Distributions from a director's account, which may be made before or after a director ceases to be a member of the Board, generally will be made in a single lump sum distribution; however, a director may elect, in accordance with the Deferral Plan, to receive a distribution in up to ten equal annual installments. Under the Deferral Plan a director may also elect to defer equity awards, including DSUs and retainer fees elected to be paid in shares of Brink's common stock. Distributions of deferred equity awards will be made in a single lump sum distribution of Brink's Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. Directors may elect to have these deferred equity awards distributed on a specified date, or after their separation from service on the Board. 
Business Travel Accident Insurance Plan 
The Company provides directors with insurance benefits payable in the event of their death, dismemberment, loss of sight, speech, hearing or permanent and total disability if the loss occurs as a result of an accident while the director is traveling on Company business.

PROPOSAL NO. 3—APPROVAL OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has, subject to shareholder approval, selected Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and the Board recommends approval of such selection by the shareholders. One or more representatives of Deloitte are expected to attend the annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the selection, evaluation, compensation (including negotiation of fees), retention and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In order to assure the continued independence of the firm, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee, led by its Chair, is directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner. The members of the Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of Deloitte to serve as the Company's independent registered accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its investors. 
As reported on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, dated January 20, 2017, the Audit Committee approved the dismissal of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent registered public accountant, effective as of the date of KPMG's completion of the audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 and the filing of the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K. 
The reports of KPMG on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. 
During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and through February 23, 2017, (i) there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
On January 24, 2017, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. During the Company's fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, and through February 23, 2017, neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted Deloitte regarding either (i) application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Deloitte that Deloitte concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
PROPOSAL NO. 3—APPROVAL OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Principal Accounting Fees and Services 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed by Deloitte, our independent registered public accounting firms for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 3,529      $ 4,081   
 Audit-Related Fees      371        136   
 Tax Fees      265        119   
 All Other Fees      35        28   
 Total Fees    $ 4,200      $ 4,364   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees are primarily for professional services provided in connection with the audit of the Company's financial statements and review of quarterly consolidated financial statements (including the audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and audit services provided in connection with other statutory or regulatory filings. 
Audit-Related Fees primarily include fees for assurance services that are reasonably related to the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and for services in connection with audits of the Company's pension and other employee benefit plans. 
Tax Fees primarily include fees associated with tax compliance and tax advice, as well as domestic and international tax planning. This category also includes tax planning on mergers and acquisitions and restructurings, as well as other services related to tax disclosure and filing requirements. 
All Other Fees are for services provided to the Company not otherwise included in the categories above. 
Consideration of Auditor Independence 
The Audit Committee has concluded that the provision of the non-audit services by Deloitte was compatible with maintaining Deloitte's independence. 
Procedures for Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services 
The Audit Committee has adopted written procedures for pre-approving audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The pre-approved services are described in detail under three categories: audit and audit-related, tax services and agreed upon procedures. Requests for services are reviewed by the members of the Company's Legal and Finance Departments to ensure that they satisfy the requirements of the pre-approval policy. The Audit Committee is provided a detailed update of these audit and non-audit engagements at each regular meeting. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE 
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE SELECTION 
OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. 
The Brink's Company 
AUDIT AND ETHICS COMMITTEE REPORT 
In accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as required by the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and the rules of the SEC. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee met nine times, and the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the financial information contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, interim financial information contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and discussed press releases announcing earnings with the Company's Chief Financial Officer and the independent registered public accounting firm prior to public release. 
The Audit Committee members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management or the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Company's management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an integrated audit of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
In connection with the responsibilities set forth in its charter, the Audit Committee has: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with management  and Deloitte, the Company's independent auditors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by the Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with  Audit Committees, which superseded the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board regarding Deloitte's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Deloitte its independence.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee also considered, as it determined appropriate, tax matters and other areas of financial reporting and the audit process over which the Audit Committee has oversight. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

APPENDIX A 
Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
This proxy statement refers to non-GAAP revenue, operating profit and earnings per share, which are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The purpose of the non-GAAP results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance.

(b)  Our U.S. retirement plans are frozen and costs related to these plans are excluded from  non-GAAP results. Certain non-U.S. operations also have retirement plans. Settlement charges related to these non-U.S. plans are  also excluded from non-GAAP results.

(c)  Represents the impact of tax legislation enacted into law in the fourth quarter of 2017. This primarily relates to  the U.S. Tax Reform expense from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets.

(d)  Effective June 30, 2018, we deconsolidated our investment in Venezuelan subsidiaries and recognized a pretax charge  of $126.7 million. Post-deconsolidation funding of ongoing costs related to our Venezuelan operations was $0.6 million and was expensed as incurred and reported in interest and other nonoperating income (expense). We do not expect future  amounts to be material.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(e)  Because we reported a loss from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in 2018, GAAP EPS was calculated using basic shares.  However, as we reported income from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis in 2018, non-GAAP EPS was calculated using diluted shares.

Other Items Not Allocated To Segments (Unaudited) 
The Brink's Company and subsidiaries 
Brink's measures its segment results before income and expenses for corporate activities and for certain other items. See below for a summary of the other items not allocated to segments. 
Venezuela operations Prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective June 30, 2018, we excluded from our segment results all of our Venezuela operating results, due to the Venezuelan government's restrictions that have prevented us from repatriating funds. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer, the Company's Chief Operating Decision maker ("CODM"), has assessed segment performance and has made resource decisions by segment excluding Venezuela operating results. 
Reorganization and Restructuring 
2016 Restructuring 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions. As a result of these actions, we recognized charges of $18.1 million in 2016, an additional $17.3 million in 2017 and $13.0 million in 2018. The actions under this program were substantially completed in 2018, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $48 million. 
Other Restructurings 
Management periodically implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business. As a result of these actions, we recognized charges of $4.6 million in 2017 and $7.6 million in 2018, primarily severance costs. For the current restructuring actions, we expect to incur additional costs of up to $7 million in future periods. 
Due to the unique circumstances around these charges, they have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non-GAAP results. 
Acquisitions and dispositions Certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non-GAAP results. These items are described below: 
2018 Acquisitions and Dispositions 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets was $17.7 million in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Integration costs in 2018 related to acquisitions in France and the U.S. were $8.1 million.

• Amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets was $8.4 million in 2017.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transaction costs were $2.6 million related to acquisitions of new businesses in 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Currency transaction gains of $1.8 million were recognized in 2017 related to acquisition activity.   
[END TABLE]
Argentina highly inflationary impact Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, we designated Argentina's economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. As a result, Argentine peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are now remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate then in effect, with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings. In addition, nonmonetary assets retain a higher historical basis when the currency is devalued. The higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when the nonmonetary assets are consumed. In the second half of 2018, we recognized $8.0 million in pretax charges related to highly inflationary accounting, including currency remeasurement losses of $6.2 million. 
Reporting compliance Certain third party costs incurred related to the implementation and adoption of ASU 2016-02, the new lease accounting standard effective for us January 1, 2019 ($2.7 million), and the mitigation of material weaknesses ($1.8 million) are excluded from non-GAAP results.
