PROXY STATEMENT
Dated March 19, 2019 (unless otherwise noted)
GENERAL INFORMATION
This Proxy Statement is being sent to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the 2019 annual general and special meeting of shareholders (the "Meeting") by the management of Oculus VisionTech Inc. ("Oculus") to be held at the offices of Oculus, #507, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 3N6, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on April 30, 2019, and at any adjournments thereof. This proxy statement and the accompanying Notice of 2019 Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders and Form of Proxy were first mailed to stockholders on or about March 26, 2019. Shareholders are encouraged to review the information provided in this Proxy Statement in conjunction with our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.
Who may vote
Only our shareholders as recorded in our stock register at the close of business on March 18, 2019 (the "Record Date") may vote at the Meeting. At the close of business on the Record Date, we had 45,572,568 common shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Each common share is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the Meeting.
How to vote
You may vote in person at the meeting or by proxy. We recommend that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Meeting. You can always change your vote at the Meeting.
Voting Electronically via the Internet 
If your shares are registered in the name of a bank or brokerage you may be eligible to vote your shares electronically over the Internet or by telephone. A large number of banks and brokerage firms are participating in the Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") online program, which provides eligible shareholders who receive a paper copy of the Proxy Statement with the opportunity to vote via the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm is participating in Broadridge's program, your voting form from the bank or brokerage firm will provide instructions. If your voting form does not reference Internet or telephone information, please complete and return the paper proxy card in the enclosed envelope.
How Proxies work
Giving us your proxy means you authorize us to vote your shares at the Meeting in the manner you direct. You may vote for or not vote for the nominees for director named in this Proxy Statement. You may also vote for or abstain from voting on the proposal to ratify and approve the appointment of KWCO, PC, as our independent auditors and authorizing the directors to fix their remuneration, or you may vote for or vote against the Stock Option Plan.
If you sign and return the enclosed proxy but do not specify how to vote, we will vote your shares in favor of the nominees for director named in this Proxy Statement and in favor of the other proposals described in this Proxy Statement. In the discretion of the proxy holders, the proxies will also be voted for or against such other matters as may properly come before the Meeting. At the date this Proxy Statement went to press we did not know of any other matters to be raised at the Meeting.
The persons named in the enclosed proxy are our directors and officers and you may strike out the names of the persons whom you do not wish to act on your behalf. A shareholder has the right to appoint any person to attend and act for him or her at the Meeting. A Shareholder desiring to appoint a person to represent him at the Meeting may do so either by inserting such person's name in the blank space provided and striking out the printed names in the Form of Proxy or by completing another proxy. In either case, the proxy must be delivered to the offices of our registrar and transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company Inc., Proxy Department, 8th Floor, 100 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2Y1, at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled commencement of the Meeting.
You may receive more than one proxy depending on how you hold your shares. Shares registered in your name are covered by one proxy. If you hold shares through someone else, such as a bank or broker (that is, in street name) please refer to your proxy card or the information forwarded by your bank, broker or other holder of record for voting instructions. If you want to vote in person at the Meeting, and you hold your shares in street name, you must obtain a proxy from your bank or broker and bring the proxy to the Meeting.
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying Form of Proxy are first being mailed to shareholders on or about March 26, 2019.
These securityholder materials are being sent to both registered and non-registered owners of the securities. If you are a non-registered owner, and we or our agent have sent these materials directly to you, your name and address and information about your holdings of securities, have been obtained in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements from the intermediary holding on your behalf.
By choosing to send these materials to you directly, we (and not the intermediary holding on your behalf) have assumed responsibility for (i) delivering these materials to you, and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting instructions as specified in the request for voting instructions.
Revoking a Proxy
You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by submitting a new proxy with a later date, by voting in person at the Meeting, or by notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing at #507, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 3N6.
In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a shareholder may revoke a proxy either by (a) signing a Form of Proxy bearing a later date and depositing it at the place and within the time aforesaid, or (b) signing and dating a written notice of revocation (in the same manner as the Form of Proxy is required to be executed as set out in the notes to the form of proxy) and either depositing it at the place and within the time aforesaid or with the Chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or on the day of any adjournment thereof, or (c) registering with the Scrutineer at the Meeting as a shareholder present in person, whereupon such proxy shall be deemed to have been revoked.
Only registered shareholders have the right to revoke a proxy. Non-Registered Holders who wish to change their vote must, at least seven days before the Meeting, arrange for their respective Intermediaries to revoke the proxy on their behalf.
Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the Meeting, you must bring to the Meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your beneficial ownership of the shares and that such broker, bank or other nominee is not voting your shares.
The Form of Proxy must be dated and be signed by the shareholder or by his attorney in writing, or, if the shareholder is a corporation, it must either be under its common seal or signed by a duly authorized officer.
Quorum
To conduct the business of the meeting, we must have a quorum. This means at least 25% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must be represented at the Meeting, either by proxy or in person.
Votes needed
The five nominees for director receiving a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Meeting shall be elected. Approval to ratify and approve the appointment of KWCO, PC as auditor and authorizing the directors to fix their remuneration, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Meeting. If the Meeting is adjourned, your shares may be voted by the proxy holder on the new meeting date unless you have revoked your proxy.
Only votes cast "for" or "against" a proposal are counted. Abstentions and broker non-votes (or votes withheld in the election of directors) will not be counted, except for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes occur when a broker returns a proxy but does not have authority to vote on a particular proposal.
Attending in person
Only shareholders, their proxy holders, and Oculus' guests may attend the Meeting.
If you hold your shares through someone else, such as a bank or a broker, send proof of your ownership to the Secretary at the address listed above, or you may bring proof of ownership with you in order to be admitted to the Meeting. Acceptable proof could include an account statement showing that you owned Oculus shares on March 19, 2019.
We will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by directors, officers or employees in person or by telephone, email or fax. We will also reimburse banks, brokers and other persons holding shares in their names or in the names of their nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of such shares.
Non-Registered Shareholders
Only registered shareholders or duly appointed proxyholders are permitted to vote at the Meeting. Most shareholders of our company are "non-registered" shareholders because the shares they own are not registered in their names but are instead registered in the name of the brokerage firm, bank or trust company through which they purchased the shares. More particularly, a person is a non-registered shareholder in respect of shares which are held on behalf of that person (the "Non-Registered Holder") but which are registered either (a) in the name of an intermediary (the "Intermediary") that the Non-Registered Holder deals with in respect of the shares (Intermediaries include, among others, banks, trust companies, securities dealers or brokers and trustees or administrators of self-administered RRSP's, RRIF's, RESP's and similar plans); or (b) in the name of a clearing agency (such as The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited ("CDS")) of which the Intermediary is a participant. In accordance with the requirements of National Instrument 54-101 – Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer of the Canadian Securities Administrators, we have distributed copies of the Notice of Meeting, Proxy Statement and Form of Proxy (collectively referred to as the "Meeting Material") to the clearing agencies and Intermediaries for onward distribution to Non-Registered Holders.
Intermediaries are required to forward the Meeting Material to Non-Registered Holders unless a Non-Registered Holder has waived the right to receive them. Very often, Intermediaries will use service companies to forward the Meeting Material to Non-Registered Holders. Generally, Non-Registered Holders who have not waived the right to receive the Meeting Material will either:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (a)   be given a Form of Proxy which has already been signed by the Intermediary (typically by a facsimile, stamped signature) which is restricted to the number of shares beneficially owned by the Non-Registered Holder, but which is otherwise not complete. Because the Intermediary has already signed the Form of Proxy, this Form of Proxy is not required to be signed by the Non-Registered Holder when submitting the proxy. In this case, the Non-Registered Holder who wishes to submit a proxy should otherwise properly complete the Form of Proxy and deposit it with our registrar and transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company Inc., as provided above; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (b)   more typically, be given a voting instruction form which is not signed by the Intermediary, and which, when properly completed and signed by the Non-Registered Holder and returned to the Intermediary or its service company, will constitute voting instructions (often called a "proxy" or "authorization form") which the Intermediary must follow. Typically, the proxy authorization form will consist of a one page pre-printed form. Sometimes, instead of the one page printed form, the proxy authorization form will consist of a regular printed proxy form accompanied by a page of instructions that contains a removable label containing a bar-code and other information. In order for the form of proxy to validly constitute a proxy authorization form, the Non-Registered Holder must remove the label from the instructions and affix it to the form of proxy, properly complete and sign the form of proxy and return it to the Intermediary or its service company in accordance with the instructions of the Intermediary or its service company.  
[END TABLE]
In either case, the purpose of this procedure is to permit Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting of the shares that they beneficially own. Should a Non-Registered Holder who receives one of the above forms wish to vote at the Meeting in person, the Non-Registered Holder should strike out the names of the management designated proxy holders named in the form and insert the Non-Registered Holder's name in the blank space provided (executed by the broker). In either case, Non-Registered Holders should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediary, including when and where the proxy or proxy authorization form is to be delivered.
A revocation of a Proxy does not affect any matter on which a vote has been taken prior to the revocation.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K Annual Reports for the years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 will be presented to the shareholders at the Meeting.
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS OR COMPANIES IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
Except as disclosed elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, no director or executive officer who was a director or executive officer since the beginning of our last financial year, each proposed nominee for election as a director, or any associate or affiliates of any such directors, executive officers or nominees, has any material interest, direct or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter to be acted upon at the Meeting other than the election of directors.
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF VOTING SECURITIES
We are authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock. As of the Record Date, determined by the Board to be the close of business on March 19, 2019, a total of 45,572,568 common shares were issued and outstanding. Each share carries the right to one vote at the Meeting.
Only registered shareholders as of the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.
To the knowledge of our directors and executive officers, no person or company beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over, common shares carrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to our outstanding common shares.
ITEM 1: NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors has nominated and recommends FOR election of the five current directors for election at the Meeting. We are proposing that the number of directors be determined at five for the ensuing year, subject to such increases as may be permitted by our Bylaws. We currently have five directors.
The enclosed proxy will be voted FOR setting the number of directors at five unless otherwise indicated.
ITEM 2: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The enclosed proxy will be voted FOR the persons nominated unless otherwise indicated.
If any of the nominees should be unable to serve or should decline to do so, the discretionary authority provided in the proxy will be exercised by the proxy holders to vote for a substitute or substitutes to be designated by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any substitute nominee or nominees will be required.
Each nominee elected as a director will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or retirement. Set forth below for each nominee is his age and his position, if any, in our company.
The information set forth below as to each nominee for director has been furnished to us by the respective nominee.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consists of Maurice Loverso, Anton J. Drescher and Ron Wages, who serves as Chairman. The Board of Directors had determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and accounting matters to serve on the Committee and that Anton J. Drescher is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules.
The Audit Committee meets with our independent auditors at least quarterly to discuss the results of the annual audit or interim periodic reviews and to review the financial statements; appoints the independent auditors to be retained; oversees the independence of the independent accountants; evaluates the independent auditors' performance; approves fees paid to independent auditors and receives and considers the independent auditors' comments as to controls, adequacy of staff and management performance and procedures in connection with audit and financial controls. The Audit Committee met informally by telephone conference four times and signed four consent resolutions during each of fiscal 2012 and 2013.
The Audit Committee is primarily concerned with the effectiveness of our audits by our internal audit staff and by our independent auditors. Its duties include: (1) recommending the selection of independent auditors; (2) reviewing the scope of the audit to be conducted by them, as well as the results of their audit; (3) reviewing the organization and scope of our internal system of audit and financial controls; (4) appraising our financial reporting activities (including our Proxy Statement and Annual Report) and the accounting standards and principles followed; and (5) examining other reviews relating to compliance by employees with important policies and applicable laws. The Audit Committee operates under a written Charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Schedule "A".
Other Committees
The Board of Directors currently has no other committees.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Corporate Disclosure Policy that applies to our directors, officers and employees and Corporate Governance Guidelines that applies to our directors and officers. A copy of the Code of Ethics, Corporate Disclosure Policy and Corporate Governance Guidelines are posted on our website at http://www.ovtz.com. These documents are also available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at #507, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 3N6.
Relationship with Our Independent Auditors
The firm of KWCO, PC was appointed as our independent auditor on February 15, 2011. The Board of Directors recommended KWCO, PC to serve as our independent auditors for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The material in this report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), whether made before or after the date of this proxy statement and irrespective of any general incorporation language therein. 
The Audit Committee of the Board assists the Board in carrying out its oversight responsibilities for our financial reporting process, audit process and internal controls.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements with management, which has primary responsibility for the financial statements. KWCO, our current independent auditors for our 2011, 2012 and 2013 audit, was responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of our audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed in detail each of the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 with our management and with KWCO PC, our independent auditors. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with KWCO, PC the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards Number 61, Communication with Audit Committees, as modified or supplemented. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from KWCO PC required by Independence Standards Board Standard Number 1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees, as modified or supplemented, and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence from our company and our management. The Audit Committee has also considered whether KWCO PC's provision of non-audit services to us is compatible with the independence of such firm.
Members of the Audit Committee rely on the information provided to them and on the representations made to the Committee by management and our independent accountants without conducting independent verification of the accuracy of such information and representations. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not ensure that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not ensure that any audit of our financial statements conducted by our internal and independent accountants has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-Ks for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, for filing with the Commission.
Based on the Audit Committee's and management's assessment of the performance of KWCO PC during the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that KWCO PC be engaged as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2019.

DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND
OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview of Compensation Program 
We do not have a compensation committee. Our Board of Directors (the "Board") is responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence with our compensation policy. The Board ensures that the total compensation paid to our directors, officers and employees is fair, reasonable and competitive.
During the financial years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we had two Named Executive Officers ("NEO") being Rowland Perkins, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and President and Anton J. Drescher, our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and Corporate Secretary.
"Named Executive Officer" or "NEO" means: (a) each CEO, (b) each CFO, (c) each of the three most highly compensated executive officers, or the three most highly compensated individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the CEO and CFO, at the end of the most recently completed financial year whose total compensation was, individually, more than $150,000; and (d) each individual who would be a NEO under (c) above but for the fact that the individual was neither an executive officer of the company, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of that financial year.
Employments Contracts 
We do not have an employment contract with Mr. Perkins and Mr. Drescher. We have no obligation to provide any compensation to Mr. Perkins or Mr. Drescher in the event of their resignation, retirement or termination, or a change in control of our company, or a change in any NEO's responsibilities following a change in control.
We may in the future create retirement, pension, profit sharing and medical reimbursement plans covering our NEOs and directors.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Decisions concerning the compensation of our NEOs are made by the Board. All members of the Board during fiscal 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 participated in the Board's deliberations concerning NEO compensation during each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
Board of Directors Report on Executive Compensation
The Board determines the compensation of our NEOs.
We intend to establish a compensation committee at such time as we are able to attract a sufficient number of outside directors to the Board. We are unable to state when we will be able to establish a formal compensation committee. Pending establishment of the committee, the entire Board will continue to be responsible for our executive compensation policy.
Compensation Philosophy
We must compete for, attract, develop, motivate and retain high quality executive management personnel. In order to do so, we intend to offer a package including a competitive salary and, on a discretionary basis, additional compensation in the form of stock options.
Cash Compensation
Our executive salary levels are intended to be consistent with competitive salary levels and job responsibilities and experience level of each executive, as well as our overall salary structure and financial condition. Salary changes reflect competitive and economic trends, our overall financial performance and the performance of the individual executive. Salaries are reviewed annually by the Board.
Stock Options
Stock options are designed to attract and retain executives who can make significant contributions to our success, reward executives for such contributions, give executives a long-term incentive to increase shareholder value, and align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders.
The Board has made, and expects to continue to make, grants of stock options to executive officers. Recipients of option grants, and the size of the grants, are determined based on several factors, including the responsibilities of the individual officers, their past and anticipated contributions to our success, our overall performance, and prior option grants.
Compensation of the CEO
In setting the compensation payable for fiscal 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 to our NEOs, the Board generally considered the same factors described above, as well as our current financial condition. Given that we currently do not have any financial resources a decision was made to defer compensation to the NEOs until such time as we have sufficient funding. The Board intends that compensation to the NEOs will be competitive with compensation paid to executive officers of similar sized companies in our industry and to reward our NEOs for directing our efforts in initiating and expanding our streaming media business.
Benefits and Perquisites
Our NEOs do not receive any benefits or perquisites other than as disclosed herein.
IRS Limits on Deductibility of Compensation
We are subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limits the deductibility of certain compensation payments to our executive officers in excess of $1.0 million. No cash compensation was paid in fiscal 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018 the CEO or any other executive officer. Section 162(m) also provides for certain exemptions to the limitations on deductibility, including compensation that is "performance-based" within the meaning of Section 162(m). Because we do not currently have a compensation committee comprised solely of outside directors, we currently cannot avail ourselves of the "performance-based" compensation exemption under Section 162(m).
The Board during fiscal 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 consisted of:
Anton J. Drescher
Maurice Loverso
Rowland Perkins
Tom Perovic 
Ron Wages 
The following table sets forth compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our NEOs.

Audit Committee Charter
The text of our Audit Committee Charter is attached as Schedule "A" to this Circular.
Composition of the Audit Committee and Independence
National Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees, ("NI 52-110") provides that a member of an audit committee is "independent" if the member has no direct or indirect material relationship with a company, which could, in the view of the company's Board, reasonably interfere with the exercise of the member's independent judgment.
All of the members of our audit committee are independent, as that term is defined in NI 52-110, except for Anton J. Drescher, who is the Corporate Secretary and Chief Financial Officer. 
Relevant Education and Experience 
NI 52-110 provides that an individual is "financially literate" if he has the ability to read and understand a set of financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by a company's financial statements. While Maurice Loverso does not meet the criteria of "financially literate", both Ron Wages and Anton J. Drescher are considered financially literate. Collectively, they have many years of practical business experience, have served as a director of public companies and have experience reviewing financial statements of public companies.

Audit Committee Oversight
Since the commencement of our most recently completed fiscal year, our Audit Committee has not made any recommendations to nominate or compensate an external auditor which were not adopted by our Board.
Reliance on Certain Exemptions
Since the commencement of our most recently completed financial year and the effective date of NI 52-110, we have not relied on the exemptions contained in sections 2.4 or 8 of NI 52-110. Section 2.4 provides an exemption from the requirement that the audit committee must pre-approve all non-audit services to be provided by the auditors, where the total amount of fees related to the non-audit services are not expected to exceed 5% of the total amount of fees payable to the auditor in the fiscal year in which the non-audit services were provided. Section 8 permits a company to apply to a securities regulatory authority for an exemption from the requirements of NI 52-110, in whole or in part.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Our audit committee has adopted specific policies and procedures for the engagement of non-audit services which is set out in the Audit Committee Charter attached to this Circular as Schedule "A" in the section entitled "Independent Auditor".
Exemption
We are relying on the exemption provided by Part 6.1 of NI 52-110 for Venture Issuers which allows for an exemption from Part 3 (Composition of the Audit Committee) and Part 5 (Reporting Obligations) of NI 52-110 and allows for the short form of disclosure of audit committee procedures set out in Form 52-110F2 and disclosed in this Circular.
ITEM 4:   APPROVAL OF SHARE CONSOLIDATION 
At the Meeting there will be a proposal presented to Shareholders to authorize the Company's board of directors, subject to their approval and that of the TSX-V, to consolidate its then existing share capital, comprised of Common Shares, on an up to 15 old for one new (15:1) basis (the "Consolidation"). All terms provided herein are on a pre-Consolidation basis.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the adoption of the Consolidation.
ITEM 5:   APPROVAL OF 2019 STOCK OPTION PLAN
Introduction
At the Meeting there will be a proposal presented to Shareholders, to approve 2019 Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan") which was adopted by the board on March 14, 2019. The Option Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 4,557,257 (10% of current issued and outstanding) of our common shares, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, pursuant to exercise of options to be granted under the Option Plan. The stock subject to options under the Option Plan will be authorized but unissued common shares, including shares issuable under options that terminate without being exercised in whole or in part. The Option Plan provides for the issuance of both incentive stock options and non-qualified options as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Under the Code, for stock options to qualify as incentive stock options, the plan under which the options are issued must be approved by our shareholders within twelve months of the adoption of the Option Plan by the Board of Directors. If the Option Plan is not approved by the shareholders, the Option Plan will continue to be in effect; however, only non-qualified options may be issued under it.
The Option Plan is intended to promote the interests of our company and our shareholders by providing incentives to employees, directors and consultants, on whose judgment, initiative, and efforts the successful conduct of our business depends. These persons are responsible for the management, growth, and protection of our business, and the Option Plan provides these individuals with appropriate incentives and rewards to encourage them to maximize their performance and efforts for our company.
Adoption of the Option Plan is also subject to approval by the TSX.V. We will be submitting the Option Plan to the TSX.V and anticipate it will be approved. If the TSX.V should require any amendment to the Option Plan, the Board of Directors will make such amendment without shareholder approval to the extent it may do so under the Option Plan. If shareholder approval is required for any such amendment, the Board of Directors will either submit the Option Plan, as amended, for a vote of the shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable, or will discontinue the Option Plan.
On March 19, 2019, the closing bid price for the common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board was $0.0714 per share.
A copy of the full text of the Option Plan may be requested by submitting a request to Oculus VisionTech Inc., #507, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, V6C 3N6, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The principal features of the Option Plan are summarized below, but the summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Option Plan.
Administration
The Option Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may appoint a committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") comprised of two or more directors, each of whom will be a "Non-Employee Director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and an "Outside Director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, to administer the Option Plan. Subject to the terms of the Option Plan, the Board of Directors or the Committee may determine and designate those employees, directors and consultants to whom options should be granted and the nature and terms of the options to be granted.
Eligibility
All employees, including its executive officers and directors who are also employees, are eligible to participate in the Option Plan. Additionally, directors who are not employees, as well as consultants and advisers, are eligible to receive options under the Option Plan, except that such persons may only receive non-qualified options.
Exercise of Stock Options
The exercise price per share for each option granted under the Option Plan shall be determined by the Board of Directors or the Committee. However, the exercise price per share of each incentive stock option granted under the Option Plan shall not be less than the fair market value of the common shares on the date of the grant for incentive stock options; and 10% of the fair market value of the common shares for each incentive stock option granted to an individual owning more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock ("10% Shareholders"). In addition, because our shares are traded on the TSX.V, the exercise price of options granted under the Option Plan may not be less than the minimum price permitted under TSX.V policies, which is generally the market price at the close of trading on the day immediately preceding the day the options are granted, subject to certain allowable discounts. The price is payable in cash.
Subject to earlier termination upon termination of employment and the incentive stock option limitations as provided in the Option Plan, each option shall expire on the date specified by the Board of Directors or the Committee, which shall be no later than five years from the date of grant for grants to 10% Shareholders and ten years for all other options.
The options will either be fully exercisable on the date of grant or shall be exercisable thereafter in such installments as the Board of Directors or Committee may specify. Upon termination of employment or other service of an option holder, an option may only be exercised for a period of three months or, in the case of termination due to disability or death, a period of 12 months.
Change in Control
If we were to be consolidated with or acquired by another entity in a merger, or there is to be a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or stock, the Board of Directors may either by agreement or by action taken before the triggering transaction (i) provide in any agreement with the surviving, new or acquiring company to grant options to the optionees to replace options granted under the Option Plan, (ii) make unvested options immediately exercisable, or (iii) take such other action as it determines may be reasonable under the circumstances in order to permit optionees to realize the value of the rights granted to them under the Option Plan.
Transferability
Options granted under the Option Plan may not be transferred except by will or the laws of the descent and distribution and, during his or her lifetime, options may be exercised only by the optionee.
Certain Adjustments
In the event of any change in the number or kind of our outstanding common shares by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, subdivision, rights issuance or other similar corporate change, the Board of the Committee shall make such adjustment in the number of common shares that may be issued under the Option Plan, and the number of common shares subject to, and the exercise price of, each then-outstanding option, as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
Amendment or Discontinuance
The Board may amend or discontinue the Option Plan, provided that no amendment may, without an optionee's consent, materially and adversely effect any rights under any option previously granted to the optionee under the Option Plan. Additionally, the approval of our shareholders is required for any amendment that would:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● increase or decrease the number of common shares that may be issued under the Option Plan; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Option Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Tax Treatment of Options
Incentive stock options granted under the Option Plan are intended to be qualified incentive stock options under the provisions of Section 422 of the Code. All other options granted under the Option Plan are non-qualified options not entitled to special tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code. Generally, the grant of an incentive stock option will not result in taxable income for income tax purposes to the optionee at the time of the grant, and we will not be entitled to an income tax deduction at such time. Generally, the grant of non-qualified options will not result in taxable income to the optionee at the time of the grant and we will not be entitled to an income tax deduction at such time.
When incentive stock options granted under the Option Plan are exercised, the optionee will not be treated as receiving any taxable income, and we will not be entitled to an income tax deduction. However, the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the option exercise price is an item of adjustment in computing the alternative minimum tax of the optionee. Upon the exercise of a non-qualified option, an optionee will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock at the time of exercise over the exercise price. Thus, the optionee will have to pay taxes at the time a non-qualified option is exercised even though the shares received upon exercise might not be sold until a later taxable year. For employees (including officers and directors who are considered employees for purposes of the withholding provisions of the Code), the income recognized on the exercise of a non-qualified option is subject to withholding of income tax under Section 3402(a) of the Code.
We will receive an income tax deduction for the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee at the time and in the amount that the optionee recognizes such income to the extent permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code and provided that (i) such income constitutes reasonable compensation and is otherwise deductible under the Code and (ii) our U.S. federal income tax withholding obligations with respect to such income are satisfied.
An optionee's tax basis in the shares received upon exercise of an incentive stock option will be equal to the exercise price paid by the optionee for such shares. An optionee's tax basis in the shares received upon the exercise of a non-qualified option will be equal to the sum of (i) the exercise price paid by the optionee for such shares and (ii) the amount that the optionee is required to include in gross income upon exercising the non-qualified option. Upon the later disposition of the shares received upon exercise of an option, any differences between the tax basis of the shares and the amount realized on the disposition is generally treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding period of the common shares. Nevertheless, if the shares subject to an incentive stock option are disposed of before the expiration of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, the optionee will realize ordinary income on an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares, upon exercise of the option over the option price (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized upon disposition over the option price) and we will receive a corresponding income tax deduction.
In order for an optionee to receive the favorable tax treatment for incentive stock options, certain requirements set forth in Section 422 of the Code must be met. For example, the optionee must be an officer or employee at all times within the period beginning on the date of grant of the option and ending on a date within three months before the date of exercise. In addition, the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of grant) of the shares for which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by the optionee in any calendar year under all relevant plans of our company (and certain affiliates) cannot exceed $100,000.
The description above is intended to summarize the general principles of current federal income tax law applicable to options that may be granted under the Option Plan. The tax consequences of awards made under the Option Plan are complex, subject to change, and may vary depending on the taxpayer's particular circumstances. Additionally, the grant and exercise of options under the Option Plan to persons outside the United States may be taxed on a different basis.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this Item at the Meeting is required for the adoption of the Option Plan.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the adoption of the Stock Option Plan.

SCHEDULE "B"
DISCLOSURE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE
National Instrument 58-101, Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices, requires all reporting issuers to provide certain annual disclosure of their corporate governance practices with respect to the corporate governance guidelines (the "Guidelines") adopted in National Policy 58-201. These Guidelines are not prescriptive, but have been used by us in adopting our corporate governance practices. Our approach to corporate governance is set out below.
Mandate and Responsibility of the Board 
Our Board is responsible for supervising management in carrying on the business and affairs of our company. Directors are required to act and exercise their powers with reasonable prudence in our best interests. The Board agrees with and confirms its responsibility for overseeing management's performance in the following particular areas: our strategic planning process; identification and management of the principal risks associated with our business; planning for succession of management; our policies regarding communications with our shareholders and others; and the integrity of our internal controls and management information systems.
In carrying out its mandate, the Board relies primarily on management to provide it with regular detailed reports on our operations and our financial position. The Board reviews and assesses these reports and other information provided to it at meetings of the full Board and of its committees. Our CEO is a member of the Board, giving the Board direct access to information on all areas of responsibility.
The independent directors do not hold separate meetings at which members of management are absent.
Composition of the Board
The Board facilitates its exercise of independent supervision over our management through frequent communication with the Board.
The Board is comprised of five directors, of whom Maurice Loverso, Tom Perovic and Ron Wages are independent. Rowland Perkins is not independent since he serves as President and CEO and Anton J. Drescher is not independent as he serves as Corporate Secretary and Chief Financial Officer.

During fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors held a number of informal meetings, and took action by unanimous written consent on four occasions. During fiscal 2017, the Board of Directors held a number of informal meetings, and took action by unanimous written consent on four occasions.
Orientation and Continuing Education
The Board does not have any formal policies with respect to the orientation of new directors nor does it take any measures to provide continuing education for the directors. At this stage of our development the Board does not feel it necessary to have such policies or programs in place. New directors are provided with access to our recent, publicly filed documents and our internal financial information, are provided with access to management and technical experts and consultants and a summary of significant corporate and securities responsibilities.
Members of the Board are encouraged to communicate with management, auditors and technical consultants, to keep themselves current with industry trends and developments and changes in legislation with management's assistance and to attend related industry seminars and visit our offices. Board members have full access to our records.
Ethical Business Conduct
Our Board currently has a written code of ethics and views good corporate governance as an integral component to our success. In addition, our Board monitors on an ongoing basis the activities of management to ensure that the highest standard of ethical conduct is maintained. The Board views good corporate governance as an integral component to its success and to meet its responsibilities to shareholders. As we do not have a large number of officers and consultants, the Board is able to monitor on an ongoing basis the activities of management and to ensure that the highest standard of ethical conduct is maintained.
Board Approvals and Review 
No formal description has yet been established of the types of decisions by us which will require prior Board approval. To date, all substantive decisions involving acquisitions, major financings, major asset sales, budgets and major business initiatives have been referred to the Board. As and when our activities evolve beyond the early stages of exploration and development for mineral interests, review and approval criteria will be further considered and specific dollar capital amounts established.
Nomination of Directors
The Board considers its size each year when it considers the number of directors to recommend to the shareholders for election at the annual meeting of shareholders, taking into account the number required to carry out the Board's duties effectively and to maintain a diversity of view and experience.
The Board does not have a nominating committee, and these functions are currently performed by the Board as a whole. However, if there is a change in the number of directors required by us, this policy will be reviewed.
Position Descriptions 
The Board has not developed written position descriptions for the Chairman, the Chairman of Board Committees, or the Chief Executive Officer. The Board is of the view that given our size, the relatively frequent discussions between Board members and the CEO, and the experience of the individual members of the Board, the responsibilities of such individuals are known and understood without position descriptions being reduced to writing. The Board will evaluate this position from time to time and if written position descriptions appear to be justified, they will be prepared.
Compensation 
Our independent directors, Maurice Loverso, Tom Perovic and Ron Wages, have the responsibility for determining compensation for the directors and senior management and the quantity and quality of the Board compensation is reviewed on an annual basis. To determine compensation payable, the independent directors review compensation paid to directors, CEOs and CFOs of companies of similar size and at a similar stage of development in our industry and determine an appropriate compensation reflecting the need to provide incentive and compensation for the time and effort expended by the directors and senior management while taking into account our financial and other resources. In setting the compensation, the independent directors annually review the performance of the CEO and CFO in light of our objectives and consider other factors that may have impacted our success in achieving our objectives.
At present, we are not paying any compensation to the directors and senior management. We may in the future grant incentive stock options. The number of options to be granted is determined by the Board as a whole, which allows the independent directors to have input into compensation decisions. At this time, we do not believe our size and limited scope of operations requires a formal compensation committee.
Description of Board Committees 
At the present time, our only standing committee is the Audit Committee. As our directors are actively involved in our operations, and the size of our operations does not warrant a larger Board, the Board has determined that additional committees are not necessary at this stage of our development.
The written charter of the Audit Committee, as required by NI 52-110, is contained in Schedule "A" to this Proxy Statement. As we grow, and our operations and management structure become more complex, the Board expects it will constitute formal standing committees, such as a Corporate Governance Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee, and will ensure that such committees are governed by written charters and are composed of at least a majority of independent directors.
Assessments 
Our Board does not consider that formal assessments would be useful at this stage of our development. The Board conducts informal annual assessments of the Board's effectiveness, the individual directors and of our Audit Committee. To assist in its review, the Board conducts informal surveys of its directors about assessment of the functioning of the Board. As part of the assessments, the Board or the individual committee may review its mandate and conduct reviews of applicable corporate policies.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 7.   Price  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (d)   if the exercise price is reduced to the Discounted Market Price, the TSXV four (4) month hold period will apply from the date of the amendment;  
[END TABLE]
provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection 7.2, in no event will the exercise price of an Option held by a U.S. Participant be reduced below the fair market value of a Share on the date of such repricing.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.   Option Period and Exercise of Options  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.1   The Option Period for an Option shall be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time the Option is granted and may be up to ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted. At the time an Option is granted, the Compensation Committee may determine that, with respect to that Option, upon the occurrence of one of the events described in subsection 10.1 there shall come into force a time limit for exercise of such Option which is different than the Option Period, and in the event of such a determination, the Option Agreement for such Option shall contain provisions which specify the events and time limits related to that determination, provided that Options granted to any Optionee who is a Director, Senior Officer, Employee, Consultant or Management Company Employee must expire within a reasonable period after the Optionee ceases to be in at least one of those categories. Subject to the applicable maximum Option Period provided for in this subsection 8.1 and subject to applicable regulatory requirements and approvals/acceptances, the Compensation Committee may extend the Option Period of an outstanding Option beyond its original expiration date, provided that disinterested shareholder approval is obtained for any extension of the Option Period of an outstanding Option held by an Insider.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.2   Subject to subparagraph 5.1(b)(v), the Compensation Committee may determine when any Option will become exercisable and may determine that the Option shall vest and/or be exercisable in instalments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.3   If there is a takeover bid or tender offer made for all or any of the issued and outstanding Shares, then the Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion and if permitted by applicable legislation and the TSXV, unilaterally determine that outstanding Options, whether fully vested and exercisable or subject to vesting provisions or other limitations on exercise, shall be conditionally exercisable in full to enable the Optioned Shares subject to such Options to be conditionally issued and tendered to such bid or offer, subject to the conditions that:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (a)   if the bid or offer is not duly completed the exercise of such Options and the issue of such Shares will be rescinded and nullified and the Options, including any vesting provisions or other limitations on exercise which were in effect will be re-instated; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (b)   any reduction in any vesting provisions beyond the minimum vesting provisions required by the TSXV will be subject to acceptance for filing thereof by the TSXV.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.4   The vested portions of Options will be exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time after vesting. If an Option is exercised for fewer than all of the Optioned Shares for which the Option has then vested, the Option shall remain in force and exercisable for the remaining Optioned Shares for which the Option has then vested, according to the terms of such Option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.5   The exercise of any Option will be contingent upon receipt by the Company of payment in full for the exercise price of the Shares being purchased in cash by way of certified cheque or bank draft or other method of payment acceptable to the Company. Neither an Optionee nor the legal representatives, legatees or distributees of such Optionee will be, or will be deemed to be, a holder of any Shares subject to an Option under the Plan unless and until certificates for such Shares are issuable to the Optionee or such other persons pursuant to the Option or the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.6   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection Error! Reference source not found. or the date of expiration of an Option determined in accordance with this Plan ("Fixed Term"), the date of expiration of an Option will be adjusted, without being subject to Board or Compensation Committee discretion, to take into account any blackout period imposed on the Optionee by the Company as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (a)   if the Fixed Term expiration date falls within a blackout period imposed on the Optionee by the Company, then the Fixed Term expiration date is extended to the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day after the end of such blackout period (the "Blackout Expiration Term"); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (b)   if the Fixed Term expiration date falls within two (2) business days after the end of a blackout period imposed on the Optionee by the Company, then the Fixed Term expiration date will be that date which is the Blackout Expiration Term reduced by the number of business days between the Fixed Term expiration date and the end of such blackout period (i.e. Options whose Fixed Term expires two (2) business days after the end of the blackout period will only have an additional eight (8) business days to exercise).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.7   Unless registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act") and any applicable state securities laws, the Options and the Optioned Shares underlying the Options granted pursuant to this Plan to an Optionee in the United States or an Optionee that is a U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) shall be "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) of the U.S. Securities Act and the Optioned Shares shall not be offered, sold or transferred absent registration under the U.S. Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or an available exemption from such registration requirements.

The Options may not be exercised in the United States or by or for the account or benefit of a U.S. Person or a person in the United States and the underlying Common Shares may not be delivered within the United States unless the underlying Common Shares to be delivered upon exercise of these Options have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of all applicable states of the United States or an exemption from such registration requirements is available. "United States" and "U.S. Person" are used herein as such terms are defined by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act."
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8.9   Absent registration under the U.S. Securities Act, all certificates representing the Optioned Shares issued to an Optionee in the United States or an Optionee that is a U.S. Person under this Plan shall bear a restrictive legend in substantially the following form:  
[END TABLE]
"THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND ARE RESTRICTED SECURITIES AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

 10.   Effect of Termination of Employment or Death  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 10.1   An outstanding Option shall remain in full force and effect and exercisable according to its terms for the Option Period notwithstanding that the holder of such Option ceases to be a Director, Employee, Officer or Consultant of the Company for any reason, including death, subject always to any express term in any Option Agreement made pursuant to subsection 8.1 which provides that upon the occurrence of one of such events there shall come into force a time limit for exercise of such Option which is different than the Option Period. So long as the Shares are listed on the TSXV (unless otherwise permitted by the TSXV) the maximum period within which the heirs or administrators of a deceased Optionee may exercise any portion of an outstanding Option is one (1) year from the date of death or the balance of the Option Period, whichever is earlier.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 10.2   In the event of the death of an Optionee, an Option which remains exercisable may be exercised in accordance with its terms by the person or persons to whom such Optionee's rights under the Option shall have passed under the Optionee's will or pursuant to law.

 11.   Adjustment in Shares Subject to the Plan  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 11.1   Following the date an Option is granted, the exercise price for and the number of Optioned Shares which are subject to an Option will be adjusted, with respect to the then unexercised portion thereof, by the Compensation Committee from time to time (on the basis of such advice as the Compensation Committee considers appropriate, including, if considered appropriate by the Compensation Committee, a certificate of the auditor of the Company) in the events and in accordance with the provisions and rules set out in this section 11, with the intent that the rights of Optionees under their Options are, to the extent possible, preserved notwithstanding the occurrence of such events. The Compensation Committee will conclusively determine any dispute that arises at any time with respect to any adjustment pursuant to such provisions and rules, and any such determination will be binding on the Company, the Optionee and all other affected parties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 11.2   The number of Optioned Shares to be issued on the exercise of an Option shall be adjusted from time to time to account for each dividend of Shares (other than a dividend in lieu of cash dividends paid in the ordinary course), so that upon exercise of the Option for an Optioned Share the Optionee shall receive, in addition to such Optioned Share, an additional number of Shares ("Additional Shares"), at no further cost, to adjust for each such dividend of Shares. The adjustment shall take into account every dividend of Shares that occurs between the date of the grant of the Option and the date of exercise of the Option for such Optioned Share. If there has been more than one such dividend, the adjustment shall also take into account that the dividends that are later in time would have been distributed not only on the Optioned Share had it been outstanding, but also on all Additional Shares which would have been outstanding as a result of previous dividends.
