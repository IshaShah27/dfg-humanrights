GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING
In this section of the proxy statement, we answer some common questions regarding Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.'s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and the voting of shares at the annual meeting.
Where and when will the annual meeting be held?
The date, time and place of the annual meeting is:
January 24, 2019
9:30 a.m. (Pacific Time)
Hyatt Regency Valencia
24500 Town Center Drive
Valencia, CA Why did I receive a notice of Internet availability of proxy materials in the mail instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials?
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has approved rules (the "e-proxy rules") allowing companies to furnish proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"), to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing paper copies. We believe these e-proxy rules provide a convenient and quick way to access the proxy materials and vote shares, while allowing us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing the proxy materials. Accordingly, certain of our stockholders will receive a Notice and will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. The Notice will provide such stockholders with notice of the annual meeting and will also provide instructions regarding accessing and reviewing all of the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice also provides instructions as to how you may submit your proxy on the Internet or by telephone. If you received the Notice and you would instead prefer to receive a paper or email copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials that are provided in the Notice. Any request to receive proxy materials by mail or email will remain in effect until you revoke it.
Why did you send me the proxy materials or the Notice?
We sent you the proxy materials or the Notice because we are holding our annual meeting of stockholders and the Company's board of directors (the "Board") is asking for your proxy to vote your shares at the annual meeting. We have summarized information in this proxy statement that you should consider in deciding how to vote at the annual meeting.
Can I vote my shares by filling out and returning the Notice?
No. The Notice identifies the items to be voted on at the annual meeting, but you cannot vote by marking the Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to authorize your proxy by Internet or by telephone or by requesting and returning a paper proxy card, or you may vote your shares by submitting a ballot in person at the meeting.
Who can vote?
You can vote your shares of common stock if our records show that you were the owner of the shares as of the close of business on November 30, 2018, the record date for determining the stockholders who are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. As of November 30, 2018, there were a total of 99,626,255 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. You get one vote for each share of common stock that you own.
How is a quorum determined?
We will hold the annual meeting if stockholders representing the required quorum of shares of common stock entitled to vote either authorize their proxy online or telephonically, sign and return their proxy cards or attend the annual meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting constitutes a quorum. If you authorize your proxy online or telephonically or sign and return your proxy card, your shares will be counted to determine whether we have a quorum even if you abstain or fail to indicate your vote on the proxy card. Table of Contents
What is the required vote for approval?
The election of each of our nominees for director requires a plurality of the votes validly cast at the annual meeting. If you withhold votes for purposes of the vote on the election of directors, your withheld votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of such votes. Broker non-votes also have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
The approval by a non-binding advisory vote of our executive compensation, the approval of an amendment (the "Plan Amendment") to the Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. 2014 Incentive Award Plan (the "2014 Plan") and the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors require a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on such matters at the annual meeting. If you abstain for purposes of the approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation, the approval of the Plan Amendment or the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against these proposals. For the approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation and the approval of the Plan Amendment, broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. However, New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules permit brokers to vote uninstructed shares at their discretion regarding the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors, so broker non-votes are not expected on that proposal.
How do I vote by proxy?
Follow the instructions on the Notice or the proxy card to authorize a proxy to vote your shares electronically via the Internet or by telephone or by completing and returning the proxy card if you received paper proxy materials to vote on the matters to be considered at the annual meeting. The individuals named and designated as proxies will vote your shares as you instruct. You have the following choices in completing your voting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote on each proposal, in which case your shares will be voted in accordance with your choices. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In voting on directors, you can either vote "FOR" all directors or withhold your vote on all or certain directors specified by you. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may abstain from voting on the proposal to approve the advisory vote on our executive compensation, to approve the Plan Amendment or to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors, in which case no vote will be recorded with respect to the matter on which you abstained from voting. 
[END TABLE]
You may return a signed proxy card without indicating your vote on any matter, in which case the designated proxies will vote to elect all three director nominees, approve on an advisory basis our executive compensation, approve the Plan Amendment and ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors.
How can I authorize my proxy online or via telephone?
In order to authorize your proxy online or via telephone, go to www.proxyvote.com or call the toll-free number reflected on the Notice, and follow the instructions. Please have your Notice in hand when accessing the site, as it contains a 16-digit control number required for access. You can authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, January 23, 2019, the day before the annual meeting.
If you received paper proxy materials, you may also refer to the enclosed proxy card for instructions. If you choose not to authorize your proxy electronically, please complete and return the paper proxy card in the pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided.
What if other matters come up at the annual meeting?
The only matters we now know of that will be voted on at the annual meeting are the proposals we have described in this proxy statement: the election of three Class II directors, the approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation, the approval of the Plan Amendment and the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.  If other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting, the designated proxies will vote your shares at their discretion. Table of Contents
Can I change my previously authorized vote?
Yes, at any time before the vote on a proposal. You can change your vote either by executing or authorizing, dating and delivering to us a new proxy via the Internet, telephone or mail at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, January 23, 2019, the day before the annual meeting, by giving us a written notice revoking your proxy card or by attending the annual meeting and voting your shares in person. Your attendance at the annual meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy previously given by you. We will honor the latest dated proxy.
Proxy revocation notices or new proxy cards should be sent to Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc., 24911 Avenue Stanford, Valencia, California 91355, Attention: John Holland.
Can I vote in person at the annual meeting rather than by authorizing a proxy?
Although we encourage you to authorize your proxy to ensure that your vote is counted, you can attend the annual meeting and vote your shares in person even if you authorized your proxy electronically or telephonically or submitted a proxy card.
Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy?
Depending on the proposal, your shares may be voted if they are held in the name of a brokerage firm, even if you do not provide the brokerage firm with voting instructions. Brokerage firms have the authority under the NYSE rules to cast votes on certain "routine" matters if they do not receive instructions from their customers. The proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors is considered a "routine" matter for which brokerage firms may vote shares without receiving voting instructions. Brokerage firms do not have the authority under the NYSE rules to vote on non-routine matters. The election of directors, the approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation and the approval of the Plan Amendment are considered non-routine matters. If you do not provide the brokerage firm with voting instructions on these proposals, your shares will not be voted and are called "broker non-votes." However, broker non-votes will still be considered present for the purpose of determining whether we have a quorum.
What do I do if my shares are held in "street name"?
If your shares are held in the name of your broker, a bank or other nominee in "street name," that party will give you instructions for voting your shares. If your shares are held in "street name" and you would like to vote your shares in person at the annual meeting, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to obtain a proxy form from the record holder of your shares.
Who will count the votes?
Representatives of Broadridge Financial Services, Inc. will count the votes and will serve as the independent inspector of election.
Who pays for this proxy solicitation?
We do. In addition to sending you these materials, some of our employees or agents may contact you by telephone, by mail or in person. None of our employees will receive any extra compensation for doing this.
        If you have additional questions about this proxy statement or the annual meeting or would like additional copies, without charge, of this document or our annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, please contact: Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc., 24911 Avenue Stanford, Valencia, California 91355, Attn: John Holland.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to hold regularly scheduled executive sessions for the non-management directors without any management directors or employees present, at least one of which annually includes only independent directors. Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors are required to appoint an independent, non-management member of the Board to preside over the non-management executive sessions, including executive sessions at which only independent directors are present. However, if the Board elects an independent, non-management director as the chairman of the Board, such chairman will serve as the presiding director. Adam Palmer currently serves as the presiding director.
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting of Stockholders
Although the Company does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at our annual meeting of stockholders, we encourage directors to attend. Eight Board members attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Table of Contents

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides an overview and analysis of (i) the elements of our compensation program for our named executive officers ("NEOs") identified below, (ii) the material compensation decisions made for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and reflected in the executive compensation tables that follow this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and (iii) the material factors considered in making those decisions.
Our Named Executive Officers
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 our NEOs are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Todd Renehan, Chief Executive Officer, 
  Kerry Shiba, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
  Alex Murray, President and Chief Operating Officer, 
  Declan Grant, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and 
  Dan Snow, former Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer. 
[END TABLE]
The above reflects our NEOs' principal positions as of September 30, 2018 and includes all individuals who were serving as our executive officers on such date. On October 6, 2017, Mr. Snow retired as Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer of the Company.
Executive Summary
Our Business
Founded in 1953 by the father of our current Board Chairman, we have grown to serve over 7,000 customers, which are primarily in the commercial, military and general aviation sectors, including the leading original equipment manufacturers and their subcontractors, through which we support nearly all major Western aircraft programs, and also sell products to airline-affiliated and independent maintenance, repair and overhaul providers. We also service customers in the automotive, energy, health care, industrial, pharmaceutical and space sectors. We have 3,069 employees and operate across 56 locations in 17 countries.
Wesco 2020 Initiative
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a comprehensive business assessment to determine the steps necessary to improve our operational and financial performance. The assessment process confirmed that opportunities exist for a significant uplift in profitability through footprint alignment, organizational refinement and broader productivity gains, as well as a need to invest in upgrading critical capabilities to serve customers and manage inventory better. The assessment led to the development of "Wesco 2020," with the following key initiatives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align our footprint with our customer and supplier base to enhance service, improve operating efficiency and reduce costs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Refine our organizational structure to drive greater accountability, enhance capabilities, reduce management layers, eliminate duplication and lower costs 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Invest strategically in people and capabilities, including automation and business tools to drive more effective inventory management and greater efficiency. 
[END TABLE]
In connection with Wesco 2020, we also implemented an executive retention and performance award program designed to retain key executives and align incentive compensation with our Wesco 2020 strategic initiatives.  This program consisted of  Table of Contents supplemental restricted share units ("RSU") and performance share units ("PSU") that were awarded to our NEOs, which are discussed below under the heading "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards—Wesco 2020 Awards."  
2018 Compensation Highlights
Our executive compensation program has been designed to motivate, reward, attract and retain high caliber management deemed essential to ensure our success.  As we have had substantial turnover in our executive team in recent years, we focused on designing compensation programs in fiscal 2018 that would drive retention among our newly established management team and promote stockholder value by providing meaningful and realistic performance incentives aligned to our key strategic initiatives going forward. Key compensation highlights for fiscal 2018 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target compensation levels. We maintained total target pay levels that our Compensation Committee believes are in-line with market comparables and reasonably consistent with our historical pay levels for these positions. 
• Annual Cash Awards. Target annual cash incentive awards continued to be determined primarily (80%) based on pre-set Bonus EBITDA and Bonus Cash Flow metrics that were designed to be challenging and set in connection with our annual budgeting process. For fiscal 2018, we outperformed against our Bonus EBITDA target but underperformed on Bonus Cash Flow target, resulting in payouts slightly below target for each of our NEOs. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Incentive Plan Design.  To improve retentive aspects of our long-term incentive awards, we reduced the weighting of stock option grants in our long-term incentive program for fiscal 2018.  Long-term incentive grants for fiscal 2018 consisted of 25% stock options, 25% PSUs and 50% RSUs.  As in prior years, regular annual PSU awards are earned based on achievement of relative total shareholder return ("TSR") and return on invested capital metrics ("ROIC").   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Wesco 2020 Awards. In connection with Wesco 2020, we implemented a special retention and performance award program designed to retain key executives and align incentive compensation with our Wesco 2020 strategic initiatives.  PSU awards were granted as part of this program and provide for no awards to be earned unless at least $15 million in annualized savings are realized before September 30, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Key Compensation Philosophies and Practices
Below, we highlight certain executive compensation practices we employ to align executive compensation with stockholder interests. Also listed below are certain compensation practices we do not employ because we believe they would not serve our long-term value creation goals. Table of Contents
What We Do
[BEGIN TABLE]
ü   Pay for performance.    We tie annual and long-term pay to objective performance metrics, including key goals, such as cash flow, EBITDA and ROIC. Approximately 75% of our Chief Executive Officer's regular annual pay is intended to be variable and tied to performance, with approximately 25% guaranteed in the form of salary or limited employee benefits. 
ü   Adhere to rigorous goals and reward meaningful executive contributions.    We use objective performance-based goals in our annual and long-term incentive plans that we believe are rigorous and designed to motivate executive performance. 
ü   Link compensation to total stockholder return and strategic initiatives.    Executive compensation is linked to stockholder returns through annual equity grants consisting of PSUs, RSUs and stock options. For fiscal 2018, a portion of all NEOs' equity incentive awards were issued under a performance-based stock award program, under which awards vest after three years based on attainment of TSR and ROIC metrics.  Our Wesco 2020 PSUs are directly aligned with our Wesco 2020 strategic initiatives. 
ü   Encourage meaningful stock ownership by our NEOs.    We have adopted a stock ownership policy under which our Chief Executive Officer and all other executive officers must hold shares of our common stock having a specified multiple of their annual base salary. 
ü   Retain and hire top caliber executives.    Our objective is to provide compensation and benefits that are in alignment with the market for the talent we seek. 
ü   Maintain flexibility in compensation programs.    Guaranteed or multi-year equity grants or bonuses are not provided to any of our NEOs. This gives us flexibility to adjust our compensation program as necessary to ensure we offer the optimum mix of annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives to attract and retain key talent. 
[END TABLE]
What We Don't Do
[BEGIN TABLE]
x   No multi-year or guaranteed bonuses or equity grants.    We do not pay guaranteed bonuses to anyone and currently have no guaranteed commitments to grant any equity-based awards. This ensures that we are able to base all compensation awards on measurable performance factors and business results. 
x   No generous executive perquisites.    We do not provide costly perquisites to our NEOs, such as a Company aircraft and similar items. 
x   No income tax gross-ups.   With the exception of relocation expenses, we do not provide income tax gross-ups for personal benefits and other broad-based benefits. 
x   No excise tax gross-ups.    We do not provide excise tax gross-ups for change in control benefits. 
x   No costly employment agreements with executives.  We have not entered into employment agreements with our current executives and our standard executive severance agreement provides modest severance and termination entitlements. 
x   No pension or supplemental retirement plans.    We do not provide costly retirement benefits to our NEOs that reward longevity rather than contributions to Company performance. 
x   No repricing of options.    Our stockholder approved equity incentive plan does not permit us to reprice options without stockholder approval. 
x   No hedging.    Our corporate policies prohibit executive officers from hedging the economic risk of ownership of our common stock. 
[END TABLE]
Elements and Objectives of Executive Compensation
The primary elements of our executive compensation program and their corresponding objectives are summarized in the following table:  Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Element   Description and Objectives 
Base Salary   Recognizes performance of job responsibilities and is a necessary tool to attract and retain executives.   
Base Salary   Recognizes performance of job responsibilities and is a necessary tool to attract and retain executives.   
Annual performance-based compensation   Promotes near-term performance objectives and rewards individual contributions.    
Long-term equity incentive awards   Emphasizes our long-term performance objectives, retention and value creation.  Annual equity award grants are made in the form of stock options, PSUs and RSUs.  Awards for fiscal 2018 also included special retention awards and PSUs aligned with our Wesco 2020 strategic initiatives.    
Severance and change in control benefits   Encourages the continued attention and dedication of key individuals and allows them to focus on the value to stockholders when considering strategic alternatives.  Unless a change in control occurs severance for all executives is generally limited to one year of compensation or less.  
Severance and change in control benefits   Encourages the continued attention and dedication of key individuals and allows them to focus on the value to stockholders when considering strategic alternatives.  Unless a change in control occurs severance for all executives is generally limited to one year of compensation or less.  
Retirement savings (401(k))   Provides an opportunity for tax-efficient savings and long-term financial security.  No executive retirement plan is offered.  
Other elements of compensation and perquisites   Limited benefits and perquisites attract and retain talented executives in a cost-efficient manner by providing benefits with high perceived values at relatively low cost to us.  
[END TABLE]
Decision Processes
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer for NEOs other than our Chief Executive Officer, has authority to determine and approve compensation decisions with respect to our NEOs. In alignment with the objectives set forth above, the Compensation Committee has historically determined overall compensation, and its allocation among the elements described above, in reliance upon the judgment and general industry knowledge of its members obtained through years of service with comparably-sized companies in our industry and similar industries. Since fiscal 2014, the Compensation Committee has used the services of an independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, to provide assistance in developing executive compensation programs. See below under the heading "—Compensation Overview—Role of Compensation Consultant."
Say on Pay Outcome for Fiscal 2017
As the Compensation Committee made its fiscal 2018 compensation decisions, it considered that over 99% of our stockholders who voted on the advisory vote to approve NEO compensation at our last annual meeting of stockholders had voted in favor of approving the compensation. Consistent with this level of support, we continued to implement the compensation policies and practices we have developed in recent years, which we believe reflect a robust "pay for performance" culture within our Company.  Changes to our regular executive compensation program for 2018, which were fairly limited (e.g., reduction in weighting of stock options in our annual long-term incentive awards) were driven by a desire to enhance the retentive aspects of our compensation program. 
Compensation Overview
Our overall executive compensation program is structured to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers by paying them competitively, consistent with our success and their contribution to that success. We believe compensation should be structured to ensure that a significant portion of compensation opportunity will be related to factors that directly and indirectly influence stockholder value.
Total compensation for our NEOs has been allocated between cash and equity compensation taking into consideration the balance between providing short-term incentives and long-term investment in our financial performance to align the interests of management with stockholders. The variable annual incentive award and the equity awards are designed to ensure that total compensation reflects our overall success or failure and to motivate the NEOs to meet appropriate performance measures.
This approach has resulted in a significant weighting of compensation toward variable and long-term incentive compensation awards, which represent a significant majority of the compensation opportunities for our NEOs.  Table of Contents

Determination of Compensation Awards
The Compensation Committee is provided with the authority to determine and approve the compensation awards available to our NEOs and is charged with reviewing our executive compensation policies and practices to ensure adherence to our compensation philosophies and that the total compensation paid to our NEOs is fair, reasonable and competitive, taking into account our position within our industry and the level of expertise and experience of our NEOs in their positions. 
Role of Compensation Consultant
We retained Semler Brossy to provide advice with respect to certain executive compensation matters for fiscal 2018, which included advising on the relevant peer group for PSU awards.  Semler Brossy does not provide any other services to our management. The Compensation Committee has assessed Semler Brossy's independence and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Semler Brossy from providing executive compensation advice to the Compensation Committee.
Use of Peer Group Data
The Compensation Committee reviews competitive pay practices in determining compensation for our executives, including our NEOs, and generally seeks to target individual pay levels that are competitive with the market, which the Compensation Committee views as at or near the 50th percentile of our peer group, which we refer to as "market." The Compensation Committee considers peer group data in determining whether compensation levels in general are reasonably aligned with market levels and whether our compensation practices and policies remain competitive in the markets in which we compete for executive talent and stockholder investment. For fiscal 2018, the peer group consisted of the following companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Base Compensation for Fiscal 2018
We set base salaries for our NEOs generally at a level we deem necessary to attract and retain individuals with superior talent, using the methodologies described above. The Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates base salaries for our NEOs annually, but formulaic base salary increases are not provided to the NEOs. Effective December 21, 2017, Declan Grant received a 2.0% base salary increase that is consistent with the annual merit increases provided to other Company employees.  None of our other NEOs received an increase in their base salary during fiscal 2018.  
Annual Performance-Based Compensation for Fiscal 2018
We structure our compensation programs to reward NEOs based on the Company's performance and the individual executive's contribution to that performance. Under the Management Incentive Plan (the ("MIP"), certain key employees, including NEOs, are eligible to receive annual cash incentive awards in the event certain specified corporate financial performance goals are achieved and based on individual performance considerations.
Under the terms of the MIP, the NEOs have target bonus amounts based upon a percentage of their base salaries. The NEOs' target bonus amounts for fiscal 2018 are set forth in the table below.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Fiscal 2018 Target Bonus 
Name   As% of Base Salary 
Todd Renehan   100 
Kerry Shiba   75 
Alex Murray   75 
Declan Grant   50 
Dan Snow   —(1) 
[END TABLE]
————————————
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) On October 6, 2018, Mr. Snow retired from our Company as Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer and was not eligible to receive a bonus earned for the year 
[END TABLE]
Our NEOs have the ability to earn more or less than their target bonus amounts for over performance or under performance, as determined with reference to the applicable performance goals. None of our NEOs has a guaranteed minimum annual performance bonus.
Awards paid under the MIP are based upon the level of achievement in relation to two Company-wide performance metrics, Bonus EBITDA (40% of MIP opportunity) and Bonus Cash Flow (40% of MIP opportunity), as well as individual performance (20% of MIP opportunity). For this purpose, "Bonus EBITDA" is defined generally as our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation expense and amortization expense, management and transaction fees and extraordinary and non-recurring items. "Bonus Cash Flow" is generally defined as our net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. We use Bonus EBITDA and Bonus Cash Flow as the primary performance metrics to determine the amount of awards paid under our annual bonus plan because the Compensation Committee believes that these metrics most directly correlate to the creation of value for our stockholders in relation to our financial performance over the annual performance period. For fiscal 2018, the calculation of Bonus EBITDA and Bonus Cash Flow excluded Wesco 2020 implementation costs. Individual performance is generally based on personal contributions, as described in more detail below.   Table of Contents
For each performance year, the Compensation Committee assigns a target, threshold and maximum value to each performance metric. The maximum award for each metric is 200% of the target amount, which is payable only upon achievement of maximum-level performance for the metric. Award amounts for performance between the threshold and target, and target and maximum levels increase linearly (from 0% to 100% and 100% to 200%, respectively) depending upon the level of achievement for each metric relative to its approved target value. The Compensation Committee makes final determinations of the amounts payable under the MIP, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer for NEOs other than our Chief Executive Officer, after receipt of the applicable financial information.  
The following chart sets forth the threshold, target and maximum values for each performance metric for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Metric   Threshold ($ MM)  Target ($ MM)  Maximum ($ MM)
Performance Metric   Threshold ($ MM)  Target ($ MM)  Maximum ($ MM)
Bonus EBITDA   135.4   154.7   170.2 
Bonus Cash Flow   35.7   47.6   57.1 
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards
We believe that providing a portion of our NEOs' total compensation using a mix of equity-based awards encourages responsible and profitable growth, encourages executive retention, promotes a long-term focus and aligns executive and stockholder interests. For fiscal 2018, to improve retentive aspects of our long-term incentive awards, equity incentives were granted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Award Type% of Total Equity Incentives   Description/Vesting Terms 
PSUs   25%   Awards vest after three years and are divided into two tranches based on ROIC and TSR 
RSUs   50%   Time-based stock awards vest in three annual installments 
Stock Options   25%   Options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the grant date and vest in three annual installments 
[END TABLE]
As discussed above under the heading "—Compensation Overview," a significant portion of our NEOs' total compensation is weighted toward variable compensation awards. The number of stock options, RSUs and PSUs granted to each of our NEOs in fiscal 2018 and the relative targeted values of those awards are set forth in the following table.  Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name   Number of Shares Subject to Stock Options  (#)   Target Option Award Value  ($)(1)   Number of Restricted Shares  (#)   Target Restricted Stock Award Value ($)(1)   Number of PSUs  (#)(2)   Target PSU Value ($)(1)   Target Total Award Value ($)   Target Total Award Value as a Multiple of Base Salary (#)

[END TABLE]
————————————
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) The targeted value for these awards was determined based on our closing stock price on the grant date of $9.55 per share, and with an estimated value being used for the option awards based on 36.6% of that stock price. The estimated option values used for purposes of this table may not precisely match the amounts shown in the "Option Awards" column of our Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2018, which amounts are based on the accounting grant date fair value of the awards. 
(2) For each NEO, 75% of the PSUs awarded are based on the ROIC metric and 25% of the PSUs awarded are based on the TSR metric. 
[END TABLE]
The PSUs were a component of our compensation program for fiscal 2018. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share (or an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of one share) of our common stock upon vesting. The PSUs will be earned and vest based on the Company's achievement of specific performance goals over a performance period. For fiscal 2018 grants, PSUs may be earned at a level of up to 200% based on (a) ROIC (the "ROIC PSUs") and (b) TSR as compared to the TSR of our peer group (the "TSR PSUs").  The TSR PSUs are measured over a three-year performance period from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2020 and the ROIC PSUs are measured over the performance periods described below.  The Compensation Committee believes that awards of PSUs will incentivize and closely connect our NEOs to long-term performance objectives.
For fiscal 2018 awards, the ROIC PSUs are further divided into three separate tranches, with each tranche representing a one-year performance period as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1/3 of the ROIC PSUs will be earned based on ROIC performance for fiscal year 2018; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1/3 of the ROIC PSUs will be earned based on ROIC performance for fiscal year 2019; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1/3 of the ROIC PSUs will be earned based on ROIC performance for fiscal year 2020. 
[END TABLE]
We implemented this annualized approach to the ROIC PSUs for the first time in fiscal 2018.  In prior years, the ROIC PSUs were measured based on a single performance period, which comprised the final year of the three-year performance period.  We implemented the revised approach in fiscal 2018 to provide better line-of-sight for performance goals to our executives by measuring ROIC performance over shorter successive periods for which we believe we presently can reasonably and reliably forecast financial results.  The ROIC goal for the first annual period was set at the beginning of fiscal 2018 and goals for the successive two annual periods will be set at the beginning of the year to which they relate.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
ROIC =   ROIC Adjusted Net Income   
  Book Value of Invested Capital   
[END TABLE]
For this purpose:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "ROIC Adjusted Net Income" is defined as Adjusted Net Income, as reported in the Company's earnings materials for the applicable fiscal year, plus Tax Adjusted Interest Expense. 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Tax Adjusted Interest Expense" is defined as "interest and other, net," as reported in the Company's earnings materials for the applicable fiscal year, adjusted for the tax effect of that item, which adjustment will be calculated in a manner that is consistent with the "adjustments for tax effect" that are made to Adjusted Net Income. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Invested Capital" is defined as: total assets minus cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, income taxes payable, other liabilities, deferred income taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, net. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The "Book Value of Invested Capital" will be calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal year. 
[END TABLE]
For the 2018 tranche of ROIC PSUs, the number of PSUs earned will be equal to the target number of PSUs in such tranche multiplied by the ROIC Vesting Percentage, which will be determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
ROIC   Tranche 1 Vesting Percentage 
< 8.8%   0% 
>= 8.8% and < 9.8%   50%-100% (1) 
9.8%   100% 
> 9.8% and < 10.8%   100%-200% (1) 
>= 10.8%   200% 
[END TABLE]
___________________
(1)     The ROIC Vesting Percentage will scale linearly relative to the level of ROIC achievement.
For purposes of the TSR PSUs, "TSR" means, as applicable, the Company's or a member of the Peer Group's total stockholder return for the performance period calculated based on the change in trading price of the applicable shares over such period (where the trading price for any date is calculated as the average of the closing price of the applicable shares of stock on the applicable securities exchange, where reasonably available, on such date and on the 20 preceding trading days) and assuming the reinvestment of all dividends and distributions paid on shares during such period.  The "Peer Group" means the companies in our peer group for fiscal 2018, as listed above under the heading "—Compensation Overview—Use of Peer Group Data."
The number of TSR PSUs earned will be equal to the target number awarded multiplied by the vesting percentage, which will be determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
TSR (1)   Vesting Percentage 
< 25th Percentile   0% 
>= 25th and < 50th Percentile   50%-100% (2) 
50th Percentile   100% 
> 50th and < 100th Percentile   100%-200% (2) 
100th Percentile   200% 
[END TABLE]
___________________
(1)    If the Company's TSR is negative over the Performance Period, the vesting percentage will not exceed 100%.
(2)     The vesting percentage will scale linearly relative to the level of TSR achievement.
For fiscal 2018, the NEOs' option, RSU and/or PSU award agreements contain confidentiality and assignment of inventions provisions for our benefit and prohibit executives from soliciting our employees, customers or suppliers to terminate their employment or arrangements, as applicable, with us, and where permitted by law, competing with our business for a period of one year following the termination of the NEO's employment.  If the NEO breaches any of the foregoing covenants, the award will be immediately and automatically cancelled and forfeited for no consideration as of the date of the breach.
PSUs for Performance Period Ending September 30, 2018 Did Not Vest 
In Fiscal 2016, Messrs. Renehan, Murray and Snow each received ROIC PSUs and TSR PSUs with performance being measured over a three-year period that ended as of the end of fiscal 2018.  These awards were structured in a manner similar to the fiscal 2018 PSU awards, except that for the ROIC PSUs, performance was measured 100% based on the Company's ROIC  Table of Contents for the last year of the three-year performance period.  The ROIC threshold, target and maximum performance levels were 16.3%, 17.3% and 18.3%, respectively.  For the three-year performance period ended September 30, 2018, our performance fell below the threshold level for both the ROIC PSUs and the TSR PSUs and none of these awards were earned.
Wesco 2020 Awards 
In connection with our Wesco 2020 initiative, as discussed above under the heading "Executive Summary—Wesco 2020 Initiative," we granted PSUs and RSUs to our NEOs under our 2014 Plan. 
The PSUs vest based on the "Annualized Run Rate Savings" realized in connection with Wesco 2020 and subject to each NEO's continued employment with our Company through the end of the performance period. "Annualized Run Rate Savings" means the applicable "Quarterly Run Rate Savings" multiplied by four, and "Quarterly Run Rate Savings" means our actual cost savings realized in connection with initiatives related to Wesco 2020 for the fiscal quarter of determination, as determined by our Compensation Committee.  
The Compensation Committee will determine the Quarterly Run Rate Savings for the fourth quarter of our Company's fiscal year 2019 as soon as practicable after September 30, 2019.  If, based on such determination, the Annualized Run Rate Savings does not exceed $15 million, then no portion of the award will vest and the award will terminate and be forfeited for no consideration.  If, based on such determination, the Annualized Run Rate Savings exceeds $15 million, then the award will vest and be paid with a number of shares equal to the target number of PSUs subject to the award multiplied by the award percentage as set forth in the following table:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annualized Run Rate Savings Award Percentage (i.e., The Percentage of Target Number of PSUs Earned) 
≤ $15 million 0% 
$20 million 33.33% 
$30 million 100% 
[END TABLE]
The award percentage is interpolated linearly between each applicable level set forth in the table above.  In addition, the PSUs provide an uncapped outperformance opportunity, such that, for each additional $5 million of Annualized Run Rate Savings in excess of $30 million, the Award Percentage is increased by an additional 33.33%, subject to linear interpolation.  The total number of shares to be awarded is subject to final approval by the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee will have discretion to adjust the final award percentage based on our overall performance.
In the event of a change in control during the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the Annualized Run Rate Savings based on the Quarterly Run Rate Savings for the last fiscal quarter ended prior to the consummation of such change-in-control transaction, and the award will vest immediately prior to the consummation of such change-in-control transaction at either (i) the award percentage applicable to such Annualized Run Rate Savings amount pursuant to the table above, or (ii) such greater level as the Compensation Committee may determine in its discretion.    
The grants of RSUs to our NEOs in connection with Wesco 2020 were intended as a special award designed to retain and reward our executives through the critical first phase of the initiative.  In determining whether to grant these special time-vesting awards, our Compensation Committee took into account the low levels at which our annual and long-term incentive awards have been earned in recent years and that these outcomes generally have not been attributable to the performance of our current senior leadership team in their current roles.  The Compensation Committee also considered that these recent award payout levels have caused actual pay for our executives to fall below competitive levels among our peer companies and that performance goals for our outstanding PSU awards scheduled to vest after the end of fiscal 2018 and 2019 were set at levels that are unlikely to be attained.  The committee therefore believed that these awards were important to demonstrate our commitment to providing competitive pay levels to our executives, consistent with peer group standards and the executives' individual and collective contributions to our organization.  The RSU awards are scheduled to vest on December 31, 2018.
In connection with the Wesco 2020 initiative we granted Messrs. Renehan, Shiba, Murray and Grant the following PSUs and RSUs: Table of Contents

Defined Contribution Plans
We have a Section 401(k) Savings/Retirement Plan, or the 401(k) Plan, to cover our eligible employees. The 401(k) Plan permits eligible employees to defer a portion of their annual compensation, subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The employees' elective deferrals are immediately vested and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan. After two full years of employment with us, plan participants vest in matching contributions made by us. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan the first day of the first calendar month following their date of hire. The 401(k) Plan is a safe harbor plan and is offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all of our employees, including NEOs, who meet the eligibility requirements. The Compensation Committee believes that matching and other contributions provided by us assist us in attracting and retaining talented employees and executives. The 401(k) Plan provides an opportunity for participants to save money for retirement on a tax-qualified basis and to achieve financial security, thereby promoting retention. 
Employment and Severance Arrangements - Executive Severance Agreements
The Compensation Committee considers the maintenance of a sound management team to be essential to protecting and enhancing our best interests. To that end, we recognize that the uncertainty that may exist among management with respect to their "at-will" employment with us may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to our detriment. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined that severance arrangements are appropriate to encourage the continued attention and dedication of these members of our management and to allow them to focus on the value to stockholders of strategic alternatives without concern for the impact on their continued employment.
We have entered into severance agreements with each NEO, which provide that, upon our termination of the NEO's employment without cause or by the NEO for good reason (each a "Qualifying Termination"), the NEO will be entitled to, subject to the NEO signing and not revoking a general release of claims, (i) severance payments equal to one times annual base salary; (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination (based on actual Company performance for the fiscal year); (iii) if applicable, continued use of the Company-owned or leased automobile, and reimbursement of operating and maintenance expenses, for six months after the termination date; and (iv) monthly payments of an amount equal to the COBRA premium required to continue group medical, dental and vision coverage for 12 months after the termination date.
If a Qualifying Termination occurs within two years after a change in control of the Company, the severance agreements provide that the NEO will be entitled to, in lieu of the amounts above, (i) severance payments equal to two times the sum of annual base salary plus target annual bonus amount; (ii) if applicable, continued use of the Company-owned or leased automobile, and reimbursement of operating and maintenance expenses, for six months after the termination date; and (iii) monthly payments of an amount equal to the COBRA premium required to continue group medical, dental and vision coverage for 24 months after the termination date. In addition, if a Qualifying Termination occurs within two years after a change in control of the Company, the severance agreements provide that all unvested equity or equity-based awards will fully vest, provided that any such awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions will only be payable subject to the attainment of the performance measures for the applicable performance period as provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement.
The foregoing amounts are in addition to the payment of all earned but unpaid base salary through the termination date and other vested benefits to which the NEO is entitled under the Company's benefit plans and arrangements.
The severance agreements contain non-disparagement and assignment of inventions provisions for our benefit and prohibit executives from soliciting our employees for a period of two years following the termination of the NEO's employment.
The severance agreements have an initial term of three years, subject to automatic extension for successive one-year periods thereafter unless the Company delivers notice of non-renewal to the NEO at least 90 days before the end of the then-current term. If a change in control occurs, the term is automatically extended until the two-year anniversary of the change in  Table of Contents control date. In addition, if a Qualifying Termination occurs, the term is automatically extended as necessary to allow each party's rights and obligations under the severance agreement to be fully satisfied.
"Cause" is defined in each NEO's severance agreement to mean the NEO's (i) material failure to comply with a lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or the NEO's direct supervisor, (ii) willful misconduct, gross negligence or breach of a fiduciary duty that results in material harm to us or our affiliates, (iii) conviction, plea of no contest or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or crime involving moral turpitude, (iv) unlawful use or possession of illegal drugs on our (or our affiliate's) premises or while performing his duties or responsibilities to us or (v) commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation against us or our affiliates. "Good reason" is defined in each NEO's severance agreement to mean (a) a material reduction in duties or responsibilities (other than following a change in control where the NEO remains in a substantially equivalent position), (b) a material reduction in base salary or annual target bonus opportunity, (c) a material change in geographic location at which the NEO must perform his duties (excluding a relocation of the NEO's principal place of employment within a 50-mile radius) or (d) the failure of the Company following an acquisition of all or substantially all of our assets or our business (whether by purchase, merger or otherwise) to obtain an agreement from any successor to assume and agree to perform the severance agreement.
Other Elements of Compensation and Perquisites
Our NEOs are eligible under the same plans as all other employees for medical, dental, vision and short-term disability insurance. In addition, we provide our NEOs with the personal use of Company automobiles and in certain instances dues related to country club memberships, which our NEOs use for both personal and professional purposes. We provide these benefits due to their relatively low cost and the high value they provide in attracting and retaining talented executives.
Policies and Other Considerations
Stock Ownership Policy
We believe that direct ownership in our Company provides our NEOs with a strong incentive to increase the value of our Company. Historically, our NEOs have held significant ownership positions in our Company and we have adopted formal stock ownership requirements to ensure continued meaningful equity ownership by our executives. Under the policy, our Chief Executive Officer and all other executive officers must hold 50% of the net settled shares received from the vesting, delivery or exercise of equity awards granted under the Company's equity award plans until such time as they meet their applicable stock ownership threshold. The stock ownership threshold for our Chief Executive Officer is five times his annual base salary. The stock ownership threshold for all others covered by the policy is three times their annual base salary. The stock ownership policy also applies to our directors who receive compensation for their service as a director. The stock ownership threshold for such directors is three times their annual retainer, and such directors must also hold 50% of net settled shares until they reach their stock ownership threshold.
Clawback Policy
In November 2018, we adopted the Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. Clawback Policy (the "Clawback Policy"). Our Clawback Policy applies to bonuses and/or equity-based awards granted to individuals who participate in our MIP or equity incentive programs. In the event of a restatement of our financial statements to correct a material error or inaccuracy that the Board, or one of its committees, determines resulted in whole or in part from the fraud or intentional misconduct of a participant, the Board, or an applicable committee thereof, will review all bonuses and equity-based awards paid or vested with respect to a participant on the basis of having met or exceeded performance goal(s) for performance periods beginning after fiscal year 2018. If it is determined that a lesser bonus or award would have been paid or vested with based upon the restated financial results, the Board, or an applicable committee thereof, may seek to recover or cause to be forfeited for the benefit of our Company the amount by which the participant's bonus or award for the restated period exceeded such lesser bonus or award, plus a reasonable rate of interest. In addition, the Board or its applicable committee may cause the cancellation of the participant's outstanding bonus or equity-based award opportunities and recovery of any additional amounts relating to prior bonuses or equity-based awards paid or vested with respect to the participant under our MIP or applicable equity incentive programs.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Each of Messrs. Renehan, Shiba, Murray and Grant has an agreement that provides for severance benefits upon a termination of employment. See "—Employment and Severance Arrangements - Executive Severance Agreements" above for a description of the severance agreements. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the PSUs granted to each NEO in connection with our Wesco 2020 initiative will vest at the level of performance attained prior to such change in control as described above under the heading "—Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards—Wesco 2020 Awards." The table below summarizes the severance payments and benefits that would be made to each of these NEOs upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Termination of employment or Qualifying Termination within two years after a change in control, assuming that his termination of employment occurred on September 30, 2018. Because Mr. Snow terminated employment prior to the end of fiscal 2018, he is not included in the table below.

(4) Consists of continued use of the Company-owned or leased automobile, and reimbursement of operating and maintenance expenses. The value of continued use was calculated by taking one-half of the applicable NEO's fiscal 2018 car allowance.  
(5) Consists of continuation of group health benefits. The value of the health benefits was calculated using an estimate of the cost to us of such health coverage based upon past experience.  
(6) Amounts represent the aggregate value of the NEO's unvested restricted stock and stock options that would have vested on the applicable event. The value of the accelerated restricted stock was calculated by multiplying (x) the number of shares subject to the acceleration by (y) by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on September 28, 2018 ($11.25). The value of the accelerated stock option was calculated by multiplying (x) the number of shares subject to acceleration by (y) the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on September 28, 2018 ($11.25) over the per share exercise price of the accelerated option.  
(7) Vesting of performance-based restricted stock awards is subject to attainment of applicable performance goals at the end of the performance period. Amount shown assumes that performance goals are ultimately attained.  
(8) Amounts realized in respect of PSU awards will be determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee based on our achievement of performance conditions at the time of the change in control. Amount shown is the target value of the PSUs based on our closing stock price on September 28, 2018 of $11.25 per share; however, the actual amount received by the NEOs in respect of their PSU awards may be more or less depending on our actual performance as measured at the time of the change in control. For additional information about the PSUs, please see "—Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards—Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards."  For Wesco 2020 PSUs, amounts payable in connection with a change in control will be determined based on the annualized run rate savings for the most recently completed quarter ended prior to the date of the change in control.  As of September 30, 3018, the amount payable in respect of these awards would be zero.

Compensation Risk
We have analyzed the potential risks arising from our compensation policies and practices, and have determined that there are no such risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 
Director Compensation for Fiscal 2018
Directors who are our employees or employees of Carlyle (Messrs. Renehan, Palmer and Baird) receive no additional compensation for serving on our Board or its committees.
For their services as a member of our Board in fiscal 2018, each of our "non-employee" directors received a retainer of $150,000 ($200,000 for Mr. Snyder who serves as Chairman of the Board) and an additional payment for serving on one or more of our committees. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to pay the annual retainer either 50% in cash and 50% in shares of our restricted common stock or 100% in shares of our restricted common stock, at the election of the applicable director. The shares were granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and vested quarterly over the remainder of the year. The cash payments were also paid quarterly. The number of shares for the fiscal 2018 retainer was determined based on the fair market value of the shares on grant date.
In fiscal 2018, we provided the following compensation to our non-employee directors:

Equity Compensation Plan Information

Pay Ratio Disclosure
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship between the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Renehan, our Chief Executive Officer. We consider the pay ratio specified herein to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We believe executive pay must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay our NEOs receive and the pay our non-managerial employees receive.
Mr. Renehan had fiscal 2018 annual total compensation of $2,759,868 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Our median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 was $37,161, as determined in the same manner as the total compensation for Mr. Renehan. Based on this information, for 2018, the estimated ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our CEO) to the annual compensation of our CEO was 74 to 1. 
 To identify the median employee from our employee population, we determined the annual total compensation of each of our employees as of September 1, 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. We considered all Company employees, including international employees and those working less than 40 hours per week, and included total annual cash compensation for purposes of determining the median employee, noting that employees near the median do not receive stock compensation or other perquisites as part of their compensation package.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Management Agreement
On September 29, 2006, the Company entered into a management agreement with TC Group, L.L.C. ("TC Group"), an affiliate of Carlyle, to provide certain financial, strategic advisory and consultancy services to the Company, and on July 27, 2011, upon the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement"), that agreement was amended and restated (as amended, the "Management Agreement") in order to substitute TC Group with Carlyle Investment Management, L.L.C. ("CIM"). Under the Management Agreement, we are obligated to pay CIM (or, prior to July 27, 2011, TC Group) an annual management fee of $1.0 million (paid quarterly) and to pay or reimburse CIM (or, prior to July 27, 2011, TC Group) for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The management fee was waived by CIM for fiscal 2018 and we paid expenses of approximately $0.1 million during fiscal 2018 related to the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement will terminate at such time as CIM or one or more of its affiliates no longer collectively control, in the aggregate, at least 15% of the Company's common stock, or such earlier date as the Company and CIM may mutually agree.
Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement
In connection with the acquisition of the Company by Carlyle, on September 29, 2006, we entered into a stockholders agreement with Falcon Aerospace Holdings, LLC, Randy Snyder, Susan Snyder, certain trusts holding shares of our common stock and members of management holding restricted shares of our common stock or options to purchase common stock. The stockholders agreement was amended on November 30, 2007 and further amended on April 17, 2008. Upon effectiveness of the Registration Statement on July 27, 2011, the stockholders agreement was amended and restated (the "Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement").
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, the Carlyle Stockholders currently have the right to nominate three of the members of the Board, the Wesco Stockholders have the right to nominate one of the members of the Board and the Board or a committee of the Board has the right to nominate the remaining directors, subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement. The number of Board members that the Carlyle Stockholders are entitled to nominate will be reduced to two directors if the Carlyle Stockholders hold less than 15% of our common stock and one director if the Carlyle Stockholders hold less than 10% of our common stock. The Carlyle Stockholders' rights under the nomination provisions of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement will terminate at such time as they hold less than 5% of our common stock. The Wesco Stockholders' rights under the nominations provisions of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement will also terminate at such time as they hold less than 5% of our common stock. In addition, for so long as Randy Snyder remains involved with our business, Mr. Snyder must be the Wesco Stockholders' nominee. However, at such time as Mr. Snyder is no longer involved with our business, the Wesco Stockholders may nominate another director, provided that such nominee is deemed qualified to serve on the Board of a public company.
The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement contains restrictions on the transfer of our equity securities by the stockholders, as well as drag-along rights. In the event that we register any of our common stock following our initial public offering, these stockholders have the right to require us to use our best efforts to include the securities held by them, subject to certain limitations, including as determined by the underwriters, and have the right to cause us to effect registrations of shares on their behalf. The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement also requires us to indemnify the stockholders in connection with any such registration of our securities.
The Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement terminates upon (i) a sale or change in control of the Company, (ii) such date as neither the Carlyle Stockholders nor the Wesco Stockholders in the aggregate hold 5% or more of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock or (iii) the approval of the Company and its stockholders who are parties to the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement.
Operating Leases
We lease several office and warehouse facilities under operating lease agreements (the "Operating Lease Agreements") from entities affiliated with or controlled by Randy J. Snyder, who currently serves as our Chairman of the Board and is also a minority stockholder of the Company. Rent expense on these facilities was approximately $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Operating Lease Agreements expire by their terms between June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Table of Contents
Employee Arrangements

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, Todd Snyder's total compensation (consisting of his annual base salary, bonus payments, stock-based compensation and other benefits) was approximately $315,000.  Justin Snyder, who is also the son of Randy J. Snyder and an employee of the Company, serves as Manager of Strategic Supply Chain.

Compensation for both Todd Snyder and Justin Snyder was determined in accordance with our standard employment and compensation practices applicable to employees with similar responsibilities and positions. 
Related Person Transaction Policy
We have adopted a written policy relating to the evaluation of and the approval, disapproval and monitoring of transactions involving us and "related persons." For the purposes of the policy, "related persons" include our executive officers, directors and director nominees or their immediate family members, or stockholders owning 5% or more of our outstanding common stock.
Our related person transactions policy requires:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that any transaction in which a related person has a material direct or indirect interest and that exceeds $120,000 (a "related person transaction"), and any material amendment or modification to a related person transaction, be evaluated and approved or ratified by our Audit Committee or by the disinterested members of the Audit Committee, as applicable; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that any employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer and any related compensation solely resulting from that employment relationship or transaction must be approved by the Compensation Committee or recommended by the Compensation Committee to our Board for its approval. 
[END TABLE]
In connection with the review and approval or ratification of a related person transaction:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• management must disclose to the Audit Committee or the disinterested members of the Audit Committee, as applicable, the material terms of the related person transaction, including the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the transaction, and all the material facts as to the related person's direct or indirect interest in, or relationship to, the related person transaction; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• management must advise the Audit Committee or the disinterested members of the Audit Committee, as applicable, as to whether the related person transaction complies with the terms of the agreements governing our material outstanding indebtedness; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• management must advise the Audit Committee or the disinterested members of the Audit Committee, as applicable, as to whether the related person transaction will be required to be disclosed in our SEC filings. To the extent it is required to be disclosed, management must ensure that the related person transaction is disclosed in accordance with SEC rules; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• management must advise the Audit Committee or the disinterested members of the Audit Committee, as applicable, as to whether the related person transaction constitutes a "personal loan" for purposes of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the related person transaction policy provides that the Audit Committee, in connection with any approval or ratification of a related person transaction involving a non-employee director or director nominee, should consider whether such transaction would compromise the director or director nominee's status as an "independent," "outside," or "non-employee" director, as applicable, under the rules and regulations of the SEC, the applicable listing exchange and the Internal Revenue Code.
All related person transactions described in this section, with the exception of Todd Snyder's and Justin Snyder's respective employment arrangements, occurred prior to adoption of this policy, and as such, these transactions were not subject to the approval and review procedures described above.  Todd Snyder's and Justin Snyder's employment arrangements were both ratified by Audit Committee in accordance with these approval and review procedures. Table of Contents
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own, or are part of a group that owns, more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by regulation of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on our review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments thereto and other information obtained from our directors and officers and certain 10% stockholders or otherwise available to us, we believe that no director, officer or beneficial owners of more than 10% of our total outstanding common shares failed to file the reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on a timely basis during fiscal 2018. Table of Contents
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
As of November 30, 2018, there were a total of 99,626,255 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. As of November 30, 2018, certain affiliates of Carlyle owned approximately 23.4% of our common stock.
The following table sets forth, as of November 30, 2018, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each director, director nominee and NEO; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all of our directors and executive officers as a group. 
[END TABLE]
Such information (other than with respect to our directors and executive officers and their affiliates) is based on a review of statements filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Exchange Act with respect to our common stock.
The amounts and percentages of shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of SEC regulations governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial" owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Securities that can be so acquired are not deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing any other person's percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest.
Except as otherwise indicated in these footnotes, each of the beneficial owners listed has, to our knowledge, sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of capital stock and the business address of each such beneficial owner is c/o Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc., 24911 Avenue Stanford, Valencia, California 91355.

PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL ON AN ADVISORY BASIS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs.
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our NEOs, who are critical to our success. Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 19 for additional details about our executive compensation programs. We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2018 and the other related tables and disclosure."
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and intend to consider our stockholders' views regarding our executive compensation programs.
Vote Required; Recommendation
The approval by a non-binding advisory vote of our executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
        OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. Table of Contents
PROPOSAL 3
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S 2014 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN
Summary of the Proposal to Increase the Shares Available for Issuance
The following information relates to the recommendation of the Board that the shareholders of the Company approve the Plan Amendment to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan by 5,000,000, bringing the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan after September 30, 2014 from 7,000,819 to 12,000,819.  The Company is seeking shareholder approval so that it may continue granting awards under the 2014 Plan in order to provide additional incentives to selected employees, directors and consultants, to strengthen commitment, motivate the diligent performance of responsibilities and attract and retain competent and dedicated persons whose efforts should result in our long-term growth and profitability. 
The Board believes that it is in the Company's best interest that the 2014 Plan be amended to increase the number of authorized shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan in order to continue to provide equity incentive opportunities over the coming years.  The key factors considered by the Board in determining the number of additional shares to reserve under the 2014 Plan and the material terms of the 2014 Plan are described in this proposal below.  If our shareholders do not approve this proposal, the 2014 Plan will remain in effect under its current terms (i.e., without the increased number of shares available for grant).
The 2014 Plan was originally adopted by the Board of Directors on November 12, 2014 as an amendment and restatement of the Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan, and is the only shareholder approved equity compensation plan that we currently maintain.  The 2014 Plan was approved by our shareholders on January 27, 2015.  The Board believes that the effective use of performance-based cash incentive awards and stock-based long-term incentive compensation has been integral to the Company's success in the past and is vital to its ability to achieve continued strong performance in the future.  The Board believes that grants of equity awards will help to create long-term participation in the Company and, thereby, assist us in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding employees, directors and consultants.  The use of long-term equity grants allows the Board to align the incentives of the Company's employees, directors and consultants with the interests of its shareholders, linking compensation to Company performance.  The use of equity awards as compensation also allows the Company to conserve cash resources for other important purposes.  Accordingly, the Board believes that approval of the Plan Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and the Board recommends that shareholders vote for approval of the Plan Amendment.
Key 2014 Plan Terms
The Plan Amendment does not make any changes to the 2014 Plan, other than to increase the number of shares available for issuance thereunder.  We believe that the 2014 Plan contains many provisions that are consistent with good practices in equity compensation and which we believe protect our shareholders' interests.  These provisions include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued Broad-Based Eligibility for Equity Awards.  We grant equity awards to a meaningful number of our executive and non-executive level employees and all of our non-employee directors.  By doing so, we link employee and director interests with stockholder interests throughout the organization and motivate these individuals to act as owners of the business. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No "Evergreen" Provision.  The 2014 Plan does not contain an "evergreen" provision to increase the number of shares available for grants each year.  Any increase to the maximum number of shares available requires shareholder approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limitations on Share Recycling.  Shares tendered by participants to satisfy the exercise price or tax withholding obligation of an option are not "added back" to the shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.  Shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise, and shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options, are also not added back to the shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Director Award Limit.  A grant-date fair value limit of $500,000 per year applies to awards to non-employee directors.  Additional annual award limits also apply for other participants.  For additional information, see the discussion below under "—Description of the 2014 Plan—Award Limits." 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Repricing of Awards.  The 2014 Plan affirmatively provides that awards may not be repriced, replaced or regranted through cancellation or modification without stockholder approval if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the shares under the award. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Discount Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.  The 2014 Plan requires that all stock options and stock appreciation rights have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock option or stock appreciation right is granted. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Dividend Payments on Performance-Based Awards.  Dividends and dividend equivalents may be paid on awards subject to performance vesting conditions only to the extent such conditions are met. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Single Trigger Vesting.  No provision contained within the 2014 Plan provides for single-trigger accelerated vesting upon a change in control. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Tax Gross-Ups.  The 2014 Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups. 
[END TABLE]

• Following the grant of our regular annual equity awards for fiscal year 2019, we estimate that we do not have enough shares remaining available for issuance under the 2014 Plan to cover our next round of annual equity incentive awards.  Therefore, unless an increase is approved, we would lose an important compensation tool aligned with shareholder interests to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified talent. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Plan Amendment is approved, we estimate that the shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan would be sufficient for approximately three to four years of awards, assuming we grant awards consistent with our projections and noting that future circumstances may require us to change our equity grant practices.  Based on the foregoing, we expect that we would require an additional increase to the share reserve under the 2014 Plan in fiscal years 2022 or 2023 (primarily dependent on award levels/amounts and hiring activity during the next few  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents years), noting again that the share reserve could last for a longer or shorter period of time, depending on our future equity grant practices, which we cannot predict with any degree of certainty at this time.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The total aggregate equity value of the five million additional authorized shares being requested under the Plan Amendment, based on the closing price for one share of our Common Stock on September 28, 2018 is $56,250,000.  Based upon its analysis, Semler Brossy concluded that our shareholder value transfer for the entire 2014 Plan as a percentage of market capitalization and inclusive of the shares already reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan which remain available under the 2014 Plan (but not including awards already granted under the 2014 Plan or a prior plan) was approximately 7%. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our current overhang rate, calculated by dividing (i) the number of shares subject to equity awards outstanding at the end of the fiscal year plus the number of shares remaining available for issuance under our 2014 Plan by (ii) the number of Company shares outstanding at the end of the fiscal year on a fully diluted basis, is approximately 6.7%, which is below the 25th percentile of companies in our peer group.  If the Plan Amendment is approved, the issuance of the additional shares to be reserved under the 2014 Plan would dilute the holdings of shareholders by approximately an additional 5.0% on a fully diluted basis, increasing our overhang rate to approximately 11.7%, which is near the 75th percentile of companies in our peer group.  However, our overhang level will decrease in subsequent years as we issue shares from the 2014 Plan and stock options are exercised. 
[END TABLE]
In light of the factors described above, and the fact that the ability to continue to grant equity compensation is vital to our ability to continue to attract and retain employees in the competitive labor markets in which we compete, the Board has determined that the size of the share reserve under the Plan Amendment is reasonable and appropriate at this time.  The Board will not create a subcommittee to evaluate the risks and benefits for issuing the additional authorized shares requested.
Description of the 2014 Plan
The following sets forth a description of the material features and terms of the 2014 Plan.  The description of the 2014 Plan is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the 2014 Plan, which is filed hereto as Appendix A, and the Plan Amendment, which is filed hereto as Appendix B. 
Administration.  The 2014 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee or a subcommittee thereof (or by the Board or another Board committee as may be determined by the Board from time to time).  The administrator of the 2014 Plan (the "Administrator") has the authority to interpret the 2014 Plan, determine the types and number of awards, the number of shares to be awarded, to approve all awards made under the 2014 Plan, and carry out other functions as set forth in the 2014 Plan.  To the extent allowed by law, the Administrator may delegate the authority to grant awards or take other administrative actions under the 2014 Plan to certain officers of the Company, subject to the limitations and restrictions set by the Administrator.  Notwithstanding its authority to delegate, the full Board must administer the 2014 Plan with respect to awards granted to non-employee directors.
Award Limits.  The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to awards granted under the 2014 Plan from and after September 30, 2014 will increase from 7,000,819 to 12,000,819 shares, plus, subject to certain limitations, shares covered by previously granted awards that are forfeited, expire or lapse, or are paid in cash.  For additional information about the shares which may be added to the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan, see the discussion below under the heading "—Share Counting Provisions."  The 2014 Plan also includes annual limits on awards that may be granted to any individual participant.  For participants other than non-employee directors, if the award is denominated in shares of Common Stock, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted to any one person is 750,000 per year.  If the award is payable in cash and not denominated in shares of Common Stock, the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid to any one person is $7,500,000 per year.  The maximum aggregate grant date fair value of awards granted to a non-employee director under the 2014 Plan is $500,000 per year.
Share Counting Provisions.  In general, when previously granted awards expire, lapse, are forfeited or are paid in cash, the shares reserved for those awards are returned or added, as applicable, to the share reserve and available for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.  However, the 2014 Plan does not allow the share pool available for incentive grants to be recharged or replenished with shares that:

• are tendered or withheld to satisfy withholding obligations for an option or stock appreciation right;

[END TABLE]
Eligibility.  Employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (as defined in the 2014 Plan) who, in the opinion of the Administrator, are in a position to make a significant contribution to the success of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 2014 Plan.  The Administrator determines the type and size of the award and sets the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the award within the confines of the 2014 Plan's terms.  As of September 30, 2018, we had in total 3,075 employees and eligible consultants and 10 non-employee directors.  However, based on historic compensation practices, approximately 95 individuals are eligible to receive awards; however, this number is subject to change as the number of individuals in our business is adjusted to meet our operational requirements. 
Types of Awards.  The 2014 Plan authorizes the grant of the following types of incentive awards to eligible individuals: a performance award, a restricted stock award, a restricted stock unit award, a dividend equivalent award, a stock payment award, a stock appreciation right or a stock option; any of which may be awarded in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan.  Awards to eligible individuals shall be subject to the terms of an individual award agreement between the Company and the individual, which must be approved indicating its acceptance by the participant.
Performance Awards.  Performance Awards include any of the awards that are granted subject to vesting and/or payment based on the attainment of specified performance goals (including performance-based stock and cash incentive awards).  Performance Awards may be made to any eligible individual under the 2014 Plan.  The Administrator determines the specific performance goals and criteria to be applied to determine vesting or payment of each award, and the time periods over which performance is measured.  Performance Awards only vest if the specific performance goals or criteria are met, and may be paid to the recipient as cash incentive payments, shares of stock or a combination of cash and shares.  Performance Awards are forfeited if the performance goals are not satisfied by the conclusion of the performance period. 
Restricted Stock.  The Administrator may make awards of restricted stock to eligible individuals in such amounts and at purchase prices to be established by the Administrator in connection with each award.  Such awards are subject to restrictions and other terms and conditions as are established by the Administrator.  Upon issuance of restricted stock, recipients generally have the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares, subject to the limitations and restrictions established by the Administrator in the award program or the individual award agreement.  Such rights generally include the right to receive dividends and other distributions in relation to the award; however, no dividends are payable with respect to restricted stock with performance-based vesting unless and until the performance conditions have been satisfied.  Except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, restricted stock awards will lapse and immediately be surrendered to the Company without payment of consideration if the recipient terminates service to the Company before the restrictions on the award have expired.
Restricted Stock Units.  The 2014 Plan authorizes awards of restricted stock units to eligible individuals in amounts and at purchase prices and upon such other terms and conditions as are established by the Administrator for each award.  Restricted stock unit awards entitle recipients to acquire shares of the Company's stock in the future under certain conditions.  Holders of restricted stock units generally have no rights of ownership or as shareholders in relation to the award, unless and until the restrictions lapse and the restricted stock unit award vests in accordance with the terms of the grant and actual shares are issued in settlement of the award.  Restricted stock units are often granted in tandem with Dividend Equivalents, which are described below, however, no dividend equivalents are payable with respect to Restricted Stock Units with performance-based vesting unless and until the performance conditions have been satisfied.
Dividend Equivalents.  Dividend equivalents may be granted by the Administrator based on the dividends declared on Common Stock of the Company between the date of the award and the date that the award vests, is exercised, distributed or expires.  Dividend equivalents are converted to cash or additional shares of stock based on terms and limitations established by the Administrator.  In addition, dividend equivalents with respect to an award with performance-based vesting that are based on dividends paid prior to the vesting of such award will only be paid out to the holder to the extent that the performance-based vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the award vests.
Stock Payments.  The Administrator is authorized to make stock payments to any eligible individual under the 2014 Plan.  Stock payments may be made in lieu of base salary, cash incentives, fees or other cash compensation otherwise payable to the recipient.  The number or value of shares to be awarded, conditions and criteria for vesting, and the vesting schedule, are set by the Administrator.  Holders of stock payment awards have no rights as a shareholder until the stock payment has vested and the shares underlying the award have been issued. Table of Contents
Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Administrator is authorized to grant stock appreciation rights to eligible recipients in its discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, consistent with the 2014 Plan.  A stock appreciation right entitles the holder to exercise the stock appreciation right to acquire shares of the Company's stock upon exercise within a specified time period from the date of the grant.  Subject to the provisions of the stock appreciation right award agreement, the recipient may receive from the Company an amount determined by multiplying the difference between the price per share of the stock appreciation right and the value of the share on the date of exercise by the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the award.  The maximum term for which stock appreciation rights may be exercisable under the 2014 Plan is ten years.
Stock Options.  Stock options may be granted under the 2014 Plan, including both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, which provide the holder a right to purchase shares of Common Stock at a specified exercise price.  The exercise price per share for each stock option shall be set by the Administrator, but shall not be less than the fair market value on the date of the grant (or 110% of the price of an incentive stock option in the case of an individual who, on the date of the grant, owns or is deemed to own shares representing more than 10% of the stock of the Company).  The term of any option award may not be longer than ten years (or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% shareholder of the Company).  The Administrator will determine the time period for exercise of each award, including the time period for exercise following a termination of service by the recipient, subject to the ten-year limitation.
Incentive Stock Options.  Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees of the Company.  No person who qualifies as a greater-than-10% shareholder of the Company may be granted an incentive stock option, unless such incentive stock option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code.
Non-Qualified Stock Options.  With the consent of the holder, the Administrator is authorized to modify any incentive stock option granted under the 2014 Plan to disqualify the option from treatment as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code.
Prohibition on Re-pricing.  Under the 2014 Plan, the Administrator may not, without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, authorize the re-pricing of any outstanding option or stock appreciation right to reduce its price per share, or cancel any option or stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or another award when the price per share exceeds the Fair Market Value (as that term is defined in the 2014 Plan) of the underlying shares.
Change in Control.  In general, notwithstanding a Change in Control event (as that term is defined in the 2014 Plan), each outstanding award shall continue in effect or be assumed or an equivalent award substituted by the successor corporation.  No provisions for single-trigger vesting acceleration in connection with a Change in Control are contained within the 2014 Plan.  However, in the event the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the award the Administrator shall cause any or all of such awards to become fully vested and, if applicable, exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction and all forfeiture restrictions to lapse, and so notify the holder.  Regardless of any Change in Control, no adjustment will be authorized that would cause the 2014 Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code, or would result in short swing profits under Section 16 of the Exchange Act or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, unless the Administrator determines the award is not to comply with such exemptive conditions.
Certain Transactions.  The Administrator has broad discretion to equitably adjust the provisions of the 2014 Plan, as well as the terms and conditions of existing and future awards, to prevent the dilution or enlargement of intended benefits and facilitate necessary or desirable changes in the event of certain transactions and events affecting our Common Stock, such as stock dividends, stock splits, combinations or exchanges of shares, mergers, consolidations or other distributions (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to shareholders.  In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions with our shareholders known as "equity restructurings," the Administrator will make equitable adjustments to outstanding awards.
Amendment and Termination.  The Administrator or the Board may amend, modify, suspend or terminate the 2014 Plan, as it deems necessary or appropriate in the best interests of the Company, without the approval of shareholders.  However, the Administrator must obtain the consent of any award holder before taking any action that materially impairs any rights or obligations of the holder (unless the award expressly provides otherwise).  Further, it may not, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, make any amendment to the 2014 Plan that would: (i) increase the limits on the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2014 Plan; (ii) decrease the share price of outstanding stock option or stock appreciation rights granted under the 2014 Plan; or (iii) cancel any stock option or stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or another award when the option or stock appreciation right price per share exceeds the fair market value of the underlying shares.
The 2014 Plan provides that in no event may an award be granted pursuant to the 2014 Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the date the 2014 Plan was approved by our Board, which occurred on November 12, 2014. Table of Contents
Forfeiture and Clawbacks.  The 2014 Plan provides the Administrator with the authority to require, in an award agreement or otherwise, that an individual in receipt of any award agree that any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit obtained in connection with any award, must be repaid to the Company (and the award shall terminate and any exercisable portion be forfeited), if the holder is terminated before a specified date or within a specified time period following receipt or exercise of the award, terminated for cause (as such term is defined by the Administrator), or engages in any activity in competition with the Company or which is inimical, contrary or harmful to the Company's interests (as further defined by the Administrator).  In addition, all awards made under the 2014 Plan are subject to any clawback policy implemented by the Company, including any clawback policy adopted to comply with the requirements of applicable law (including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder).
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences.  The following summary is based on an analysis of the Code as currently in effect, existing laws, judicial decisions, administrative rulings, regulations and proposed regulations, all of which are subject to change.  Moreover, the following is only a summary of United States federal income tax consequences.  Actual tax consequences to participants may be either more or less favorable than those described below depending on the participants' particular circumstances.
Incentive Stock Options.  No income will be recognized by a participant for federal income tax purposes upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option.  The basis of shares transferred to a participant upon exercise of an incentive stock option is the price paid for the shares.  If the participant holds the shares for at least one year after the transfer of the shares to the participant, and two years after the grant of the option, the participant will recognize capital gain or loss upon sale of the shares received upon exercise equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the basis of the stock.  Generally, if the shares are not held for that period, the participant will recognize ordinary income upon disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares, or if less (and if the disposition is a transaction in which loss, if any, will be recognized), the gain on disposition.  Any additional gain realized by the participant upon the disposition will be a capital gain.  The excess of the fair market value of shares received upon the exercise of an incentive stock option over the option price for the shares is an item of adjustment for the participant for purposes of the alternative minimum tax.  Therefore, although no income is recognized upon exercise of an incentive stock option, a participant may be subject to alternative minimum tax as a result of the exercise.
Non-qualified Stock Options. No income is expected to be recognized by a participant for federal income tax purposes upon the grant of a non-qualified stock option.  Upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares.  Income recognized upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option will be considered compensation subject to withholding at the time the income is recognized, and, therefore, the participant's employer must make the necessary arrangements with the participant to ensure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is available for payment.  Non-qualified stock options are designed to provide the employer with a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant at the time of the recognition by the participant, subject to the deduction limitations described below.
Stock Appreciation Rights.  There is expected to be no federal income tax consequences to either the participant or the employer upon the grant of stock appreciation rights.  Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of payment pursuant to stock appreciation rights in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value of any Common Stock received.  Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Restricted Stock.  If the restrictions on an award of shares of restricted stock are of a nature that the shares are both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and are not freely transferable (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code), the participant will not recognize income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the award unless the participant affirmatively elects to include the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the award, less any amount paid for the shares, in gross income for the year of the award pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code.  In the absence of this election, the participant will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes on the date the shares either become freely transferable or are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code), the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on such date, less any amount paid for the shares.  The employer will be entitled to a deduction at the time of income recognition to the participant in an amount equal to the amount the participant is required to include in income with respect to the shares, subject to the deduction limitations described below.  If a Section 83(b) election is made within 30 days after the date the restricted stock is received, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of the receipt of the restricted stock, and the employer will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time, less the amount paid, if any, by the participant for the restricted stock.  If a Section 83(b) election is made, no additional income will be recognized by the participant upon the lapse  Table of Contents of restrictions on the restricted stock, but, if the restricted stock is subsequently forfeited, the participant may not deduct the income that was recognized pursuant to the Section 83(b) election at the time of the receipt of the restricted stock.
Dividends paid to a participant holding restricted stock before the expiration of the restriction period will be additional compensation taxable as ordinary income to the participant subject to withholding, unless the participant made an election under Section 83(b).  Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the dividends includible in the participant's income as compensation.  If the participant has made a Section 83(b) election, the dividends will be dividend income, rather than additional compensation, to the participant.
If the restrictions on an award of restricted stock are not of a nature that the shares are both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not freely transferable, within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code, the participant will recognize ordinary income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the transfer of the shares in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the transfer, less any amount paid therefore.  The employer will be entitled to a deduction at that time in an amount equal to the amount the participant is required to include in income with respect to the shares, subject to the deduction limitations described below.
Restricted Stock Units.  There will be no federal income tax consequences to either the participant or the employer upon the grant of restricted stock units.  Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or transfer of shares of Common Stock in payment of the restricted stock units in an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash received and the fair market value of the Common Stock so transferred.  Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Performance Awards.  There will be no federal income tax consequences to either the participant or the employer upon the grant of performance awards.  Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or shares of Common Stock in payment of performance awards in an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash received and the fair market value of the Common Stock so transferred.  Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Dividend Equivalents.  Generally, a participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the payment of any dividend equivalents paid with respect to an award in an amount equal to the cash the participant receives.  Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Limitations on the Employer's Compensation Deduction.  Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deduction certain employers may take for otherwise deductible compensation payable to certain executive officers of the employer to the extent the compensation paid to such an officer for the year exceeds $1 million.  Although the 2014 Plan contains provisions, including individual annual award limitations, that, under prior tax laws, were designed to allow the Company to structure certain awards as qualified "performance based compensation" that might have been exempt from Section 162(m)'s deduction disallowance, such exemption no longer applies under current law and all future awards granted under the 2014 Plan to covered executives will be subject to deduction limitations under Section 162(m).
Excess Parachute Payments. Section 280G of the Code limits the deduction that the employer may take for otherwise deductible compensation payable to certain individuals if the compensation constitutes an "excess parachute payment."  Excess parachute payments arise from payments made to disqualified individuals that are in the nature of compensation and are contingent on changes in ownership or control of the employer or certain affiliates.  Accelerated vesting or payment of awards under the 2014 Plan upon a change in ownership or control of the employer or its affiliates could result in excess parachute payments.  In addition to the deduction limitation applicable to the employer, a disqualified individual receiving an excess parachute payment is subject to a 20% excise tax on the amount thereof.
Application of Section 409A of the Code.  Section 409A of the Code imposes an additional 20% tax and interest on an individual receiving non-qualified deferred compensation under a plan that fails to satisfy certain requirements.  For purposes of Section 409A, "non-qualified deferred compensation" includes equity-based incentive programs, including some stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit programs.  Generally speaking, Section 409A does not apply to incentive stock options, non-discounted non-qualified stock options and appreciation rights if no deferral is provided beyond exercise, or restricted stock. Table of Contents
The awards made pursuant to the 2014 Plan are expected to be designed in a manner intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent the awards granted under the 2014 Plan are not exempt from coverage.  However, if the 2014 Plan fails to comply with Section 409A in operation, a participant could be subject to the additional taxes and interest.
State and local tax consequences may in some cases differ from the federal tax consequences.  The foregoing summary of the income tax consequences in respect of the 2014 Plan is for general information only.  Interested parties should consult their own advisors as to specific tax consequences of their awards.
The 2014 Plan is not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

PROPOSAL 4
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has been our independent audit firm since September 29, 2006, has been appointed by our Audit Committee as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and our Audit Committee has further directed that the appointment of such accountants be submitted for ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. We have been advised by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that neither that firm nor any of its associates has any relationship with us or our subsidiaries other than the usual relationship that exists between independent auditors and clients. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will be provided an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate inquiries from stockholders.
Stockholder ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors is not required by our bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, committee charters or otherwise. However, our Board is submitting the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of what it considers to be good corporate practice. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if our Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in our and our stockholders' best interests.

We will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement and our annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of either of those documents was delivered. To make such a request, please contact Broadridge, Householding Department by phone at 1-866-540-7095 or by mail to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717.

For purposes of the Plan, a Holder's employee-employer relationship or consultancy relations shall be deemed to be terminated in the event that the Subsidiary employing or contracting with such Holder ceases to remain a Subsidiary following any merger, sale of stock or other corporate transaction or event (including, without limitation, a spin-off).
ARTICLE 3.
SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
3.1    Number of Shares.
(a)    Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.1(b) and Section 14.2, the aggregate number of Shares which may be issued or transferred pursuant to Awards granted after September 30, 2014 under the Plan is 7,000,819.  From and after the effective date of the 2011 Plan, no future awards shall be granted under the Prior Plan; however, any Prior Plan Award shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the Prior Plan.
(b)    To the extent all or a portion of an Award or a Prior Plan Award is forfeited, expires or lapses for any reason, or is settled for cash without the delivery of Shares to the Holder, any Shares subject to such Award, Prior Plan Award or portion thereof, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration, lapse or cash settlement, shall again be or shall become, as applicable, available for the future grant of an Award pursuant to the Plan.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the following Shares shall not be added to the Shares authorized for grant under Section 3.1(a) and shall not be available 
A-6
Table of Contents for future grants of Awards: (i) Shares tendered by a Holder or withheld by the Company in payment of the exercise price of an Option; (ii) Shares tendered by the Holder or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right; (iii) Shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the Stock Appreciation Right on exercise thereof; and (iv) Shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of Options. Any Shares repurchased by or surrendered to the Company pursuant to Section 8.4 at the same price paid by the Holder or in connection with a Prior Plan Award so that such Shares are returned to the Company shall again be or shall become, as applicable, available for the future grant of an Award pursuant to the Plan.  The payment of Dividend Equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding Awards shall not be counted against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.1(b), no Shares may again be or, as applicable, may become eligible to be, optioned, granted or awarded if such action would cause an Incentive Stock Option to fail to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code.
(c)    To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan.  Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan; provided that Awards using such available Shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not employed by or providing services to the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition or combination.
3.2    Stock Distributed.  Any Shares distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Common Stock, treasury Common Stock or Common Stock purchased on the open market.
3.3    Limitation on Number of Shares Subject to Awards.  Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, and subject to Section 14.2, the maximum aggregate number of Shares with respect to one or more Awards denominated in Shares that may be granted to any one person during any fiscal year of the Company shall be 750,000 and the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid in cash to any one person during any fiscal year of the Company with respect to one or more Awards payable in cash and not denominated in Shares shall be $7,500,000.
ARTICLE 4.
GRANTING OF AWARDS
4.1    Participation.  The Administrator may, from time to time, select from among all Eligible Individuals, those to whom an Award shall be granted and shall determine the nature and amount of each Award, which shall not be inconsistent with the requirements of the Plan.  No Eligible Individual shall have any right to be granted an Award pursuant to the Plan.
4.2    Award Agreement.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for such Award, which may include the term of the Award, the provisions applicable in the event of the Holder's Termination of Service, and the Company's authority to unilaterally or bilaterally amend, modify, suspend, cancel or rescind an Award.  Award Agreements evidencing Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code.  Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code.
4.3    Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan, and any Award granted or awarded to any individual who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule 16b‑3 of the Exchange Act and any amendments thereto) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.
4.4    At-Will Employment; Voluntary Participation.  Nothing in the Plan or in any Program or Award Agreement shall confer upon any Holder any right to continue in the employ of, or as a Director or Consultant for, the Company or any Subsidiary, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and any Subsidiary, which rights are 
A-7
Table of Contents hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Holder at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, and with or without notice, or to terminate or change all other terms and conditions of employment or engagement, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Holder and the Company or any Subsidiary.  Participation by each Holder in the Plan shall be voluntary and nothing in the Plan shall be construed as mandating that any Eligible Individual shall participate in the Plan.
4.5    Stand-Alone and Tandem Awards.  Awards granted pursuant to the Plan may, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, any other Award granted pursuant to the Plan.

4.6    Non-Employee Director Award Limit.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, the maximum aggregate grant date fair value of Awards granted to a Non-Employee Director as compensation for services as a Non-Employee Director during any fiscal year of the Company shall be $500,000 (the "Director Limit").
ARTICLE 5.
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS INTENDED TO QUALIFY AS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION
5.1    Purpose.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine at the time an Award is granted or at any time thereafter whether such Award is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation. If the Committee, in its sole discretion, decides to grant such an Award to an Eligible Individual that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation (other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right), then the provisions of this Article 5 shall control over any contrary provision contained in the Plan.  The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may grant Awards to other Eligible Individuals that are based on Performance Criteria or Performance Goals or any such other criteria and goals as the Administrator shall establish, but that do not satisfy the requirements of this Article 5 and that are not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation.  Unless otherwise specified by the Committee at the time of grant, the Performance Criteria with respect to an Award intended to be Performance-Based Compensation payable to a Covered Employee shall be determined on the basis of Applicable Accounting Standards.
5.2    Applicability.  The grant of an Award to an Eligible Individual for a particular Performance Period shall not require the grant of an Award to such Eligible Individual in any subsequent Performance Period and the grant of an Award to any one Eligible Individual shall not require the grant of an Award to any other Eligible Individual in such period or in any other period.
5.3    Types of Awards.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may grant any Award to an Eligible Individual intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, including, without limitation, Restricted Stock the restrictions with respect to which lapse upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals, Restricted Stock Units that vest and become payable upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals and any Performance Awards described in Article 10 that vest or become exercisable or payable upon the attainment of one or more specified Performance Goals.
5.4    Procedures with Respect to Performance-Based Awards.  To the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, with respect to any Award granted to one or more Eligible Individuals which is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, no later than 90 days following the commencement of any Performance Period or any designated fiscal period or period of service (or such earlier time as may be required under Section 162(m) of the Code), the Committee shall, in writing, (a) designate one or more Eligible Individuals, (b) select the Performance Criteria applicable to the Performance Period, (c) establish the Performance Goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period based on the Performance Criteria, and (d) specify the relationship between Performance Criteria and the Performance Goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Covered Employee for such Performance Period. Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing whether and the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period. In determining the amount earned under such Awards, the Committee shall have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant, including the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period.
5.5    Additional Limitations.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan and except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, any Award which is granted to an Eligible Individual and is intended to qualify as Performance-Based 
A-8
Table of Contents
Compensation shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as Performance-Based Compensation, and the Plan and the applicable Program and Award Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.
ARTICLE 6.
GRANTING OF OPTIONS
6.1    Granting of Options to Eligible Individuals.  The Administrator is authorized to grant Options to Eligible Individuals from time to time, in its sole discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine which shall not be inconsistent with the Plan.
6.2    Option Exercise Price.  The exercise price per Share subject to each Option shall be set by the Administrator, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or, as to Incentive Stock Options, on the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code), unless determined otherwise by the Administrator.  In addition, in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder, such price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code).
6.3    Option Vesting.
(a)    The period during which the right to exercise, in whole or in part, an Option vests in the Holder shall be set by the Administrator and the Administrator may determine that an Option may not be exercised in whole or in part for a specified period after it is granted.  Such vesting may be based on service with the Company or any Subsidiary or any other criteria, including Performance Goals or Performance Criteria, selected by the Administrator.  At any time after grant of an Option, except as limited by the Plan, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, and subject to whatever terms and conditions it selects, accelerate the period during which an Option vests.
(b)    No portion of an Option which is unexercisable at a Holder's Termination of Service shall thereafter become exercisable, except as may be otherwise provided by the Administrator in the applicable Program, Award Agreement, or by action of the Administrator before or after the grant of the Option, including action taken prior to the Effective Date.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in the Award Agreement or by action of the Administrator following the grant of the Option, the portion of an Option which is unexercisable at a Holder's Termination of Service shall automatically expire thirty (30) days following such Termination of Service.
6.4    Substitute Awards.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 6 to the contrary, in the case of an Option that is a Substitute Award, the price per share of the Shares subject to such Option may be less than the Fair Market Value per share on the date of grant; provided that the excess of: (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date such Substitute Award is granted) of the Shares subject to the Substitute Award, over (b) the aggregate exercise price thereof does not exceed the excess of: (x) the aggregate fair market value (as of the time immediately preceding the transaction giving rise to the Substitute Award, such fair market value to be determined by the Administrator) of the shares of the predecessor entity that were subject to the grant assumed or substituted for by the Company, over (y) the aggregate exercise price of such shares.
ARTICLE 7.
EXERCISE OF OPTIONS
7.1    Manner of Exercise.  All or a portion of an exercisable Option shall be deemed exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the Secretary of the Company or such other person or entity designated by the Administrator, or his, her or its office, as applicable:
(a)    A written or electronic notice complying with the applicable rules established by the Administrator stating that the Option, or a portion thereof, is exercised.  The notice shall be signed by the Holder or other person then entitled to exercise the Option or such portion of the Option;
(b)    Such representations and documents as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with Applicable Law.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, also take whatever 
A-9
Table of Contents additional actions it deems appropriate to effect such compliance including, without limitation, placing legends on share certificates and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars;
(c)    In the event that the Option shall be exercised by any person or persons other than the Holder, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option, as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator; and
(d)    Full payment of the exercise price and applicable withholding taxes to the stock administrator of the Company for the shares with respect to which the Option, or portion thereof, is exercised, in a manner permitted by Sections 12.1 and 12.2.
7.2    Partial Exercise.  An exercisable Option may be exercised in whole or in part.  However, an Option shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional shares unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, and the Administrator may require that, by the terms of the Option, a partial exercise must be with respect to a minimum number of shares.
7.3    Option Term.  The term of each Option (the "Option Term") shall be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Option Term shall not be more than ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted, or five (5) years from the date an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder.  The Administrator shall determine the time period, including the time period following a Termination of Service, during which the Holder has the right to exercise the vested Options, which time period may not extend beyond the last day of the Option Term.
7.4    Expiration of Option Term:  Automatic Exercise of In-The-Money Options.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator (in an Award Agreement or otherwise) or as otherwise directed by an Option Holder in writing to the Company, each vested and exercisable Option outstanding on the Automatic Exercise Date with an exercise price per share that is less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of such date shall automatically and without further action by the Option Holder or the Company be exercised on the Automatic Exercise Date.  In the discretion of the Administrator, payment of the exercise price of any such Option shall be made pursuant to Section 12.1(b) or 12.1(c) and the Company or any Subsidiary shall deduct or withhold an amount sufficient to satisfy all taxes associated with such exercise in accordance with Section 12.2.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, this Section 7.4 shall not apply to an Option if the Holder of such Option experiences a Termination of Service on or before the Automatic Exercise Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Option with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Automatic Exercise Date shall be exercised pursuant to this Section 7.4.
7.5    Qualification of Incentive Stock Options.  No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any person who is not an Employee of the Company or any subsidiary corporation (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) of the Company.  No person who qualifies as a Greater Than 10% Stockholder may be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless such Incentive Stock Option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code.  Any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan may be modified by the Administrator, with the consent of the Holder, to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code.  To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of stock with respect to which "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to Section 422(d) of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by a Holder during any calendar year under the Plan, and all other plans of the Company and any subsidiary or parent corporation thereof (each as defined in Section 424(f) and (e) of the Code, respectively), exceeds $100,000, the Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code.  The rule set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options and other "incentive stock options" into account in the order in which they were granted and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the respective options were granted.
7.6    Notification Regarding Disposition.  The Holder shall give the Company prompt written or electronic notice of any disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option which occurs within (a) two years from the date of granting (including the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code) such Option to such Holder, or (b) one year after the transfer of such shares to such Holder.

ARTICLE 8.
AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK
8.1    Award of Restricted Stock.
(a)    The Administrator is authorized to grant Restricted Stock to Eligible Individuals, and shall determine the terms and conditions, including the restrictions applicable to each award of Restricted Stock, which terms and conditions shall not be inconsistent with the Plan, and may impose such conditions on the issuance of such Restricted Stock as it deems appropriate.
(b)    The Administrator shall establish the purchase price, if any, and form of payment for Restricted Stock; provided, however, that if a purchase price is charged, such purchase price shall be no less than the par value, if any, of the Shares to be purchased, unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Law.  In all cases, legal consideration shall be required for each issuance of Restricted Stock.
8.2    Rights as Stockholders.  Subject to Section 8.4, upon issuance of Restricted Stock, the Holder shall have, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, all the rights of a stockholder with respect to said shares, subject to the restrictions in the applicable Program or each individual Award Agreement, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect to the shares; provided, however, that, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, any extraordinary distributions with respect to the Shares shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 8.3.  In addition, with respect to a share of Restricted Stock with performance-based vesting, dividends which are paid prior to vesting shall only be paid out to the Holder to the extent that the performance-based vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the share of Restricted Stock vests.
8.3    Restrictions.  All shares of Restricted Stock (including any shares received by Holders thereof with respect to shares of Restricted Stock as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization) shall, in the terms of the applicable Program or each individual Award Agreement, be subject to such restrictions and vesting requirements as the Administrator shall provide.  Such restrictions may include, without limitation, restrictions concerning voting rights and transferability and such restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times and pursuant to such circumstances or based on such criteria as selected by the Administrator, including, without limitation, criteria based on the Holder's duration of employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, Performance Goals or Performance Criteria selected by the Administrator, Company performance, individual performance or other criteria selected by the Administrator.  By action taken after the Restricted Stock is issued, the Administrator may, on such terms and conditions as it may determine to be appropriate, accelerate the vesting of such Restricted Stock by removing any or all of the restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable Program or Award Agreement.  Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, Restricted Stock may not be sold or encumbered until all restrictions are terminated or expire. 
8.4    Repurchase or Forfeiture of Restricted Stock.  Except as otherwise determined by the Administrator at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, (i) if no price was paid by the Holder for the Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service during the applicable restriction period, the Holder's rights in unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions shall lapse, and such Restricted Stock shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled without consideration, and (ii) if a price was paid by the Holder for the Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service during the applicable restriction period, the Company shall have the right to repurchase from the Holder the unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions at a cash price per share equal to the price paid by the Holder for such Restricted Stock or such other amount as may be specified in the applicable Program or Award Agreement.
8.5    Certificates for Restricted Stock.  Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Administrator shall determine.  Certificates or book entries evidencing shares of Restricted Stock must include an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, (a) retain physical possession of any stock certificate evidencing shares of Restricted Stock until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and/or (b) require that the stock certificates evidencing shares of Restricted Stock be held in custody by a designated escrow agent (which may but need not be the Company) until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and that the Holder deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to such Restricted Stock.
8.6    Section 83(b) Election.  If a Holder makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the Restricted Stock as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Holder would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code, the Holder shall be required to deliver a copy of such election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service.

10.1    Performance Awards.  
(a)    The Administrator is authorized to grant Performance Awards, including Awards of Performance Stock Units and other Awards determined in the Administrator's discretion from time to time, to any Eligible Individual and to determine whether such Performance Awards shall be Performance-Based Compensation.

Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional shares of Common Stock by such formula and at such time and subject to such restrictions and limitations as may be determined by the Administrator.  In addition, Dividend Equivalents with respect to an Award with performance-based vesting that are based on dividends paid prior to the vesting of such Award shall only be paid out to the Holder to the extent that the performance-based vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the Award vests.
10.3    Stock Payments.  The Administrator is authorized to make Stock Payments to any Eligible Individual.  The number or value of shares of any Stock Payment shall be determined by the Administrator and may be based upon one or more Performance Criteria or any other specific criteria, including service to the Company or any Subsidiary, determined by the Administrator.  Shares underlying a Stock Payment which is subject to a vesting schedule or other conditions or criteria set by the Administrator will not be issued until those conditions have been satisfied.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, a Holder of a Stock Payment shall have no rights as a Company stockholder with respect to such Stock Payment until such time as the Stock Payment has vested and the Shares underlying the Award have been issued to the Holder.  Stock Payments may, but are not required to, be made in lieu of base salary, bonus, fees or other cash compensation otherwise payable to such Eligible Individual.
10.4    Purchase Price.  The Administrator may establish the purchase price of a Performance Award or shares distributed as a Stock Payment award; provided, however, that value of the consideration shall not be less than the par value of a Share, unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Law.

AWARD OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
11.1    Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights.
(a)    The Administrator is authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals from time to time, in its sole discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine consistent with the Plan.
(b)    A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Holder (or other person entitled to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right pursuant to the Plan) to exercise all or a specified portion of the Stock Appreciation Right (to the extent then exercisable pursuant to its terms) and to receive from the Company an amount determined by multiplying the difference obtained by subtracting the exercise price per share of the Stock Appreciation Right from the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right by the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised, subject to any limitations the Administrator may impose.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, and except as described in (c) below, the exercise price per Share subject to each Stock Appreciation Right shall be set by the Administrator, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted.
(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 11.1(b) to the contrary, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right that is a Substitute Award, the exercise price per share of the Shares subject to such Stock Appreciation Right may be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per share on the date of grant; provided that the excess of: (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date such Substitute Award is granted) of the Shares subject to the Substitute Award, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price thereof does not exceed the excess of: (x) the aggregate fair market value (as of the time immediately preceding the transaction giving rise to the Substitute Award, such fair market value to be determined by the Administrator) of the shares of the predecessor entity that were subject to the grant assumed or substituted for by the Company, over (y) the aggregate exercise price of such shares.
11.2    Stock Appreciation Right Vesting.
(a)    The period during which the right to exercise, in whole or in part, a Stock Appreciation Right vests in the Holder shall be set by the Administrator and the Administrator may determine that a Stock Appreciation Right may not be exercised in whole or in part for a specified period after it is granted.  Such vesting may be based on service with the Company or any Subsidiary, any of the Performance Criteria, or any other criteria selected by the Administrator.  Except as limited by the Plan, at any time after grant of a Stock Appreciation Right, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion and subject to whatever terms and conditions it selects, accelerate the period during which a Stock Appreciation Right vests.

Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in the Award Agreement or by action of the Administrator following the grant of the Stock Appreciation Right, the portion of a Stock Appreciation Right which is unexercisable at a Holder's Termination of Service shall automatically expire thirty (30) days following such Termination of Service.
11.3    Manner of Exercise.  All or a portion of an exercisable Stock Appreciation Right shall be deemed exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the stock administrator of the Company, or such other person or entity designated by the Administrator, or his, her or its office, as applicable:
(a)    A written or electronic notice complying with the applicable rules established by the Administrator stating that the Stock Appreciation Right, or a portion thereof, is exercised.  The notice shall be signed by the Holder or other person then entitled to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right or such portion of the Stock Appreciation Right;
(b)    Such representations and documents as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with Applicable Law.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, also take whatever additional actions it deems appropriate to effect such compliance;
(c)    In the event that the Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercised by any person or persons other than the Holder, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right; and
(d)    Full payment of the exercise price (if any) and applicable withholding taxes to the stock plan administrator of the Company for the Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right, or portion thereof, is exercised, in a manner permitted by Sections 12.1 and 12.2.
11.4    Stock Appreciation Right Term.  The term of each Stock Appreciation Right (the "Stock Appreciation Right Term") shall be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the term shall not be more than ten (10) years from the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted.  The Administrator shall determine the time period, including the time period following a Termination of Service, during which the Holder has the right to exercise a vested Stock Appreciation Right, which time period may not extend beyond the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right Term applicable to such Stock Appreciation Right.  Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and regulations and rulings thereunder or the first sentence of this Section 11.4, the Administrator may extend the Stock Appreciation Right Term of any outstanding Stock Appreciation Right, and may extend the time period during which vested Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised, in connection with any Termination of Service of the Holder, and may amend, subject to Section 14.1, any other term or condition of such Stock Appreciation Right relating to such a Termination of Service.
11.5    Payment.  Payment of the amounts payable with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Article 11 shall be in cash, Shares (based on its Fair Market Value as of the date the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised), or a combination of both, as determined by the Administrator.
11.6    Expiration of Stock Appreciation Right Term:  Automatic Exercise of In-The-Money Stock Appreciation Rights.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator (in an Award Agreement or otherwise) or as otherwise directed by a Stock Appreciation Right Holder in writing to the Company, each vested and exercisable Stock Appreciation Right outstanding on the Automatic Exercise Date with an exercise price per share that is less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as of such date shall automatically and without further action by the Stock Appreciation Right Holder or the Company be exercised on the Automatic Exercise Date.  In the discretion of the Administrator, the Company or any Subsidiary shall deduct or withhold an amount sufficient to satisfy all taxes associated with such exercise in accordance with Section 12.2.  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, this Section 11.6 shall not apply to a Stock Appreciation Right if the Holder of such Stock Appreciation Right experiences a Termination of Service on or before the Automatic Exercise Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Automatic Exercise Date shall be exercised pursuant to this Section 11.6.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AWARDS
12.1    Payment.  The Administrator shall determine the methods by which payments by any Holder with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan shall be made, including, without limitation: (a) cash or check, (b) Shares (including, in the case of payment of the exercise price of an Award, Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Award) or Shares held for such period of time as may be required by the Administrator in order to avoid adverse accounting consequences, in each case, having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate payments required, (c) delivery of a written or electronic notice that the Holder has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise or vesting of an Award, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the aggregate payments required; provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company upon settlement of such sale, or (d) any other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Administrator.  The Administrator shall also determine the methods by which Shares shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Holders.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Holder who is a Director or an "executive officer" of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan, or continue any extension of credit with respect to such payment, with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.
12.2    Tax Withholding.  The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Holder to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local and foreign taxes (including the Holder's FICA, employment tax or other social security contribution obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event concerning a Holder arising as a result of the Plan.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement, withhold, or allow a Holder to elect to have the Company withhold, Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the surrender of Shares).  Except as determined otherwise by the Administrator, the number of Shares which may be so withheld or surrendered shall be limited to the number of shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income. The Administrator shall determine the fair market value of the Shares, consistent with applicable provisions of the Code, for tax withholding obligations due in connection with a broker-assisted cashless Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise involving the sale of shares to pay the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise price or any tax withholding obligation.
12.3    Transferability of Awards.
(a)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.3(b) and 12.3(c):
(i)    No Award under the Plan may be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the Administrator, pursuant to a DRO, unless and until such Award has been exercised, or the shares underlying such Award have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed;
(ii)    No Award or interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Holder or his successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by Section 12.3(a)(i); and
(iii)    During the lifetime of the Holder, only the Holder may exercise an Award (or any portion thereof) granted to him under the Plan, unless it has been disposed of pursuant to a DRO; after the death of the Holder, any exercisable portion of an Award may, prior to the time when such portion becomes unexercisable under the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement, be exercised by the Holder's personal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased Holder's will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution.
(b)    Notwithstanding Section 12.3(a), the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine to permit a Holder to transfer an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option to any one or more Permitted Transferees, subject to the following terms and conditions:  (i) an Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee without the consent of the Administrator 
A-15
Table of Contents shall not be assignable or transferable by the Permitted Transferee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a DRO; (ii) an Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall continue to be subject to all the terms and conditions of the Award as applicable to the original Holder (other than the ability to further transfer the Award); and (iii) the Holder and the Permitted Transferee shall execute any and all documents requested by the Administrator, including, without limitation documents to (A) confirm the status of the transferee as a Permitted Transferee, (B) satisfy any requirements for an exemption for the transfer under Applicable Law and (C) evidence the transfer.
(c)    Notwithstanding Section 12.3(a), a Holder may, in the manner determined by the Administrator, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Holder and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Holder's death.  A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Program or Award Agreement applicable to the Holder, except to the extent the Plan, the Program and Award Agreement otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Administrator.  If the Holder is married or a domestic partner in a domestic partnership qualified under Applicable Law and resides in a community property state, a designation of a person other than the Holder's spouse or domestic partner, as applicable, as his or her beneficiary with respect to more than 50% of the Holder's interest in the Award shall not be effective without the prior written or electronic consent of the Holder's spouse or domestic partner.  If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Holder, payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to the Holder's will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Holder at any time; provided that the change or revocation is filed with the Administrator prior to the Holder's death.
12.4    Conditions to Issuance of Shares.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates or make any book entries evidencing Shares  issuable pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof, unless and until the Board or the Committee has determined, with advice of counsel, that the issuance of such shares is in compliance with Applicable Law and the Shares are covered by an effective registration statement or applicable exemption from registration.  In addition to the terms and conditions provided herein, the Board or the Committee may require that a Holder make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as the Board or the Committee, in its discretion, deems advisable in order to comply with Applicable Law.
(b)    All Share certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan and all shares issued pursuant to book entry procedures are subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to comply with Applicable Law.  The Administrator may place legends on any Share certificate or book entry to reference restrictions applicable to the Shares.
(c)    The Administrator shall have the right to require any Holder to comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement, distribution or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the sole discretion of the Administrator.
(d)    No fractional Shares shall be issued and the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated by rounding down.
(e)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not deliver to any Holder certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with any Award and instead such Shares shall be recorded in the books of the Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator).
12.5    Forfeiture and Claw-Back Provisions.  Pursuant to its general authority to determine the terms and conditions applicable to Awards under the Plan, the Administrator shall have the right to provide, in an Award Agreement or otherwise, or to require a Holder to agree by separate written or electronic instrument, that:  
(a)    (i) Any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by the Holder upon any receipt or exercise of the Award, or upon the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award, must be paid to the Company, and (ii) the Award shall terminate and any unexercised portion of the Award (whether or not vested) shall be forfeited, if (x) a Termination of Service occurs prior to a specified date, or within a specified time period following receipt or exercise of the Award, or (y) the Holder at any time, or during a specified time period, engages in any activity in competition with the Company, or which is inimical, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company, as further defined by the

Administrator or (z) the Holder incurs a Termination of Service for "cause" (as such term is defined in the sole discretion of the Administrator, or as set forth in a written agreement relating to such Award between the Company and the Holder); and
(b)    All Awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by the Holder upon any receipt or exercise of any Award or upon the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award) shall be subject to the provisions of any claw-back policy implemented by the Company, including, without limitation, any claw-back policy adopted to comply with the requirements of Applicable Law, including without limitation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, to the extent set forth in such claw-back policy and/or in the applicable Award Agreement.

ADMINISTRATION
13.1    Administrator.  The Compensation Committee of the Board (or another committee or a subcommittee of the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board assuming the functions of the Committee under the Plan) shall administer the Plan (except as otherwise permitted herein).  To the extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and with respect to Awards that are intended to be Performance-Based Compensation, including Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Compensation Committee of the Board (or another committee or subcommittee of the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board assuming the functions of the Committee under the Plan) shall take all action with respect to such Awards, and the individuals taking such action shall consist solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors appointed by and holding office at the pleasure of the Board, each of whom is intended to qualify as both a "non-employee director" as defined by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule and an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.  Additionally, to the extent required by Applicable Law, each of the individuals constituting the Compensation Committee of the Board (or another committee or subcommittee of the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board assuming the functions of the Committee under the Plan) shall be an "independent director" under the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action taken by the Committee shall be valid and effective, whether or not members of the Committee at the time of such action are later determined not to have satisfied the requirements for membership set forth in this Section 13.1 or otherwise provided in any charter of the Committee.  Except as may otherwise be provided in any charter of the Committee, appointment of Committee members shall be effective upon acceptance of appointment.  Committee members may resign at any time by delivering written or electronic notice to the Board.  Vacancies in the Committee may only be filled by the Board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the full Board, acting by a majority of its members in office, shall conduct the general administration of the Plan with respect to Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors and, with respect to such Awards, the terms "Administrator" and "Committee" as used in the Plan shall be deemed to refer to the Board and (b) the Board or Committee may delegate its authority hereunder to the extent permitted by Section 13.6.
13.2    Duties and Powers of Committee.  It shall be the duty of the Committee to conduct the general administration of the Plan in accordance with its provisions.  The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan, the Program and the Award Agreement, and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are not inconsistent therewith, to interpret, amend or revoke any such rules and to amend any Program or Award Agreement; provided that the rights or obligations of the Holder of the Award that is the subject of any such Program or Award Agreement are not affected adversely by such amendment, unless the consent of the Holder is obtained or such amendment is otherwise permitted under Section 12.5(b) or Section 14.10.  Any such grant or award under the Plan need not be the same with respect to each Holder.  Any such interpretations and rules with respect to Incentive Stock Options shall be consistent with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code.  In its sole discretion, the Board may at any time and from time to time exercise any and all rights and duties of the Committee under the Plan, except with respect to matters which under Rule 16b‑3 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule, or Section 162(m) of the Code, or any regulations or rules issued thereunder, or the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded, are required to be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.  
13.3    Action by the Committee.  Unless otherwise established by the Board or in any charter of the Committee, a majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, and acts approved in writing by all members of the Committee in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Committee.  Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company's independent certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan.

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Board or Committee may from time to time delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board or one or more officers of the Company the authority to grant or amend Awards or to take other administrative actions pursuant to this Article 13; provided, however, that in no event shall an officer of the Company be delegated the authority to grant awards to, or amend awards held by, the following individuals:  (a) individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, (b) Covered Employees or (c) officers of the Company (or Directors) to whom authority to grant or amend Awards has been delegated hereunder; provided, further, that any delegation of administrative authority shall only be permitted to the extent it is permissible under Section 162(m) of the Code and other Applicable Law.  Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Board or Committee specifies at the time of such delegation, and the Board may at any time rescind the authority so delegated or appoint a new delegatee.  At all times, the delegatee appointed under this Section 13.6 shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Board and the Committee.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
14.1    Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 14.1, the Plan may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Board or the Committee.  However, without approval of the Company's stockholders given within twelve (12) months before or after the action by the Administrator, no action of the Administrator may, except as provided in Section 14.2, increase the limit imposed in Section 3.1 on the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the Plan or amend or modify the Plan in a manner requiring stockholder approval under Applicable Law.  Except as provided in Sections 12.5 and 14.10, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall, without the consent of the Holder, materially impair any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted or awarded, unless the Award itself otherwise expressly so provides.  No Awards may be granted or awarded during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan, and in no event may any Award be granted under the Plan after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Expiration Date").  Any Awards that are outstanding on the Expiration Date shall remain in force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.
14.2    Changes in Common Stock or Assets of the Company, Acquisition or Liquidation of the Company and Other Corporate Events.
(a)    In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting the shares of the Company's stock or the share price of the Company's stock other than an Equity Restructuring, the Administrator shall make equitable adjustments, if any, to reflect such change with respect to: (i) the aggregate number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitation in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 on the maximum number and kind of shares which may be issued under the Plan, and adjustments of the Award Limit); (ii) the number and kind of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the terms and conditions of any outstanding Awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect thereto); and (iv) the grant or exercise price per share for any outstanding Awards under the Plan.  Any adjustment affecting an Award intended as Performance-Based Compensation shall be made consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(b)    In the event of any transaction or event described in Section 14.2(a) or any unusual or nonrecurring transactions or events affecting the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or of changes in Applicable Law or accounting principles, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by action taken prior to the occurrence of such transaction or event and either automatically or upon the Holder's request, is hereby authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator determines that such action is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to any Award under the Plan, to facilitate such transactions or events or to give effect to such changes in laws, regulations or principles:
(i)    To provide for either (A) termination of any such Award in exchange for an amount of cash, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holder's rights (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction or event described in this Section 14.2 the Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holder's rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment) or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion having an aggregate value not exceeding the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holder's rights had such Award been currently exercisable or payable or fully vested;
A-19
Table of Contents
(ii)    To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices;
(iii)    To make adjustments in the number and type of shares of the Company's stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and in the number and kind of outstanding Restricted Stock and/or in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the criteria included in, outstanding Awards and Awards which may be granted in the future; 
(iv)    To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or fully vested with respect to all shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement; and
(v)    To provide that the Award cannot vest, be exercised or become payable after such event.
(c)    In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 14.2(a) or 14.2(b), the Administrator shall  equitably adjust each outstanding Award, which adjustments may include adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and/or the exercise price or grant price thereof, if applicable, the grant of new Awards to participants, and/or the making of a cash payment to participants, as the Administrator deems appropriate to reflect such Equity Restructuring.  The adjustments provided under this Section 14.2(c) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Holder and the Company; provided that whether an adjustment is equitable shall be determined in the discretion of the Administrator.
(d)    In the event that the successor corporation in a Change in Control refuses to assume or substitute for an Award upon the Change in Control, such Award shall become fully vested and, if applicable, exercisable and all forfeiture restrictions on such Award shall lapse as of immediately prior to the consummation of such Change in Control.  If an Award is exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Holder that the Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, contingent upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, and the Award shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.
(e)    The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, include such further provisions and limitations in any Award, agreement or certificate, as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.
(f)    With respect to Awards which are granted to Covered Employees and are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, no adjustment or action described in this Section 14.2 or in any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment or action would cause such Award to fail to so qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, unless the Administrator determines that the Award should not so qualify.  No adjustment or action described in this Section 14.2 or in any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment or action would cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code.  Furthermore, no such adjustment or action shall be authorized to the extent such adjustment or action would result in short-swing profits liability under Section 16 or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule 16b-3 unless the Administrator determines that the Award is not to comply with such exemptive conditions. 
(g)    The existence of the Plan, the Program, the Award Agreement and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.
(h)    No action shall be taken under this Section 14.2 which shall cause an Award to fail to comply with Section 409A of the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder, to the extent applicable to such Award.
(i)    In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other 
A-20
Table of Contents extraordinary transaction or change affecting the shares of Common Stock or the share price of the Common Stock including any Equity Restructuring, for reasons of administrative convenience, the Company, in its sole discretion, may refuse to permit the exercise of any Award during a period of up to thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of any such transaction.
14.3    Approval of Plan by Stockholders.  The Plan will be submitted for the approval of the Company's stockholders within twelve (12) months after the date of the Board's initial adoption of the Plan.  If the Plan is not approved by the Company's stockholders, (i) it will not become effective, (ii) no Awards shall be granted thereunder, and (iii) the 2011 Plan will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.  Upon the approval of the Plan by the Company's stockholders, any awards outstanding under the 2011 Plan as of the date of such approval shall remain outstanding and, if applicable, exercisable pursuant to the terms of such individual grants.
14.4    No Stockholders Rights.  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Holder shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by any Award until the Holder becomes the record owner of such shares of Common Stock.
14.5    Paperless Administration.  In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Holder may be permitted through the use of such an automated system.
14.6    Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans.  The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary.  Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary:  (a) to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for Employees, Directors or Consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) except as otherwise provided in the final sentence of Section 3.1(a), to grant or assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection with any proper corporate purpose including without limitation, the grant or assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm or association.
14.7    Compliance with Laws.  The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all Applicable Law (including but not limited to margin requirements), and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith.  Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all Applicable Law.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to Applicable Law.
14.8    Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or Exchange Act.  The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control. References to sections of the Code or the Exchange Act shall include any amendment or successor thereto.
14.9    Governing Law.  The Plan and any agreements hereunder shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws thereof or of any other jurisdiction.
14.10    Section 409A.  To the extent that the Administrator determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Program pursuant to which such Award is granted and the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent applicable, the Plan, the Program and Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance (including such Department of Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the Administrator may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Program and Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the

Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.  
14.11    No Rights to Awards.  No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan, and neither the Company nor the Administrator is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals, Holders or any other persons uniformly.
14.12    Unfunded Status of Awards.  The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation.  With respect to any payments not yet made to a Holder pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.
14.13    Indemnification.  To the extent allowable pursuant to Applicable Law, each member of the Committee or of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf.  The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
14.14    Relationship to other Benefits.  No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.
14.15    Expenses.  The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
