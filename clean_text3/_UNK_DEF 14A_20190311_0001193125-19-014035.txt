SHAREHOLDERS, WE NEED YOUR PROXY VOTE IMMEDIATELY. 
YOUR VOTE IS VITAL. THE JOINT MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE TO BE ADJOURNED WITHOUT CONDUCTING ANY BUSINESS IF FEWER THAN A MAJORITY OF THE SHARES ELIGIBLE TO VOTE ARE REPRESENTED. IN THAT EVENT, ONE OR MORE OF THE FUNDS WOULD ADJOURN THE MEETING AND CONTINUE TO SOLICIT VOTES IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A QUORUM. TO AVOID THE EXPENSE OF AND THE POSSIBLE DELAY CREATED BY SUCH A SOLICITATION, PLEASE VOTE YOUR PROXY IMMEDIATELY. YOU AND ALL OTHER SHAREHOLDERS WILL BENEFIT FROM YOUR COOPERATION. 
JOINT PROXY STATEMENT 
The board of directors (the "Board") of each of DNP Select Income Fund Inc. ("DNP"), Duff & Phelps Global Utility Income Fund Inc. ("DPG"), Duff & Phelps Utility and Corporate Bond Trust Inc. ("DUC") and DTF Tax-Free Income Inc. ("DTF" and, collectively with DNP, DPG and DUC, the "Funds") is soliciting proxies from the shareholders of each Fund for use at the joint annual meeting of shareholders to be held on Monday, March 11, 2019 and at any adjournment or postponement of that meeting. A proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted, either by voting in person at the meeting or by written notice to the applicable Fund or delivery of a later-dated proxy. 
The meeting is scheduled as a joint meeting of the respective shareholders of the Funds because the shareholders of each Fund are expected to consider and vote on similar matters. The Board has determined that the use of a joint proxy statement for the meeting is in the best interest of the shareholders of each Fund. In the event that any shareholder of a Fund present at the meeting objects to the holding of a joint meeting and moves for an adjournment of such Fund's meeting to a time immediately after the meeting, so that such Fund's meeting may be held separately, the persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment. Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on each of the proposals relating to their respective Fund, and an unfavorable vote on a proposal by the shareholders of one Fund will not affect the implementation by the other Fund of such proposal if the shareholders of such other Fund approve the proposal.

Board Leadership Structure 
The Board believes that the most appropriate leadership structure for the Funds is for the Chairman of the Board to be an independent director, in order to provide strong, independent oversight of each Fund's management and affairs, including each Fund's risk management function. Accordingly, while the Chief Executive Officer of the Funds will generally be a member of the Board, he or she will not normally be eligible to serve as Chairman of the Board. The independent Chairman of the Board presides at meetings of the shareholders, meetings of the Board and meetings of independent directors. In addition, the independent Chairman of the Board takes part in the meetings and deliberations of all committees of the Board, facilitates communication among directors and communication between the Board and the Funds' management and is available for consultation with the Funds' management between Board meetings. The Board has four standing committees, which are described below: the executive committee, the audit committee, the contracts committee, and the nominating and governance committee. 
The executive committee of the Board is currently comprised of Mr. Vitale (Chairman), Mr. Burke, Ms. McNamara and Ms. Moran, and has authority, with certain exceptions, to exercise the powers of the Board between Board meetings. 
The audit committee of the Board is currently comprised of all independent directors of the Funds (Mr. Burke, Chairman) and makes recommendations regarding the selection of each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and meets with representatives of that accounting firm to determine the scope of and review the results of each audit. 
The contracts committee of the Board is currently comprised of all independent directors of the Funds (Ms. Moran, Chairperson) and makes recommendations regarding each Fund's contractual arrangements for investment management and administrative services, including the terms and conditions of such contracts. 
The nominating and governance committee of the Board is currently comprised of all independent directors of the Funds (Ms. McNamara, Chairperson) and selects nominees for election as directors, recommends individuals to be appointed by the Board as officers of the Funds and members of Board committees and makes recommendations regarding other Fund governance and Board administration matters. 
In addition to the four standing committees, the DNP Board also has a special committee called the ATM committee, which is comprised of the members of the executive committee of the DNP Board (Mr. Vitale (Chairman), Mr. Burke, Ms. McNamara and Ms. Moran) and is responsible for certain oversight functions in connection with DNP's ongoing "at-the-market" ("ATM") offering program.

Risk Oversight. The audit committee charter provides that the audit committee is responsible for discussing with management the guidelines and policies that govern the process by which management assesses and manages each Fund's major financial risk exposures. The contracts committee charter provides that in assessing whether each Fund's investment advisory agreement and administration agreement should be continued, the contracts committee is to give careful consideration to the risk oversight policies of the Adviser and each Fund's administrator, respectively. In addition, the audit committee and the full Board receive periodic reports on enterprise risk management from the chief risk officer of the Adviser. 
Nomination of Directors. The nominating and governance committee acts under a written charter that was most recently amended on December 14, 2016. A copy of the charter is available on each Fund's website at www.dpimc.com/dnp, www.dpimc.com/dpg, www.dpimc.com/duc and www.dpimc.com/dtf and in print to any shareholder who requests it. None of the members of the nominating and governance committee are "interested persons" of the Funds as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. In identifying potential director nominees, the nominating and governance committee considers candidates recommended by one or more of the following sources: the Funds' current directors, the Funds' officers, the Funds' shareholders and any other source the committee deems appropriate. The committee may, but is not required to, retain a third-party search firm at the Funds' expense to identify potential candidates. Shareholders wishing to recommend candidates to the nominating and governance committee should submit such recommendations to the Secretary of the Funds, who will forward the recommendations to the committee for consideration. See also "Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" under "Other Information" below. 
Diversity Policy. The goal of the Funds is to have a board of directors comprising individuals with a diversity of business, educational and life experiences (including, without limitation, with respect to accounting and finance, business and strategic judgment, investment management and financial markets, and knowledge of the industries in which the Funds invest) that will enable them to constructively review, advise and guide management of the Funds. The annual Board self-evaluation process includes consideration of whether the Board's composition represents an appropriate balance of skills and diversity for the Funds' needs. In evaluating potential director nominees, including nominees recommended by shareholders, the nominating and governance committee considers such qualifications and skills as it deems relevant but does not have any specific minimum qualifications that must be met by a nominee. The committee considers, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the extent to which the candidate's business, educational and life experiences will add to the diversity of the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the candidate will qualify as a director who is not an "interested person" of the Funds;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the absence of any real or apparent conflict of interest that would interfere with the candidate's ability to act in the best interests of the  Funds and their shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the contribution that the candidate can make to the Board by virtue of his or her education, business experience and financial expertise;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the interplay of the candidate's skills and experience with the skills and experience of other Board members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the candidate is willing to commit the time necessary to attend meetings and fulfill the responsibilities of a director; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's personality traits, including integrity, independence, leadership, sound business judgment and the ability to work effectively  with the other members of the Board.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to the renomination of incumbent directors, past service to the Board is also considered. 
Retirement Policy. As amended on June 13, 2018, the bylaws of the Funds establish a mandatory retirement age of 78 for directors of the Funds. Specifically, no person who has attained the age of 78 years is eligible for election or reelection as a director, and no incumbent director who attains the age of 78 years is qualified to continue serving as a director following the adjournment of the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders, and therefore his or her service on the Board will automatically terminate at such time. None of the director nominees or incumbent directors are 78 years or older as of the date of this proxy statement or will be 78 years or older as of the scheduled date of the annual meeting. 
Officers of the Funds 
The officers of the Funds are elected at the annual meeting of the Board held in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders. The officers receive no compensation from the Funds, but are also officers of the Adviser or a Fund administrator and receive compensation in such capacities. Information about Nathan I. Partain, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Funds, is provided above under the caption "Nominee—Interested Director." The address for all officers listed below is c/o Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., 200 South Wacker Drive, Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60606, except as noted.

2. CONSIDERATION OF AN AMENDMENT TO DNP'S CHARTER 
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
Description of the Proposed Amendment 
The Board has unanimously approved, and has recommended that the DNP shareholders approve, an amendment to DNP's charter to increase the number of DNP's authorized shares of common stock from 300,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares. 
The Articles of Amendment and Restatement (together with subsequently filed Articles Supplementary and Articles of Amendment) constitute DNP's corporate charter under Maryland law. Article Fourth of the Articles of Amendment and Restatement currently provides that the total number of shares of all classes of stock that DNP has authority to issue is 400,000,000 shares, divided into two classes: 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. If this proposal is approved, DNP will be authorized to issue a total of 450,000,000 shares of stock, consisting of 350,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Amendment 
The proposed amendment to DNP's charter authorizing an additional 50,000,000 shares of common stock will provide DNP with sufficient shares of authorized common stock to continue issuing new shares in connection with DNP's distribution reinvestment and cash purchase plan (the "Reinvestment Plan") and its ongoing ATM offering program. It will also give DNP the flexibility to make future issuances of stock in furtherance of its investment objectives without the necessity of delaying such activities for further shareholder approval (except to the extent that shareholder approvals may be required in particular cases by DNP's charter documents, applicable laws or the rules of any stock exchange on which DNP's securities are listed). 
As more fully described in DNP's most recent annual report to shareholders, pursuant to the Reinvestment Plan, when DNP makes distributions to holders of common stock at a time when the current market price of the common stock equals or exceeds its net asset value, DNP will issue new shares of common stock to participants in the Reinvestment Plan at the greater of current net asset value or 95% of the then current market price. In order for these new issuances under the Reinvestment Plan to be made, there need to be sufficient shares of common stock authorized for issuance under DNP's charter. Similarly, under the ATM offering program, DNP may issue   and sell, from time to time, new shares of common stock with an aggregate value of up to $250 million. As is the case with the Reinvestment Plan, new shares of common stock issued and sold through the ATM offering program need to be authorized for issuance under DNP's charter. As of the date of this proxy statement, DNP has 5,481,359 remaining authorized shares of common stock under the charter, and currently expects to exhaust those remaining shares within approximately seven months. If those shares are exhausted before the charter is amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, DNP will be unable to continue issuing new shares pursuant to the Reinvestment Plan, the ATM offering program or otherwise. 
Potential Risks of the Proposed Amendment 
Any future issuances of additional shares of common stock would have the effect of diluting the voting rights of existing shareholders, and could have the effect of diluting earnings per share and book value per share of existing shareholders. In addition, the availability for issuance of additional shares of common stock could discourage and make more difficult efforts to obtain control of DNP. For example, DNP's authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock could be issued in one or more transactions that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of DNP that might involve a premium price for its shareholders or otherwise be in their best interest. As of the date of this proxy statement, DNP and the Board are not aware of any attempt or plan to obtain control of DNP, and anti-takeover considerations are not part of the Board's rationale for recommending the proposed amendment. Other than in connection with its existing Reinvestment Plan and ATM offering program, DNP has no present intention or plans to issue any additional shares of common stock. 
Board Approval of the Proposed Amendment 
On September 12, 2018, the DNP Board, based on its review and evaluation of the materials it received from the Adviser and DNP's administrator, and after receiving advice from independent legal counsel, unanimously adopted resolutions setting forth the foregoing amendment to DNP's charter, declaring the amendment to be advisable, directing that the amendment be submitted for consideration at the annual meeting of DNP's shareholders and recommending that shareholders vote for the approval of the amendment. The Board took both the potential benefits and the potential risk factors into account when making its determination that increasing the number of authorized shares of DNP's common stock is in the best interests of DNP and its shareholders. 
Vote Required to Approve the Proposed Amendment 
Approval of the proposed DNP charter amendment will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of DNP's outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting, and will also have the effect of a vote "against" the amendment. 
When the Proposed Amendment Would Become Effective 
If approved by DNP's shareholders, the proposed charter amendment would become effective as of the date when Articles of Amendment are filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland or as of such other date as set forth in the Articles of Amendment, not to exceed 30 days after the Articles of Amendment are filed with the Department. It is expected that the Articles of Amendment, if the proposed amendment is approved by the shareholders, would be filed as soon as practicable following the annual   meeting. The exact timing of the filing, however, would be determined by DNP, which reserves the right to delay the filing for up to six months following shareholder approval. In addition, DNP reserves the right, notwithstanding shareholder approval and without further action by the shareholders, to elect not to proceed with the amendment if, at any time prior to the effective time of the Articles of Amendment, the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that the amendment is no longer in the best interests of DNP or its shareholders. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board, including all of the independent directors, unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the foregoing amendment to the DNP charter. 
3. CONSIDERATION OF AN AMENDMENT TO DNP'S CHARTER 
GRANTING AUTHORITY TO THE BOARD TO INCREASE 
OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF ANY CLASS OR SERIES 
Description of the Proposed Amendment 
A majority of the members of the DNP Board, including all of the independent directors, has approved, and has recommended that the DNP shareholders approve, an amendment to the first paragraph of Article Fourth of the Articles of Amendment and Restatement to insert the following sentence between the first and second sentences of the first paragraph: 
"To the extent permitted by Maryland law, the Board of Directors, without any action by the stockholders of the Corporation, may amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Corporation has authority to issue." 
The above provision was not permissible when DNP was incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1986. At that time, the Maryland General Corporation Law required a vote of the corporation's shareholders to approve any amendment to the number of authorized shares specified in a corporation's charter. That is the reason why DNP has needed to seek shareholder approval for a charter amendment from time to time, as the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock becomes depleted (as is now once again the case). 
However, Section 2-105(a)(13) of the Maryland General Corporation Law now permits the charter of a Maryland corporation to include a provision permitting the board of directors, by a majority vote of the entire board, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of any class or series of stock, without the need for shareholder approval. In order to take advantage of that simpler procedure for changing the number of authorized shares of stock, a corporation needs to amend its charter to add a specific provision giving the board that authority, and any such amendment needs to be approved by the shareholders. 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Amendment 
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of DNP and its shareholders to grant the Board the flexibility to increase DNP's authorized shares of capital stock without incurring the additional costs associated with soliciting a shareholder vote at an annual or special meeting. Furthermore, the Board believes that, in the future, occasions may arise where the time required to obtain shareholder approval might adversely delay DNP's ability to enter into a desirable transaction.  If the proposed amendment is approved by the DNP shareholders, DNP would no longer need to seek further shareholder approvals prior to the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, except to the extent that shareholder approvals may be required in particular cases by DNP's charter documents, applicable laws or the rules of any stock exchange on which DNP's securities are listed. The rights and privileges of holders of DNP's common stock would not be changed in any other way by the proposed amendment, and any additional shares of common stock that are authorized in the future would have the same rights and privileges as the shares of common stock currently outstanding. 
Potential Risks of the Proposed Amendment 
Any future issuances of additional shares of common stock would have the effect of diluting the voting rights of existing shareholders, and could have the effect of diluting earnings per share and book value per share of existing shareholders. In addition, the availability for issuance of additional shares of common stock could discourage and make more difficult efforts to obtain control of DNP. For example, DNP's authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock could be issued in one or more transactions that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of DNP that might involve a premium price for its shareholders or otherwise be in their best interest. As of the date of this proxy statement, DNP and the Board are not aware of any attempt or plan to obtain control of DNP, and anti-takeover considerations are not part of the Board's rationale for recommending the proposed amendment. Other than in connection with its existing Reinvestment Plan and ATM offering program, DNP has no present intention or plans to issue any additional shares of common stock. 
Board Approval of the Proposed Amendment

The Board took both the potential benefits and the potential risk factors into account when making its determination that granting the Board the authority to change the number of authorized shares of DNP's stock, or any class or series of DNP's stock, is in the best interests of DNP and its shareholders. 
Vote Required to Approve the Proposed Amendment 
Approval of the proposed DNP charter amendment will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of DNP's outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
A majority of the DNP Board, including all of the independent directors, recommends a vote "FOR" the foregoing amendment to DNP's charter. 
4. CONSIDERATION OF A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT 
TO ONE OF DNP'S FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 
Description of the Proposed Amendment 
Registered investment companies are subject to certain investment restrictions that are considered "fundamental" because they may be changed only with shareholder approval. There are generally eight fundamental investment restrictions that the 1940 Act requires every fund to have: industry concentration, diversification, borrowing money, underwriting securities of other issuers, purchasing or selling real estate or commodities, making loans and the issuance of senior securities. DNP's current fundamental investment restrictions are set forth in the Statement of Additional Information (the "SAI") that forms part of DNP's registration statement. DNP is proposing to make a technical, non-substantive, amendment to change two words in its fundamental investment restriction regarding industry concentration. The amendment will clarify the existing restriction and is not intended to effectuate any substantive change. 
Set forth below is the current fundamental investment restriction on industry concentration, followed by the proposed amended version of that restriction. The affected language has been bolded and underlined for your convenience. 
Current Fundamental Investment Restriction on Industry Concentration 
The Fund may not invest more than 25% of its total assets (valued at the time of investment) in securities of companies engaged principally in any one industry other than the utilities industry, which includes companies engaged in the production, transmission or distribution of electric energy or gas or in telephone services, except that this restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies or instrumentalities. 
Proposed Amended Fundamental Investment Restriction on Industry Concentration 
The Fund shall not invest more than 25% of its total assets (valued at the time of investment) in securities of companies engaged principally in any one industry other than the utilities industry, which includes companies engaged in the production, transmission or distribution of electric energy or gas or in telecommunications services, except that this restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies or instrumentalities.  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Amendment 
The change from "may not" to "shall not" is intended to clarify that DNP is prohibited from investing more than 25% of its total assets in securities of companies engaged principally in any one industry other than the utilities industry. That is how DNP's Board and management have consistently interpreted the wording of this restriction, but the proposed change in wording from "may not" to "shall not" will preclude any possible misinterpretation that DNP has any optionality in that regard. 
The change from "telephone services" to "telecommunications services" is intended to update the language to reflect the evolution of the telecommunications sector since DNP's initial public offering in 1987. 
Potential Risks of the Proposed Amendment 
DNP and the Board are not aware of any potential risks associated with the adoption of the proposed amendment. 
Board Approval of the Proposed Amendment 
On September 12, 2018, the DNP Board, based on its review and evaluation of the materials it received from the Adviser and DNP's independent legal counsel, unanimously adopted resolutions setting forth the foregoing amendment to DNP's fundamental investment restriction on industry concentration, declaring the amendment to be advisable, directing that the amendment be submitted for consideration at the annual meeting of DNP's shareholders and recommending that shareholders vote for the approval of the amendment. 
Vote Required to Approve the Proposed Amendment 
Fundamental investment restrictions can be amended only by the approval of the holders of a "majority" of the outstanding voting securities of a fund. As defined in the 1940 Act, a "majority" of the outstanding voting securities means the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities. In addition, DNP's charter requires any amendments to DNP's fundamental investment restrictions to be approved by a separate class vote of a "majority" of the outstanding preferred stock, using a similar two-pronged definition of "majority" to that set forth in the 1940 Act. 
Accordingly, approval of the proposed amendment to DNP's fundamental investment restrictions will require the affirmative vote of (i) the holders of a "majority" (as defined above) of DNP's outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class, and (ii) the holders of a "majority" of DNP's outstanding preferred stock, voting as a separate class. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting, and will also have the effect of a vote "against" the amendment. 
When the Proposed Amendment Would Become Effective 
If approved by DNP's shareholders, the amended investment restriction will become effective when DNP's SAI is revised or supplemented to reflect the amendment. Assuming the proposed amendment is approved at the upcoming shareholder meeting, DNP expects to file a revision or supplement to the SAI promptly thereafter. If the proposed amendment is not approved by DNP's shareholders, the current investment restriction will remain in effect.  Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board, including all of the independent directors, unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the foregoing amendment to DNP's fundamental investment restrictions. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
Management is not aware of any other matters that will come before the meeting. If any other business should come before the meeting, however, your proxy, if signed and returned, will give discretionary authority to the persons designated in it to vote according to their best judgment.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act imposes the filing requirements of Section 16 of the 1934 Act upon (i) the Funds' directors and officers, (ii) the Funds' investment adviser and certain of their affiliated persons and (iii) every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of a Fund's outstanding securities (other than short-term paper). Based solely on a review of the copies of Section 16(a) forms furnished to the Funds, or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, the Funds believe that during each Fund's most recently completed fiscal year all such filing requirements were complied with, except that one Form 4 filed by Timothy Heaney, the Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of DTF, with respect to a purchase of DTF common stock was filed one day late, due to an inadvertent clerical error by DTF's outside counsel, to whom Mr. Heaney provided timely reporting of his purchase. 
Report of the Audit Committee. The Funds' independent directors comprise the audit committee of each Fund and act under a written charter which sets forth the audit committee's responsibilities. A copy of the audit   committee charter is available on each Fund's website at www.dpimc.com/dnp, www.dpimc.com/dpg, www.dpimc.com/duc and www.dpimc.com/dtf and in print to any shareholder who requests it. Each of the members of the audit committee is independent as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the audit of each Fund's 2018 audited financial statements, the audit committee: (1) reviewed and discussed each Fund's 2018 audited financial statements with management, (2) discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T, (3) received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and (4) discussed with the independent accountant its independence from each Fund and its management. Based on the foregoing reviews and discussions, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that each Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report to Shareholders for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The 1940 Act requires that each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm be selected by the vote, cast in person, of a majority of the members of the Board who are not interested persons of the Fund. In addition, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange vest the audit committee, in its capacity as a committee of the Board, with responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with the foregoing provisions, the firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") has been selected as independent registered public accounting firm of each Fund to perform the audit of the financial books and records of the Funds for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019. A representative of Ernst & Young is expected to be present at the joint annual meeting of shareholders and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a statement if the representative so desires. 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services. Each Fund is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. As part of this responsibility, each Fund's audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent accountant in order to assure that they do not impair the independent accountant's independence from the Fund. Accordingly, each Fund's audit committee has adopted a joint audit and non-audit services pre-approval policy (the "Joint Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy"), which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services proposed to be performed by the independent accountant may be pre-approved. Each engagement of an independent accountant to render audit or non-audit services to a Fund must be either (i) a specific service pre-approved by the Fund's audit committee or the chairman of the audit committee, to whom the committee has delegated the authority to grant such pre-approvals between scheduled meetings of the committee, or (ii) come within the scope of a general pre-approval granted under the Joint Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy. As provided in the Joint Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy, unless a type of   service has received general pre-approval (i.e., the proposed services are pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the audit committee), then the service will require specific pre-approval by the audit committee if the proposed service is to be provided by the independent accountant. As provided in the Joint Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy, any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts require specific pre-approval by the audit committee. In deciding whether to grant pre-approval for such services, the audit committee, or the chairman of the audit committee acting under delegated authority, as the case may be, will consider whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. Additionally, the audit committee, or the chairman of the audit committee acting under delegated authority, as the case may be, will also consider whether the independent accountant is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, after considering a number of factors as a whole, with no one factor being necessarily determinative. 
Each Fund's audit committee is also required to pre-approve its accountant's engagements for non-audit services rendered to the Adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. In deciding whether to grant pre-approval for such non-audit services, the audit committee or the chairman of the audit committee, as the case may be, considers whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the Fund's accountants. 
Audit and Non-Audit Fees. The following table sets forth the aggregate audit and non-audit fees billed to each Fund for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young. For purposes of this table, to the extent the amount of a fee for a pre-approved service is known as of the date of this report, such fee amount has been allocated to the fiscal year to which the applicable service relates, even in cases where the applicable Fund has not yet been billed for such service.

     in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. For DNP, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, such fees included $44,500 for services rendered in connection with  the registration statement for DNP's public offering.  
(2)   Audit-Related Fees are fees billed for assurance and related services by each Fund's principal accountant that are reasonably related to the  performance of the audit of the Fund's financial statements and are not reported under the caption "Audit Fees."  
(3)   Tax Fees are fees billed for professional services rendered by each Fund's principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.  In both years shown in the table, such services consisted of preparation of the annual federal and state income tax returns and excise tax returns for DNP, DUC and DTF. In the case of DPG, such services consisted of review of the Fund's annual  federal and excise tax returns and preparation and analysis of state income tax returns.  
(4)   All Other Fees are fees billed for products and services provided by each Fund's principal accountant, other than the services reported under the  captions "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees."  
(5)   Aggregate Non-Audit Fees are non-audit fees billed by each Fund's  accountant for services rendered to the Fund, the Adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund. During both years shown in the table, no portion of such fees  related to services rendered by each Fund's accountant to the Adviser or to any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund.  
(6)   No portion of these fees was approved by the audit committee after the beginning of the engagement pursuant to the waiver of the pre-approval requirement for certain de minimis non-audit services described in Section 10A of the 1934 Act and applicable regulations.

Communications with the Board by Shareholders and Other Interested Persons. The Board has adopted the following procedures for shareholders and other interested persons to send communications to the Board. Shareholders and other interested persons may mail written communications to the full Board, to committees of the Board or to specified individual directors in care of the Secretary of the Funds, 200 S. Wacker Drive, Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60606. All such communications received by the Secretary will be forwarded promptly to the full Board, the relevant Board committee or the specified individual directors, as applicable, except that the Secretary may, in good faith, determine that a communication should not be so forwarded if it does not reasonably relate to the Funds or their operations, management, activities, policies, service providers, Board, officers, shareholders, or other matters relating to an investment in the Funds or is purely ministerial in nature. Each of the Funds' directors is encouraged to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. All of the individuals who were directors of the Funds at the time of the March 13, 2018 joint annual meeting of the Funds' shareholders were in attendance at that meeting. 
Shareholder Proposals and Nominations. In order for any shareholder proposal or director nomination to be considered for inclusion in any Fund's proxy statement and form of proxy for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, such proposal or nomination must be received by the Secretary of the Fund no later than Tuesday, September 24, 2019. Under the circumstances described in, and upon compliance with, Rule 14a-4(c) under the 1934 Act, a Fund may solicit proxies in connection with the 2020 annual meeting which confer discretionary authority to vote on any shareholder proposals of which the Secretary of the Fund does not receive notice by Friday, December 13, 2019. Any notice of a shareholder proposal or director nomination must conform to the requirements in the Fund's bylaws. Copies of the bylaws of any of the Funds may be requested from the Secretary of the Funds, 200 S. Wacker Drive, Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60606. 
Solicitation of Proxies. Proxies will be solicited by mail. Proxies may be solicited by Fund personnel personally or by telephone, telegraph or mail, but such persons will not be specially compensated for such   services. The Funds will inquire of any record holder known to be a broker, dealer, bank or other nominee as to whether other persons are the beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons. If so, the Funds will supply additional copies of solicitation materials for forwarding to beneficial owners, and will make reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. In addition, the Funds have retained Computershare Inc. as proxy solicitor to assist the Funds in the solicitation of proxies at a fee of approximately $1,000 per Fund, plus reimbursement for reasonable out of pocket costs. 
Annual Report. Each Fund will provide without charge to any shareholder who so requests, a copy of the Fund's annual report for the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year. The annual reports for DNP, DUC and DTF are available by calling Hilliard Lyons toll-free at (833) 604-3163 and are also available on each such Fund's web site at www.dpimc.com/dnp, www.dpimc.com/duc and www.dpimc.com/dtf.

Wacker Drive, Suite 500, Chicago, Illinois 60606, for inspection by any shareholder during regular business hours for ten days prior to the date of the meeting.

As a shareholder, you can select the means by which you access those proxy materials. You can view the materials electronically via the Internet, or request a full set of printed materials for this Shareholder Meeting and all future meetings, or you can make that choice on a case by case basis. How do I access the materials, set my preference for future shareholder meeting materials and record my vote? On the front side of this Notice are easy to follow instructions on how to access Proxy materials electronically or request a full set of printed materials. Once you are on the website or ordering on the phone, you can also make your selection for future meetings. When you are ready to vote, electronic voting is available by Internet or Touch Tone Phone by using the Control Number and Security Code on the front of this Notice. The Touch Tone voting phone number is different from the ordering phone number and is displayed on the website. If you want to vote via Mail, you will need to request a paper copy of the materials to receive a Proxy Card and Return Envelope. If I request printed proxy materials, how long will it take for me to receive them? The SEC rule requires that the materials be sent via first class mail within three business days of receipt of your request.    DTF_30378_NA_122018_Pref
