  James is the right leader to take the Coca-Cola system to the next level. Dear Fellow Shareowners: On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank you for your investment in The Coca-Cola Company. This Board represents you as shareowners, and we take this role very seriously. We appreciate the trust you place in us to oversee your interests in our business. Chairman Succession We had a notable year in 2018, including announcing our Board leadership succession plan. In December, the Board of Directors elected James Quincey to become the 14th Chairman of the Board of The Coca-Cola Company. Assuming his reelection at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, James will succeed me as Chairman of the Board, and I will retire following the meeting. James will then serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. I am delighted that the Board elected James as Chairman. James is the right leader to take the Coca-Cola system to the next level. Without question, his ideas and instincts will continue to change our Company and system in important ways. As our business moves through the next decade, I can assure you that our Board will continue its oversight of the Company's long-term business strategy. This is one of the most important jobs of the Board. The Directors of our Company are actively engaged with James in executing a vision to continue evolving and growing as a total beverage company. 2018 Business Developments Over the last year, a great deal has been accomplished in our ongoing journey to position our business for continued growth. We ramped up investments to grow and diversify our portfolio through innovations, acquisitions and strategic partnerships. This work included: acquisitions like Costa Limited, which provides capabilities to build a global coffee platform, and investments such as BODYARMOR, one of the fastest-growing beverage trademarks in the U.S.; expanding existing brands like FUZE TEA and smartwater; and launching innovative new offerings like Coca-Cola with Coffee. We also continued to strengthen our bottling system, with actions including the completion of refranchising in North America, and we enhanced value for our customer partners worldwide. Importantly, we maintained our focus on doing business the right way. We know our business thrives when the communities we serve are also thriving. In 2018, we worked to create more community value in many ways, from supporting opportunities for women business owners, to promoting recycling globally through our World Without Waste initiative.

A LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 2
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Composition I became Chairman in 2009, and one of my priorities from day one was to ensure that the Board was made up of the most capable set of Directors possible. It is vital to have a Board that is equipped to oversee the success of the business and effectively represent the interests of our shareowners. As I retire, I'm very pleased with our current Board. We have a diverse, well-functioning Board composed of skilled, high-integrity Directors. The positive evolution of our Board over the last few years could not have been possible without Sam Nunn, who played an integral role as Lead Independent Director and who will retire following the 2019 Annual Meeting. I am confident our Board will continue to evolve under the leadership of James and our new Lead Independent Director, Maria Elena "Mel" Lagomasino, who will succeed Sam in that important role. I encourage you to review the qualifications, skills and experiences of all our Director nominees beginning on page 17. Farewell After more than 40 amazing years in the Coca-Cola system, my time with the Company is drawing to a close. It has been a journey that I have thoroughly enjoyed and loved. I'll take with me many dear friendships, fond memories and vital lessons learned along the way. I'm honored to have done my part for a business with a shining past and an even brighter future. Indeed, as a fellow shareowner, I am very confident that the best years for this business are ahead.         I am very confident that the best years for this business are ahead.

 3    Q&A with our Chief Executive Officer 
   The complexity of the global marketplace has increased exponentially; consumer tastes have evolved and will continue to do so; and our portfolio has grown to adapt to our changing environment.        The Board of Directors has elected you the next Chairman of the Board, pending your reelection to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. Could you talk about your expanded role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company? First, I appreciate the Board's confidence, and I value our partnership in leading the Company. I also greatly value the support I've received from our outgoing Chairman, Muhtar Kent. Muhtar has laid a foundation for success, and I'm excited to build on it. We are evolving as a total beverage company. This is a deliberately broad objective because the consumer landscape is changing very quickly, and we aim to be dynamic and anticipate evolutions in consumer tastes. One of the Board's most important jobs is oversight of our business strategy and, as Chairman, I will focus on pursuing that strategy. I can't overstate how greatly our Company has already changed in the last couple of decades. We were essentially a one-product company for much of our history, and we became highly successful by executing a model of selling more Coke in more places. The challenges and opportunities we see today are far different than ever before. The complexity of the global marketplace has increased exponentially; consumer tastes have evolved and will continue to do so; and our portfolio has grown to adapt to our changing environment. We are shaping a company that is equipped to deal with rapid changes and constant uncertainty. It's about taking a long-term view of the Company and where we should be headed, and as such, I will ensure that we relentlessly evaluate our portfolio, focusing on what works and stopping what doesn't. What strategic progress did the Company make in 2018? We had a strong year. Starting with our portfolio, it's always important to take a look at our core sparkling beverages. A strong core provides the fuel to grow the portfolio. The growth in sparkling soft drinks was part of an overall strategy to give consumers what they want. More consumers want drinks with no- or low-sugar, and that's one reason Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has done so well. We also innovated with existing products, notably through the relaunch of the Diet Coke brand in North America. We introduced new flavors and packaging, which helped to rejuvenate the brand. In fact, innovation launched over the past three years across our categories contributed to over 15% of total unit case volume in 2018. It's also important to innovate in how you drink, not just what you drink. This ranges from our equipment, like the debut of the latest-and-greatest Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, to our many forays and experiments in e-commerce. Without question, 2018 was a busy year for acquisitions. This included our acquisition of Costa Limited, which we announced in 2018 and closed in early 2019. We also invested in BODYARMOR and several other brands around the world. Finally, we continued to lift, shift and scale successful brands. FUZE TEA, for example, became a truly global brand through its roll-out across Europe at the beginning of 2018. Our smartwater brand was also introduced in more markets.

We also invested in BODYARMOR and several other brands around the world. Finally, we continued to lift, shift and scale successful brands. FUZE TEA, for example, became a truly global brand through its roll-out across Europe at the beginning of 2018. Our smartwater brand was also introduced in more markets. 
   The complexity of the global marketplace has increased exponentially; consumer tastes have evolved and will continue to do so; and our portfolio has grown to adapt to our changing environment.        The Board of Directors has elected you the next Chairman of the Board, pending your reelection to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. Could you talk about your expanded role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company? First, I appreciate the Board's confidence, and I value our partnership in leading the Company. I also greatly value the support I've received from our outgoing Chairman, Muhtar Kent. Muhtar has laid a foundation for success, and I'm excited to build on it. We are evolving as a total beverage company. This is a deliberately broad objective because the consumer landscape is changing very quickly, and we aim to be dynamic and anticipate evolutions in consumer tastes. One of the Board's most important jobs is oversight of our business strategy and, as Chairman, I will focus on pursuing that strategy. I can't overstate how greatly our Company has already changed in the last couple of decades. We were essentially a one-product company for much of our history, and we became highly successful by executing a model of selling more Coke in more places. The challenges and opportunities we see today are far different than ever before. The complexity of the global marketplace has increased exponentially; consumer tastes have evolved and will continue to do so; and our portfolio has grown to adapt to our changing environment. We are shaping a company that is equipped to deal with rapid changes and constant uncertainty. It's about taking a long-term view of the Company and where we should be headed, and as such, I will ensure that we relentlessly evaluate our portfolio, focusing on what works and stopping what doesn't. What strategic progress did the Company make in 2018? We had a strong year. Starting with our portfolio, it's always important to take a look at our core sparkling beverages. A strong core provides the fuel to grow the portfolio. The growth in sparkling soft drinks was part of an overall strategy to give consumers what they want. More consumers want drinks with no- or low-sugar, and that's one reason Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has done so well. We also innovated with existing products, notably through the relaunch of the Diet Coke brand in North America. We introduced new flavors and packaging, which helped to rejuvenate the brand. In fact, innovation launched over the past three years across our categories contributed to over 15% of total unit case volume in 2018. It's also important to innovate in how you drink, not just what you drink.

Q&A WITH OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 3
You have almost entirely new leaders in key positions running the business. How is this changing how the Company is managed?
I've mentioned all the initiatives to evolve our portfolio, from introducing new products to acquiring new brands. We have also made a number of management changes to help us implement our strategy.
We named Brian Smith as President and Chief Operating Officer in part to ensure we can execute our strategy. Brian oversees all of the Company's business units. I am pleased to have Brian in this role. He is a highly experienced operational leader. This will allow me to focus on our long-term business strategy, while remaining highly involved in key business initiatives and in our operations.
Under Brian, we have made many other changes in group presidents and business unit presidents. I'm excited about our new operational leadership team. Brian also oversees our newly created Global Ventures Group. Global Ventures will, among other things, ensure that our investments in Costa Limited, innocent, Monster Beverage Corporation and other areas are successful.
In other senior leadership changes, we appointed John Murphy to succeed Kathy Waller as Chief Financial Officer when she retires. John has extensive operational and financial experience in major markets around the world.
Altogether, we have a deep management team that puts us in a strong position for the future.
You were personally involved in the introduction of the Company's packaging initiative, World Without Waste. Why is this important to the business? What progress was made during the campaign's first year?
Stakeholders now expect more from us and all businesses. They want us to help find solutions and make a measurable and meaningful difference in the world. Investors at all levels continue to be interested in sustainability.
World Without Waste is important to our Company. Our goal is to help collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030. We also aim to make our packaging 100% recyclable by 2025 and to use 50% recycled material in our bottles and cans by 2030.
The first year of the strategy yielded strong results. Today, 87% of our packaging globally is recyclable. Some of our markets are using more than 25% recycled material in bottles and cans. Four countries are already selling a plastic bottle made from 100% recycled material. Internally, we are rapidly scaling our knowledge and skills to meet the challenge.
In December 2018, we announced that we will allow other companies, including competitors, to access our PlantBottle technology.
We believe a World Without Waste is possible. We are actively choosing to make a difference.
You travel around the world to visit the Company's operations. What's one of the most interesting things you saw in 2018?
I visited many countries in 2018, and I saw a lot of changes in the marketplace. For example, our top leaders traveled to China toward the end of the year. China has been a fast-growing market overall, of course, and it is an important growth engine for our Company in particular. I've visited China a number of times, but I'm always amazed at how much is new each time I go. You see more and more consumers making purchases that are entirely digital – where no cash is involved. It's also a place where our system is really embracing the rapid changes that are happening all around them. We're continually working to foster a growth-oriented culture at The Coca-Cola Company. We believe the best days are ahead of us, and that means we expect to continue to grow. When I see the changes our people are making in places like China, I am really encouraged.

Message From Sam Nunn, Lead Independent Director
At the end of last year, I announced my intention not to stand for reelection to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting. It has been my honor to serve as a Director of The Coca-Cola Company for the past 22 years, including the last five as Lead Independent Director.
I am pleased with our accomplishments as a Company, including the Board's partnership with management in long-term value creation for our shareowners. Most recently, the Board has provided oversight and guidance during the Company's evolution as a total beverage company.
This included ensuring an orderly and seamless management succession process, with James Quincey now set to succeed Muhtar Kent as Chairman following the 2019 Annual Meeting, assuming James' reelection. I know that I speak for the entire Board when I express sincere thanks to Muhtar for his outstanding leadership as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company, including his role in the transition to new leadership.
Together, Muhtar and James have led the effort to successfully position the business for continued growth. They have done this in a sustainable manner by maintaining focus on doing business the right way. In addition, they have assured that the Coca-Cola system is more aligned today than ever before. We have great confidence in James and the very capable management team he has put in place to steward the Company going forward.
As I retire, I can assure shareowners that this is a well-functioning Board comprised of highly capable Directors with the right mix of skills to work closely with management to help this business succeed.
It has been a priority of mine as Lead Independent Director to ensure that the Board has the right experience and the sound judgment to effectively represent the interests of shareowners and work with management to assure that we have the culture and strategy in place for sustainable success. We have instituted Board refreshment steps that include a robust Director selection process and regular Board, committee and Director evaluations.
I am particularly proud that in the last five years, five new Directors have been elected. If shareowners elect the nominees listed in this Proxy Statement, the average tenure for our Directors will stand at 10 years, and our Board's gender diversity average will be 38%. Our Board is now younger and more diverse with a strong reservoir of experience.
The Board, with great confidence, plans to assign the responsibility of Lead Independent Director to Mel Lagomasino. I want to briefly share what I believe this role means for the Company and for Board governance.
The Lead Independent Director plays a key role in helping guide the Board as it exercises its core duties in overseeing the Company's performance; strategic planning; risk management; succession planning; and talent development for senior executive positions.
The Lead Independent Director provides a key point of contact at the Board level for shareowners; leads the performance evaluation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; leads the annual Board evaluation process; and plays a key role in Board and management succession. The full set of responsibilities appears on page 28 of this Proxy Statement.
In cases where the role of the Chairman is combined with the role of Chief Executive Officer, many of our investors have said that a Lead Independent Director with clearly defined responsibilities provides an important, independent balance. As a Board, we agree. This will be the case once again when James and Mel, if reelected, become Chairman and Lead Independent Director, respectively, in April.
We know that the Board leadership structure is an important issue for many shareowners. Our Board believes that ensuring strong, independent Board leadership is a crucial requirement to building long-term shareowner value. Today, we believe the Company's traditional Board leadership structure with a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, alongside a strong Lead Independent Director, will deliver the best results for our business and our shareowners.
I am grateful for the trust you have placed in me as a member of the Board of this great Company. Thank you for your support and for your interest and investment in The Coca-Cola Company.

5 GOVERNANCE   Item 1 — Election of Directors
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ITEM 1       ►What am I voting on? Shareowners are being asked to elect 13 Director nominees for a one-year term. ►Voting recommendation:
    FOR the election of each Director nominee. The Board and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance believe the 13 Director nominees possess the necessary qualifications and experiences to provide quality advice and counsel to the Company's management and effectively oversee the business and the long-term interests of shareowners. 
[END TABLE]
Our Board currently has 16 members. Richard M. Daley, Muhtar Kent and Sam Nunn are not standing for reelection and will retire from the Board immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting, at which time the size of the Board will be reduced to 13 members. Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, the Board has nominated all the remaining 13 Directors for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. All the nominees are independent under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") corporate governance rules, except Herbert A. Allen and James Quincey (see Director Independence and Related Person Transactions beginning on page 38).
Each of the Director nominees was elected by the shareowners at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. If elected, each nominee will hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, if any nominee should become unable for any reason or unwilling for good cause to serve, proxies may be voted for another person nominated as a substitute by the Board, or the Board may reduce the number of Directors.
BOARD MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA
The Board and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance believe that there are general qualifications that all Directors must exhibit and other key qualifications and experiences that should be represented on the Board as a whole, but not necessarily by each individual Director.
QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED OF ALL DIRECTORS
The Board and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance require that each Director be a recognized person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field and be able to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company. Each Director must demonstrate innovative thinking, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices, an appreciation of multiple cultures and a commitment to sustainability and to dealing responsibly with social issues. In addition, potential Director candidates are interviewed to assess intangible qualities, including the individual's ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously, to work collegially.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CONSIDERATION OF DIVERSITY The Board does not have a specific diversity policy but fully appreciates the value of Board diversity. Diversity is important because a variety of points of view improves the quality of dialogue, contributes to a more effective decision-making process and enhances overall culture in the boardroom. In evaluating candidates for Board membership, the Board and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance consider many factors based on the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the Company's shareowners. This includes diversity of professional experience, race, ethnicity, gender, age and cultural background. In addition, the Board and the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance focus on how the experiences and skill sets of each Director nominee complement those of fellow Director nominees to create a balanced Board with diverse viewpoints and deep expertise.

5 GOVERNANCE   Item 1 — Election of Directors
The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance considers a wide range of factors when assessing potential Director nominees. This assessment includes a review of the potential nominee's judgment, experiences, independence, understanding of the Company's business or other related industries and such other factors as the Committee concludes are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board. A potential nominee's qualifications are considered to determine whether they meet the qualifications required of all Directors and the key qualifications and experiences to be represented on the Board, as described above. Further, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance assesses how each potential nominee would impact the skills and experiences represented on the Board as a whole in the context of the Board's overall composition and the Company's current and future needs.
BOARD COMPOSITION AND REFRESHMENT
When recommending to the Board the slate of Director nominees for election at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance strives to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, turnover, diversity and skills on the Board.
The Board believes that refreshment, including periodic committee rotation, is important to help ensure that Board composition is aligned with the needs of the Company and the Board as our business evolves over time, and that fresh viewpoints and perspectives are regularly considered. The Board also believes that over time Directors develop an understanding of the Company and an ability to work effectively as a group. Because this provides significant value, a degree of continuity year-over-year is beneficial to shareowners and generally should be expected.
Directors are elected each year, at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners, to hold office until the next Annual Meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. Because term limits could cause the loss of experience or expertise important to the optimal operation of the Board, there are no absolute limits on the length of time that a Director may serve, but the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance and the Board consider the tenure of Directors as one of several factors in nomination decisions. In addition, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance evaluates the qualifications and performance of each incumbent Director before recommending the nomination of that Director for an additional term. Furthermore, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Directors whose job responsibilities change or who reach the age of 74 are asked to submit a letter of resignation to the Board. These letters are considered by the Board and, if applicable, annually thereafter.
SHAREOWNER-RECOMMENDED DIRECTOR CANDIDATES
Shareowners who would like the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance to consider their recommendations for nominees for the position of Director should submit their recommendations in writing by mail to the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance in care of the Office of the Secretary, The Coca-Cola Company, P.O. Box 1734, Atlanta, Georgia 30301 or by e-mail to asktheboard@coca-cola.com. Recommendations by shareowners that are made in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration by the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance as other suggested nominees.
SHAREOWNER-NOMINATED DIRECTOR CANDIDATES
We have adopted a "Proxy Access for Director Nominations" bylaw after engaging with a number of our shareowners to understand their views on the desirability of proxy access and the appropriate proxy access structure for the Company. The proxy access bylaw permits a shareowner, or a group of up to 20 shareowners, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials Director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater), provided that the shareowner(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in Article I, Section 12 of our By-Laws. See question 33 on page 105 for more information.
MAJORITY VOTING STANDARD
Our By-Laws provide that, in an election of Directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of Directors to be elected, each Director must receive the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director. If a Director does not receive a majority vote, he or she has agreed that he or she would submit a letter of resignation to the Board. The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance would make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board would act on the resignation taking into account the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, which would include consideration of the vote and any relevant input from shareowners. The Board would publicly disclose its decision and its rationale within 100 days of the certification of the election results. The Director who tenders his or her resignation would not participate in the decisions of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance or the Board that concern the resignation.

Board and Committee Governance   GOVERNANCE 5
BOARD AND COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE 
ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board is elected by the shareowners to oversee their interests in the long-term health and overall success of the Company's business and financial strength. The Board serves as the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except for those matters reserved to or shared with the shareowners. The Board oversees the proper safeguarding of the assets of the Company, the maintenance of appropriate financial and other internal controls and the Company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance. The Board selects the Chief Executive Officer and oversees the members of senior management, who are charged by the Board with conducting the business of the Company.
OVERSIGHT OF STRATEGY
Oversight of the Company's business strategy and strategic planning is a key responsibility of the Board. The Board believes that overseeing and monitoring strategy is a continuous process and takes a multilayered approach in exercising its duties.
While the Board and its committees oversee strategic planning, Company management is charged with executing the business strategy. To monitor performance against the Company's strategic goals, the Board receives regular updates and actively engages in dialogue with our Company's senior leaders. These boardroom discussions are enhanced with "hands-on" experiences, such as market visits, which provide Directors an opportunity to see strategy execution first hand.
The Board's oversight and management's execution of business strategy are viewed with a long-term mindset and a focus on assessing both opportunities for and potential risks to the Company.
Table of Contents
5 GOVERNANCE   Board and Committee Governance
OVERSIGHT OF RISK
Inherent in the Board's responsibilities is an understanding and oversight of the various risks facing the Company. The Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision. The Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk taking is essential for the Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve the Company's long-term strategic objectives. Effective risk oversight is an important priority of the Board. The Board has implemented a risk governance framework designed to:
Table of Contents
Board and Committee Governance   GOVERNANCE 5
[BEGIN TABLE]
         CYBERSECURITY OVERSIGHT The Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, consumers and employees. To more effectively prevent, detect and respond to information security threats, the Company has a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer whose team is responsible for leading enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes. The Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Chief Information Security Officer and the Chief Information Officer on, among other things, the Company's cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen the Company's information security systems, assessments of the Company's security program and the emerging threat landscape. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters. 
[END TABLE]
To learn more about risks facing the Company, you can review the factors included in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Form 10-K"). The risks described in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that may currently be deemed to be immaterial based on the information known to the Company also may materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.
MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to oversee the development and retention of senior talent and to ensure that an appropriate succession plan is in place for our Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. The Management Development Committee, together with the Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews senior management talent, including readiness to take on additional leadership roles and developmental opportunities needed to prepare senior leaders for greater responsibilities. In addition, the Management Development Committee regularly discusses recommendations and evaluations from the Chief Executive Officer as to potential successors to fill senior positions. The Chief Executive Officer also provides a regular review to the Management Development Committee assessing the members of the executive leadership team and his or her potential to succeed him. This review includes a discussion about development plans for senior leaders to help prepare them for future succession and contingency plans in the event the Chief Executive Officer is unable to serve for any reason (including death or disability). While the Management Development Committee has the primary responsibility to develop succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer position, it regularly reports to the Board and decisions are made at the Board level.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
CURRENT STRUCTURE
The Company's governance framework provides the Board with the flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. In making determinations about the leadership structure, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the Company's shareowners.
While the Board has historically combined the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, in December 2016, the Board decided to split the roles when it appointed Mr. Quincey to succeed Mr. Kent as Chief Executive Officer and appointed Mr. Kent to continue as Chairman of the Board. This was done to facilitate an orderly Chief Executive Officer succession plan. Accordingly, our current leadership structure is comprised of a split Chairman of the Board, who is not independent, and Chief Executive Officer and a Lead Independent Director.
LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR 2019
In December 2018, Mr. Kent announced his intention not to stand for reelection at the 2019 Annual Meeting and to retire as Chairman of the Board immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board has elected Mr. Quincey to succeed Mr. Kent as the 14th Chairman of the Board. Assuming Mr. Quincey is reelected as a Director, he will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer following the 2019 Annual Meeting. Mr. Nunn also announced that he will not stand for reelection at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The independent Directors of the Board have elected Ms. Lagomasino to succeed Mr. Nunn as Lead Independent Director, contingent on her reelection as a Director at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Therefore, the Board leadership structure effective following the 2019 Annual Meeting will be comprised of a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, a Lead Independent Director, Board committees led primarily by independent Directors and active engagement by all Directors. The Board believes that this structure provides an effective balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent Directors.
Table of Contents
5 GOVERNANCE   Board and Committee Governance
The Board believes that having one person serve the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer can provide certain synergies and efficiencies that enhance the functioning of the Board and, importantly, allow it to most effectively execute its role in overseeing business strategy. The Company's business is complex, and its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Most of the Company's products are manufactured and sold by independent bottling partners throughout the world. The Chief Executive Officer maintains strong, hands-on relationships with the leaders of bottlers and remains close to the many facets of the business existing in so many places in the world. Because the Chief Executive Officer is the Board member closest to this vast and complex business, he or she is best able to identify many of the business issues that require Board attention and, as Chairman, can best focus Directors' attention on the most critical business matters. Further, in the Board's experience, the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer allows for timely and unfiltered communication with the Board on these critical business issues. The Board also believes that there are benefits when the same person represents both the Company and the Board throughout the world with bottlers, customers, consumers and other stakeholders.
Having the flexibility to select the appropriate structure based on the specific needs of the business is critical, and it is part of the judgment the Board believes it should exercise. Consistent with the Board's commitment to good corporate governance practices, at least one executive session of the non-employee Directors each year includes a review of the Board's leadership structure and consideration of whether the position of Chairman of the Board should be held by the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board believes that it is important to note that all Directors play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at the Board and committee levels. As part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the non-employee Directors meet in executive session without the Chief Executive Officer present. These meetings allow non-employee Directors to discuss issues of importance to the Company, including the business and affairs of the Company as well as matters concerning management, without any member of management present.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The duties and responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the Lead Independent Director are described in the table below and are set forth in the Company's By-Laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines.

BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS
The Board recognizes that a robust and constructive evaluation process is an essential component of good corporate governance and Board effectiveness. Through this process, Directors provide feedback and assess Board, committee and Director performance, including areas where the Board believes it is functioning effectively and areas where the Board believes it can improve.
EVALUATION COMPONENTS – BOARD, COMMITTEES, DIRECTORS
Under the leadership of the Lead Independent Director, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees the Board's annual evaluation process focused on three components:

[END TABLE]
MULTI-STEP EVALUATION PROCESS
The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance periodically reviews the format of the evaluation process, including whether to utilize a third-party facilitator, to ensure that actionable feedback is solicited on the operation and effectiveness of the Board, Board committees and Director performance. The evaluation process includes the steps described below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1  Questionnaire  Directors provide feedback regarding:   
 2  Committee Chairs Meet  Committee chairs meet to provide feedback and input prior to the annual Board closed self-evaluation session. 
 3  One-on-One Discussions with Lead Independent Director  Every other year, the Lead Independent Director conducts separate, one-on-one sessions with each Director to review the results of the questionnaire, as well as to discuss any additional feedback or perspectives. 
 4  Committee/Board Closed Sessions  Each committee and the full Board conduct separate closed self-evaluation sessions. The results of the questionnaire, the Lead Independent Director sessions, the committees' self-evaluations and other feedback are discussed by the Board. 
 5  Feedback Incorporated  Based on the evaluation results, changes in practices or procedures are considered and implemented, as appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
INCORPORATION OF FEEDBACK
Our multi-step evaluation process generates robust comments and discussion at all levels of the Board, including with respect to Board composition and processes. These evaluation results have led to changes designed to increase Board effectiveness and efficiency. For example, over the last few years, enhancements have been made regarding meeting materials, the structure of the Board, committee and executive session discussions, the Board evaluation process, the Director on-boarding process and providing Directors with more opportunities for continuing education and to have hands-on experiences with our business, senior leaders and emerging talent around the world. In addition, as a result of the evaluation process, the Board implemented annual Board innovation awards to help drive a culture of innovation that balances rapid iteration, disciplined execution, entrepreneurial audacity, intelligent risk taking and continuous learning from failure to build the capabilities the Company needs for long-term growth. The Board also created the Millennial Advisory Council as a way for millennials at the Company to share their perspectives directly with the Board.

SHAREOWNER ENGAGEMENT
Our Board believes that shareowners should have line of sight into decisions made in the boardroom. We do this by making a full-time effort of building relationships and trust over time with our shareowners. We have for some time cultivated meaningful and value-added relationships with our shareowners through an engagement program that is management-led and overseen by the Board.
SHAREOWNER ENGAGEMENT
Our long-standing commitment to shareowner engagement includes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   An engagement program that is management-led and overseen by the Board 
   Dedicated resources to actively engage with shareowners on a variety of topics throughout the year 
   Engagements designed to address questions and concerns, seek input and provide perspective on Company policies and practices 
[END TABLE]
Feedback from shareowner engagement is considered by the Board and reflected in enhancements to policies and practices. For instance, we engaged with and solicited feedback from our shareowners on the key changes we were making to our executive compensation program, which were adopted in 2018.
In addition to direct engagement, the Company has instituted a number of complementary mechanisms that allow shareowners to effectively communicate viewpoints with the Board, including:
PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT
We participate in public policy discussions on issues related to our industry and business priorities, our more than 700,000 Coca-Cola system associates, our shareowners and the communities we serve.
In the U.S., our Company and our affiliated political action committees comply with applicable laws and other requirements regarding contributions to political organizations; candidates for federal, state and local public office; ballot measure campaigns; political action committees; and trade associations. We engage with these organizations and individuals to make our views clear and uphold our commitment to help support the communities in which we operate. We base our U.S. political contributions on many considerations, supporting candidates whose priorities align with those of our Company when it comes to core issues that affect our business.
The Public Issues and Diversity Review Committee reviews our advocacy efforts, including political contributions. See page 32 for more information about the Public Issues and Diversity Review Committee. Additional information about our public policy engagement efforts, including our political contributions policy and a report of U.S. political contributions from our Company and from associate-funded programs, which include The Coca-Cola Company Nonpartisan Committee for Good Government and various other state political action committees, can be viewed on our Company website, www.coca-colacompany.com, by clicking on "Investors" then "Corporate Governance" and then "Public Policy Engagement."

      SUSTAINABILITY In everything we do, we aim to strengthen the foundations of our business and the communities we serve so all can thrive long into the future. We recognize that the sustainability of our business is directly linked to the sustainability of the communities we call home. Each decision our Company makes is a chance for us to do the right thing. Our approach to sustainability is guided by our vision to create shared opportunity and make a positive difference in the world. Working collaboratively with our bottling partners and stakeholders at every stage of our value chain, we look to integrate sustainability into our everyday actions. We share best practices and knowledge across the Coca-Cola system to build business resiliency and better manage water resources. From ingredient sourcing to packaging recovery, we strive to create shared opportunity through growth in every corner of the world, with an ongoing focus on enabling the economic empowerment of women along the way. As the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company, we have a responsibility to use water as respectfully and efficiently as possible. We are continuously looking for ways to reduce water use in our operations, while treating our wastewater to the highest standards. Food and beverage packaging is an important part of our modern lives, yet the world has a packaging problem, which we have a responsibility to help solve. By investing in our planet and our packaging, we can help make the world's packaging problem a thing of the past. The Public Issues and Diversity Review Committee reviews the nature and scope of the Company's sustainability goals and the Company's progress toward achieving those goals.

5 GOVERNANCE   Director Compensation
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding all matters pertaining to compensation paid to Directors for Board, Lead Independent Director, committee and committee chair service. Under the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance's charter, the Committee is authorized to engage consultants or advisors in connection with its review and analysis of Director compensation, although it did not engage any consultants or advisors in 2018.
In making non-employee Director compensation recommendations, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance takes various factors into consideration, including, but not limited to, the responsibilities of Directors generally, as well as committee chairs, and the form and amount of compensation paid to Directors by comparable companies. The Board reviews the recommendations of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance and determines the form and amount of Director compensation.
Director compensation is provided under The Coca-Cola Company Directors' Plan (the "Directors' Plan"). Directors who also serve as employees of the Company do not receive payment for service as Directors.
2018 ANNUAL COMPENSATION
In 2018, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance undertook a review of the compensation paid to our Directors relative to the Company's comparator group (see page 60) and other publicly available information. Based on this review, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance recommended, and the Board agreed, that no changes should be made to Director compensation in 2018. Except as described below, there have been no increases in compensation paid to our Directors since 2013.
In 2018, our non-employee Directors received an annual cash retainer of $50,000. In addition, each non-employee Director who served as a committee chair in 2018 received an additional $20,000 in cash. Cash retainers are paid on a quarterly basis. Under the Directors' Plan, non-employee Directors have the option of deferring all or a portion of their cash compensation into share units that are paid out in cash after leaving the Board.
Non-employee Directors also receive an annual equity retainer of $200,000, credited in deferred share units. The number of share units awarded is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased on the open market for $200,000 on April 1 (or the immediately preceding business day if April 1 is not a business day). Share units do not have voting rights but are credited with hypothetical dividends that are reinvested in additional units to the extent dividends on Common Stock are received by shareowners. Share units are paid out in cash on the later of (i) January 15 of the year following the year in which the Director leaves the Board and (ii) six months after the Director leaves the Board. Directors may elect to take their payout in a lump sum or in up to five annual installments.
In February 2019, in part due to shareowner feedback, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance reviewed the practices at our compensation comparator group with respect to the compensation of lead independent directors.  Based on this review, the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance determined that the Company should provide an additional cash retainer for the Lead Independent Director. Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, the Board approved a cash retainer of $30,000 for the position of Lead Independent Director effective April 24, 2019. No other changes were made to the compensation paid to our Directors for 2019.
Directors do not receive fees for attending Board or committee meetings. Non-employee Directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with Board-related activities.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
Highlights of Director Compensation Program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Emphasis on equity: ties the majority of Directors' compensation to shareowner interests because the value of share units fluctuates up or down depending on the stock price 
►  Long-term focus: focuses on the long term, since the share units are not paid until after the Director leaves the Board 
►  Market competitive: in line with peers and is equitable based on the work required of Directors serving an entity of the Company's size and scope  
►  No fees: no fees are paid for Board meeting attendance  
►  Governance: includes governance features that prohibit hedging and pledging and short sales of our Common Stock and restricts trading to limited windows 
[END TABLE]
The following table details the total compensation of the Company's non-employee Directors for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Ms. Botín deferred a portion of her 2018 cash compensation into 860 share units. Messrs. Daley, Kotick and Weinberg each deferred their 2018 cash compensation into 1,147 share units. Ms. Lagomasino and Messrs. R. Allen, Diller and Nunn each deferred their 2018 cash compensation into 1,606 share units. The number of share units is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased for the deferred amount based on the average of the high and low prices of a share of Common Stock on March 29, 2018.
STOCK AWARDS (COLUMN (c))
The amounts reported in the Stock Awards column reflect the grant date fair value associated with each non-employee Director's share units that are required to be deferred under the Directors' Plan, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation–Stock Compensation ("ASC Topic 718").

In addition, infrequently, spouses and guests of Directors may travel on Company aircraft for personal reasons when the aircraft is already going to a specific destination for a business reason, which has minimal incremental cost to the Company. When this occurs, a nominal amount is included in the All Other Compensation column. In addition, income is imputed to the Director for income tax purposes and the Director is not provided a tax reimbursement. In 2018, the total amount allocated for such spouse and guest travel was $1,000 attributable to Mses. Gayle, Herman and Tsay.
PERQUISITES AND OTHER PERSONAL BENEFITS The Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's matching gifts program, which is the same program available to all U.S.-based employees and retirees. In 2018, this program matched up to $10,000 of charitable contributions on a two-for-one basis to tax-exempt arts, cultural, environmental and educational organizations. The amounts paid by the Company to match gifts made by the non-employee Directors in 2018 under this program are set forth in the table above. The total cost of matching contributions on behalf of the non-employee Directors for 2018 gifts was $42,000.
For Directors who elected coverage prior to 2006 (Mr. Nunn), the Company provides medical and dental coverage on the same terms and at the same cost as available to U.S. Company employees. This coverage was discontinued in 2006 for all other Directors. The total cost for this health coverage in 2018 was $10,917.
To help expand the Directors' knowledge of the Company's products, the Company provides certain products to Directors' offices without charge. The Company cost for providing products to the non-employee Directors is set forth in the adjacent table. The total cost incurred by the Company in 2018 for products provided to non-employee Directors was $17,187.
INSURANCE PREMIUMSFor Directors who elected coverage prior to 2006 (Messrs. R. Allen, Diller and Nunn), the Company provides life insurance coverage, which includes $30,000 term life insurance and $100,000 group accidental death and dismemberment insurance. This coverage was discontinued in 2006 for all other Directors. The Company cost for this insurance for participating non-employee Directors is set forth in the table below. The total cost for these insurance benefits to the participating non-employee Directors in 2018 was $2,160.
Business travel accident insurance coverage of $200,000 is provided to all non-employee Directors while traveling on Company business, at a Company cost of $5 per Director per year.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
INDEPENDENCE DETERMINATIONS
Under the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board must consist of a majority of independent Directors. In making independence determinations, the Board observes NYSE and SEC criteria and considers all relevant facts and circumstances. Under NYSE corporate governance listing standards, to be considered independent:
Table of Contents
Director Independence and Related Person Transactions   GOVERNANCE 5
CATEGORICAL STANDARDS
The following will not be considered material relationships that would impair a Director's independence:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Immaterial Nonprofit Relationship  The Director or any member of his or her immediate family serves as an executive officer of a charitable or educational organization which receives contributions from the Company in a single fiscal year of less than $1 million or 2% of that organization's consolidated gross revenues, whichever is more. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, when determining Director independence, the Board does not consider transactions:
The Board, through its Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, annually reviews all relevant business relationships any Director nominee and any person who served as a Director during 2018 may have with the Company. As a result of its annual review, the Board has determined that none of the following Director nominees has a material relationship with the Company and, as a result, such Director nominees are independent: Ronald W. Allen, Marc Bolland, Ana Botín, Christopher C. Davis, Barry Diller, Helene D. Gayle, Alexis M. Herman, Robert A. Kotick, Maria Elena Lagomasino, Caroline J. Tsay and David B. Weinberg. In addition, the Board determined that Richard M. Daley and Sam Nunn, who will serve as Directors until the 2019 Annual Meeting, are independent. None of the Directors who were determined to be independent had any relationships that were outside the categorical standards identified above.
Muhtar Kent is Chairman of the Board and also served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer through April 30, 2017, and therefore is not an independent Director. James Quincey has served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer since May 1, 2017, and therefore is not an independent Director. Even though Herbert A. Allen is not currently determined to be independent, he contributes greatly to the Board and the Company through his wealth of experience, expertise and judgment.
All the Directors who serve as members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance are independent as required by the NYSE corporate governance rules. Under these rules, Audit Committee members also satisfy the separate SEC and NYSE independence requirements, and the Compensation Committee members satisfy the additional SEC and NYSE independence requirements.

A "Related Person" means:
In general, the Company will enter into or ratify Related Person Transactions with Directors only when the Board, acting through the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, determines that the Related Person Transaction is reasonable and fair to the Company. When considering whether a Related Person Transaction is reasonable and fair to the Company, the Committee considers, among other things, the evaluation of the transaction by employees directly involved and the recommendation of the Chief Financial Officer. In addition, any Related Person Transaction involving an executive officer must be pre-approved by the Chief Executive Officer and any Related Person Transaction involving the Chairman of the Board (if an employee of the Company), Chief Executive Officer or a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock must be submitted to the Audit Committee for approval.
Table of Contents
Director Independence and Related Person Transactions   GOVERNANCE 5
Many transactions that constitute Related Person Transactions are ongoing, and some arrangements predate any relationship with the Director or predate the Director's relationship with the Company. When a transaction is ongoing, any amendments or changes are reviewed, and the transaction is reviewed annually for reasonableness and fairness to the Company.
Identifying possible Related Person Transactions involves the following procedures:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Directors, Director nominees, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock are asked to complete customary annual questionnaires. 
►  Directors and Director nominees are required to annually verify and update information about (i) where the Director is an employee, director or executive officer; (ii) each entity where an immediate family member of a Director is an executive officer; (iii) each firm, corporation or other entity in which the Director or an immediate family member is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest; and (iv) each charitable or educational organization where the Director or an immediate family member is an employee, executive officer, director or trustee. 
[END TABLE]
When the Company receives the requested information from its Directors, Director nominees, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, the Company compiles a list of all persons and entities, including all subsidiaries of the entities identified, that may give rise to a Related Person Transaction. The Office of the Secretary reviews the updated list and expands the list if necessary, based on a review of SEC filings, Internet searches and applicable websites.
For 2018, the list of approximately 4,600 persons and entities was distributed within the Company to identify any potential transactions. This list was also sent to each of the Company's approximately 400 accounting locations to be compared to payments and receipts. All ongoing transactions, along with payment and receipt information, were compiled for each person and entity. The information was reviewed and relevant information was presented to the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance or the Audit Committee, as applicable.
Details regarding Related Person Transactions are included in the charters for the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance and the Audit Committee and in our Codes of Business Conduct. These documents can be found on the Company's website, www.coca-colacompany.com, by clicking on "Investors" and then clicking on "Corporate Governance."
CERTAIN RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
The Board, acting through the Audit Committee or the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance, as applicable, believes that the following Related Person Transactions between the Company and its Directors and beneficial owners of more than 5% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock are reasonable and fair to the Company.
Herbert A. Allen. Herbert A. Allen, one of our Directors, is President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Allen & Company Incorporated ("ACI") and a principal shareowner of ACI's parent. ACI is an indirect equity holder of Allen & Company LLC ("ACL").
ACI has leased and subleased office space since 1977 in a building owned by one of our subsidiaries and located in New York City. ACI was a tenant prior to the subsidiary's acquisition of the building. In June 2005, ACI assigned the lease and sublease to ACL. In November 2015, the lease was renewed for a term of approximately 18 years. In 2018, ACL paid approximately $5.7 million in rent and related expenses.

 ITEM 2       ►What am I voting on? Shareowners are being asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 48 and the Compensation Tables beginning on page 69. ►Voting recommendation:
    FOR the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. The Compensation Committee takes very seriously its role in the governance of the Company's compensation programs and values thoughtful input from shareowners. The Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the advisory vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. 
[END TABLE]
The Company seeks a non-binding advisory vote from its shareowners to approve the compensation of its Named Executive Officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 48 and the Compensation Tables beginning on page 69.
In deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board encourages you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Compensation Tables sections. In 2018, we made several key enhancements to our compensation programs to continue to improve the link between compensation and the Company's business and talent strategies as well as the long-term interests of our shareowners.
The Board recommends that shareowners vote FOR the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareowners approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Tables and the related narrative."
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board values shareowners' opinions, and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the advisory vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. The Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual advisory votes from shareowners on executive compensation. The next such vote will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners.

Message from the Compensation Committee   COMPENSATION 7
MESSAGE FROM THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
In early 2017, James Quincey announced new strategic priorities aimed at continuing to drive our transformation as a total beverage company. Mr. Quincey became Chief Executive Officer later that year and since then has steered the Company through a period of fundamental changes in the industry. One of the cornerstones of this work has involved shaping a growth-oriented culture at all levels of the organization.
We, the Compensation Committee, are committed to ensuring that our compensation programs help drive the Company's focus on disciplined growth. To align our 2018 compensation programs to this strategy, we conducted a comprehensive review to ensure that we incentivize growth and continue to pay for performance while also focusing on key growth metrics and long-term shareowner value. During this process, we listened to feedback from employees, leaders and shareowners.
We refreshed our 2018 talent and compensation philosophy to focus more sharply on employee performance and the future potential to drive long-term growth, with a strong emphasis on accountability to deliver the right work in the right way. We introduced enhancements to annual incentive and performance-based equity programs, which included measures focused on driving growth, differentiation and segmentation, as well as simplicity and transparency.
Our renewed compensation programs deliver highly differentiated rewards for employees who make outstanding contributions to the Company. Our programs are also intended to help shift the Company's culture, encouraging employees to be fast, agile, empowered and accountable.
Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes specific program design changes in 2018 and individual compensation decisions and rationales for the 2018 Named Executive Officers. We remain committed to listening to shareowner feedback as we continue to evaluate and refine the Company's compensation programs.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    To explain the rationale behind changes to our compensation framework, we have added "Compensation Committee Insights" throughout this CD&A, which highlight changes made in the last twelve months. We hope that you find them useful and welcome your feedback.

7 COMPENSATION   Compensation Discussion and Analysis
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides a detailed description of our executive compensation philosophy and programs, the compensation decisions the Compensation Committee has made under those programs and the factors considered in making those decisions. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis focuses on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for 2018, who are listed below and appear in the Compensation Tables beginning on page 69.
In 2018, we announced key changes in top leadership. Mr. Kent announced his intention to retire as Chairman of the Board following the 2019 Annual Meeting and, contingent on his reelection as a Director, the Board elected Mr. Quincey to serve as the next Chairman of the Board. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Smith assumed the role of President and Chief Operating Officer, an appointment which will allow Mr. Quincey more time to focus on the long-term strategic direction and success of the Company as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, while allowing Mr. Smith to lead the Company's day-to-day operations and bring an accelerated focus on executing key strategies. We also announced a succession plan for the Chief Financial Officer role following Ms. Waller's retirement. Effective March 16, 2019, Mr. Murphy, who currently serves as Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer, will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
The titles below for our Named Executive Officers represent their current position with the Company. Please see 2018 Compensation Decisions for Named Executive Officers beginning on page 62 and our Summary Compensation Table on page 69 for each Named Executive Officer's role during fiscal year 2018.

ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We provide three elements of total direct compensation: base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentives, which are described below. We also provide limited perquisites (see page 59) and standard retirement and benefit plans (see pages 67 and 106).
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary                        Fixed cash compensation based on the market-competitive value of the skills and knowledge required for each role. Reviewed and adjusted when appropriate to maintain market competitiveness. Increases are not automatic or guaranteed. 
 Annual Incentive        Designed to reward results in the prior year. Annual cash incentives based on:  ►Company financial metrics chosen to drive our growth strategy (net operating revenue and operating income)  ►Individual performance
 Long-Term Incentives        Forward-looking equity awards intended to motivate and reward potential to drive future growth and align the interests of employees and shareowners. Grants awarded in the form of stock options and performance share units. 2018 performance measures:  ►Net operating revenue ►Earnings per share ►Free cash flow ►Total shareowner return modifier
►Performance levels necessary to achieve our long-term goals and deliver superior shareowner returns ►The likelihood of achieving various levels of performance based on historical results over a ten-year period ►Metrics, program designs and results at companies in our comparator group ►Performance relative to our comparator companies  To evaluate performance in a manner consistent with how management evaluates our operating results and trends, the key financial metrics in our annual and long-term incentive plans are measured on a non-GAAP basis. We make certain adjustments when calculating these results, such as for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, items impacting comparability, changes in financial accounting reporting regulations and costs and other financial implications associated with corporate transactions. Our targets are currency neutral because the Compensation Committee believes incentive targets should measure the underlying results of the business, and business leaders should be encouraged to make decisions that drive long-term sustainable growth rather than to address short-term currency fluctuations. This philosophy has been in place for several years, and we review this issue regularly, as it is an important concern for global companies like ours with significant exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

BASE SALARY
Base salary is fixed cash compensation delivered in return for day-to-day job responsibilities, leadership skills and experience. The Compensation Committee annually reviews base salary of our Named Executive Officers at its February meeting and makes adjustments when appropriate based on market competitiveness. Market competitive base salaries help attract and retain executive talent. The Compensation Committee may also make periodic adjustments in connection with promotions or changes in responsibility. Base salary is not intended to reward past performance.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What was the rationale for changing the Company performance metrics for the 2018 annual incentive awards? To align with the Company's new growth strategy, we refined our 2018 annual incentive performance metrics as follows:    Net operating revenue aligns with the Company's growth focus, by reflecting how we are sustainably growing top-line performance. Operating income is a bottom-line performance measure of the profitability of our primary business operations. Both measures provide employees line of sight to influence results. In addition, they are widely used measures to evaluate the success of our business by investors. Removing unit case volume helps focus on our growth strategy and helps support the transformation to a total beverage company by incentivizing revenue growth through multiple levers, rather than just through volume growth. How has the new scorecard guided the Committee's determinations with respect to the individual performance amount? The scorecard provides a framework to more clearly define specific action items in three key areas: leadership, operational, and people and culture. Our assessment of these outcomes was a key factor in determining the level of discretion to apply to each Named Executive Officer's individual performance amount for their 2018 annual incentive award.

*   Net operating revenue growth is organic, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items, as applicable, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the impact of accounting changes. Operating income growth is comparable currency neutral (adjusted for structural items and accounting changes), which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of structural changes and the impact of accounting changes. Items impacting comparability include asset impairments, productivity and reinvestment initiatives, transaction gains/losses and other items. Structural items generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling and distribution operations. Accounting changes refer to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), which was adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2018. Using these adjusted measures of net operating revenue and operating income growth are appropriate because it provides a more consistent comparison against the prior year.

Name       Base Salary (12/31/2018) ($)       Target (%)       Target Annual Incentive ($)        Business Performance Factor (%) 
1  For Mr. Murphy, the Business Performance Factor was weighted 50% for Overall Company Performance (at 163%), 25% for Asia Pacific Group performance (at 136%) and 25% for Bottling Investments Group performance (at 171%). 
2  For Mr. Smith, the Business Performance Factor was weighted 50% for Overall Company Performance (at 163%) and 50% for Europe, Middle East and Africa Group performance (at 163%). 
[END TABLE]
Individual Performance AmountsFor the Named Executive Officers, consideration is given for contributions to overall Company results and operational goals; contributions toward global strategic initiatives; and individual contributions toward evolving the Company's culture to accelerate our transformation to a high-performing growth business. An Individual Performance Amount may be awarded based on an assessment of an executive's individual performance throughout the year as guided by the individual's scorecard. The maximum percentage of an individual's target award that could be awarded for individual performance in 2018 was reduced from 50% to 30%, and the Compensation Committee determined that no Named Executive Officer would receive an Individual Performance Amount exceeding 5% of his or her target award in 2018.

    What was the rationale for changing the Company performance metrics for the 2018 long-term performance-based awards? To align with our new growth strategy, we refined the 2018 performance metrics for the performance share units awarded to our Named Executive Officers as follows:    We believe these measures are the right metrics to evaluate the Company's long-term performance. Each of these metrics has a strong correlation to shareowner value, is easy to understand and will drive and reward growth behaviors and actions. Specifically, net operating revenue aligns with the Company's focus on growth by reflecting how we are sustainably growing top-line performance year-over-year; earnings per share is a key measure of profitability for our shareowners and reflects the Company's focus on shareowner value; and free cash flow reflects our ability to generate the cash needed to pay dividends, among other things, and enables the business to grow over the long term. We retained the relative total shareowner return modifier to further tie awards to long-term shareowner value. Beginning in 2018, the Company now refers to our performance share units as growth share units, highlighting that a primary goal of these awards is to incentivize employees to drive growth.

7 COMPENSATION   Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview The Company grants long-term incentive compensation to reward performance over the longer term and align the interests of employees with shareowners. The majority of these awards are performance-based. In 2018, all annual long-term incentive awards were equity-based for our Named Executive Officers. All equity awards are subject to our Equity Stewardship Guidelines. An update regarding our 2018 progress against these guidelines is included below under Equity Stewardship Guidelines and Scorecard.

OTHER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS The vast majority of equity awards are made as part of the annual long-term incentive grants in February of each year. During the year, a limited number of additional equity awards may be granted, either as time-based restricted stock units or performance-based awards.
From time to time, we establish additional performance-based programs related to specific performance goals to motivate and reward for specific initiatives. No Named Executive Officer received such awards in 2018.
EQUITY STEWARDSHIP GUIDELINES AND SCORECARD We have adopted Equity Stewardship Guidelines, which specify how we will use long-term equity compensation with respect to the global employee population.

HOW WE MAKE COMPENSATION DECISIONS
SHAREOWNER ENGAGEMENT AND RESULTS OF 2018 ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Company has a long-standing shareowner outreach program and routinely interacts with shareowners on a number of matters, including executive compensation (see page 33). For instance, as part of our comprehensive review of the Company's compensation programs, we listened to shareowners regarding the level of discretion that was exercised in the executive annual incentive plan in past years and developed scorecards for our most senior executives that identify the categories on which they will be assessed for the 2018 performance year and thereafter. We also engaged with and solicited feedback from shareowners on the other key changes we were making to our executive compensation programs.

7 COMPENSATION   Compensation Discussion and Analysis
[BEGIN TABLE]
ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses the Board's evaluation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and makes preliminary determinations about their base salary, annual  incentive and long-term equity compensation. The Compensation Committee then discusses the compensation recommendations with the full Board, and the Compensation Committee approves final compensation decisions after this discussion.  
ROLE OF THE CEO For other Named Executive Officers, the Chief Executive Officer considers performance and makes individual recommendations to the Compensation Committee on base salary, annual incentive and long-term  equity compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews, discusses, modifies and approves, as appropriate, these compensation recommendations. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RESOURCES AND TOOLS The Compensation Committee uses several resources and tools, including competitive market information and "tally sheets," which quantify each of the compensation elements as well as  accumulated outstanding long-term equity awards and deferred compensation. 
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION COMPARATOR GROUP
We use a comparator group of companies when making certain compensation decisions. The comparator group is used as a reference point, but compensation paid at other companies is not the only factor in the decision-making process. As noted above, our employees operate in the much larger Coca-Cola system but, when comparing size with comparator companies, we utilize only the net operating revenue and market capitalization of The Coca-Cola Company. In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the companies that comprise the compensation comparator group and determined no changes to the group were necessary for 2018.
The table below shows our criteria on how the comparator group was chosen and how it is used.
[BEGIN TABLE]
►Comparable size based on net operating revenue and market capitalization ►Major global presence with sales and operations outside of the U.S. ►Large consumer products business ►Market-leading brands or category positions as defined by Interbrand ►Financially strong companies ►Available compensation data ►As an input in developing base salary ranges, annual incentive targets and long-term incentive award ranges ►To evaluate share utilization by reviewing overhang levels and annual run rate ►To benchmark the form and mix of equity awarded to employees ►To benchmark share ownership guidelines ►To assess the competitiveness of total direct compensation awarded to senior executives ►To assess talent and recruitment practices ►To compare Company performance and validate whether executive compensation programs are aligned with Company performance ►As an input in designing compensation plans, benefits and perquisites  AT&T Inc.

ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION CONSULTANT
COMPENSATION CONSULTANT INDEPENDENCE: The Compensation Committee is authorized by its charter to employ independent compensation consultants and other advisors. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") to serve as its independent consultant. Meridian reports directly to the Compensation Committee.
In accordance with the Compensation Committee's Independent Compensation Consultant Policy, prior to the retention of a compensation consultant (or any other external advisor), and annually thereafter, the Compensation Committee assesses the independence of the compensation consultant. Under the Independent Compensation Consultant Policy, a consultant is considered independent if:
The Compensation Committee assessed Meridian's independence under the Independent Compensation Consultant Policy, including considering the following factors specified in the NYSE listing standards: (i) the provision of other services by the consulting firm to the Company; (ii) the amount of fees paid as a percentage of the total revenue of the consulting firm; (iii) the policies and procedures of the consulting firm that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of the consultant with a member of the Compensation Committee; (v) any stock of the Company owned by the consultant; and (vi) any business or personal relationship of the consultant or consulting firm with an executive officer of the Company. Meridian provided the Compensation Committee with confirmation of its independent status under the Independent Compensation Consultant Policy. Based on this evaluation, the Compensation Committee has determined that Meridian met the criteria for independence.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into the Form 10-K.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
The Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of the four independent Directors listed above. No member of the Compensation Committee is a current, or during 2018 was a former, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. During 2018, no member of the Compensation Committee had a relationship that must be described under the SEC rules relating to disclosure of Related Person Transactions. In 2018, none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers serving on the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Company.

1  Principal position reflects position held as of December 31, 2018. 
2  In order to show the effect that the year-over-year change in pension value had on total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, we have included an additional column to show total compensation minus the change in pension value. The amounts reported in the Total Without Change in Pension Value column may differ substantially from the amounts reported in the Total column required under SEC rules and are not a substitute for total compensation. Total Without Change in Pension Value represents total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, minus the change in pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column (but including the nonqualified deferred compensation earnings reported in that column, if any). The change in pension value is subject to many external variables, such as interest rates, that are not related to Company performance. Therefore, we do not believe a year-over-year change in pension value is helpful in evaluating compensation for comparative purposes and instead, believe shareowners may find the accumulated pension benefits in the 2018 Pension Benefits table on page 78 a more useful calculation of the pension benefits provided to the Named Executive Officers. 
3  Mr. Quincey served as President through December 31, 2018. 
4  Ms. Waller transitioned her responsibilities as President, Enabling Services effective January 1, 2019. Ms. Waller is retiring from the Company on March 15, 2019. 
5  Mr. Kent will be resigning from his role as Chairman of the Board following the 2019 Annual Meeting and will retire from the Company on April 30, 2019. 
6  Effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Murphy was elected Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Murphy will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective March 16, 2019. Compensation for Mr. Murphy is only provided for 2018 because he was not a Named Executive Officer for 2017 or 2016. 
7  Effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Smith was elected President and Chief Operating Officer. Compensation for Mr. Smith is provided only for 2018 and 2017 because he was not a Named Executive Officer for 2016. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
7 COMPENSATION   Compensation Tables
SALARY (COLUMN (c))
The amount in the Salary column represents the base salary earned by each of the Named Executive Officers in the applicable year.
STOCK AWARDS (COLUMN (e))
The amount in the Stock Awards column is the grant date fair value of stock awards determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718. For 2018, all the stock awards reported in the Stock Awards column are PSUs granted under the 2014 Equity Plan, which pay in stock if predetermined performance metrics are met over a three-year period.
If a PSU's minimum performance measure is not met, no award is earned. For grants made in 2018, if at least the minimum performance measure is attained, awards range from 50% to 200% of the target number of shares. In addition, the PSUs are subject to a relative TSR modifier. The relative TSR modifier will reduce or increase the amount of shares earned by 25% if TSR over the three-year performance period relative to our compensation comparator group falls outside of a defined range. See page 56 for more information about the relative TSR modifier.
The amounts for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table above reflect the value of the annual PSU grants at the target (or 100%) level. The table below provides the potential value of the 2018 annual PSU grants at the threshold, target and maximum levels. The metrics, targets and status of the outstanding PSU programs are described beginning on page 57.
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  Pursuant to the relative TSR modifier on PSU awards, the amount of shares earned will be reduced or increased by 25% if TSR over the three-year performance period relative to our compensation comparator group (see page 60) falls outside of a defined range. 
[END TABLE]
The assumptions used by the Company in calculating these amounts are incorporated herein by reference to Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K. To see the value actually received upon vesting of stock by the Named Executive Officers in 2018, refer to the 2018 Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 76. Additional information on all outstanding stock awards is reflected in the 2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table beginning on page 75.
OPTION AWARDS (COLUMN (f))
The amounts reported in the Option Awards column represent the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted under the 2014 Equity Plan to each of the Named Executive Officers, calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718.
The assumptions used by the Company in calculating these amounts are incorporated herein by reference to Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K. To see the value actually received upon exercise of options by the Named Executive Officers in 2018, refer to the 2018 Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 76. Additional information on all outstanding option awards is reflected in the 2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table beginning on page 75.
NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN COMPENSATION (COLUMN (g))
The amounts reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column reflect the amounts earned by each Named Executive Officer under the Company's annual Performance Incentive Plan. The Annual Incentive Compensation section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which begins on page 53, describes how the 2018 Performance Incentive Plan awards to the Named Executive Officers were determined.
CHANGE IN PENSION VALUE AND NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION EARNINGS (COLUMN (h))
The amounts reported for each year in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column are comprised of changes in the actuarial present value of the accumulated pension benefits of each of the Named Executive Officers under the applicable pension plan during such year.
Pension values may fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on a number of factors, including age, years of service, average annual earnings and the assumptions used to determine the present value, such as the discount rate. The assumptions used by the Company in calculating the
Table of Contents
Compensation Tables   COMPENSATION 7
change in pension value are described on page 78. For 2018, the discount rate assumption used to determine the actuarial present value of accumulated pension benefits was higher than in 2017. For Ms. Waller, $0 is reported for 2018 because there was a decrease of $113,124 in the present value of her pension benefit. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in the discount rate assumption.
The Company cautions that the values reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column are theoretical as those amounts are calculated pursuant to SEC requirements and are based on assumptions used in preparing the Company's audited financial statements for the applicable fiscal years. The Company's retirement plans utilize a different method of calculating actuarial present value for the purpose of determining a lump sum payment, if any. The change in pension value from year to year as reported in the table is subject to market volatility and may not represent the value that a Named Executive Officer will actually accrue or receive under the Company's retirement plans during any given year.
None of the Named Executive Officers received above-market or preferential earnings (as these terms are defined by the SEC) on their nonqualified deferred compensation accounts.
The material provisions of the Company's retirement plans and deferred compensation plans in which the Named Executive Officers participate are described in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 106.
ALL OTHER COMPENSATION (COLUMN (i))
The amounts reported in the All Other Compensation column reflect, for each Named Executive Officer, the sum of (i) the incremental cost to the Company of all perquisites and other personal benefits; (ii) the amount of any tax reimbursements; (iii) the amounts contributed by the Company to applicable Company 401(k) and savings plans; and (iv) the dollar value of life insurance premiums paid by the Company. Amounts contributed to Company 401(k) and savings plans are calculated on the same basis for all participants in the relevant plan, including the Named Executive Officers. The material provisions of the Company 401(k) and savings plans in which the Named Executive Officers participate are described in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 106.
The following table outlines those perquisites and other personal benefits and additional all other compensation required by SEC rules to be separately quantified for 2018. A dash indicates that the Named Executive Officer received the perquisite or personal benefit but the amount was not required to be disclosed under SEC rules. The narrative following the table describes all categories of perquisites and other personal benefits provided by the Company in 2018.
AIRCRAFT USAGEThe Company owns and operates business aircraft to allow employees to safely and efficiently travel for business purposes around the world. Given the Company's significant global presence, we believe it is a business imperative for senior leaders to be on the ground at our global operations. The Company aircraft allow employees to be far more productive than if commercial flights were utilized, as the aircraft provide a confidential and highly productive environment in which to conduct business without the schedule constraints imposed by commercial airline service.
The Company aircraft are made available to the Named Executive Officers for their personal use in the following situations:
Table of Contents
7 COMPENSATION   Compensation Tables
When the aircraft is already flying to a destination for business purposes, only the direct variable costs associated with the additional passenger (for example, catering) are included in determining the aggregate incremental cost to the Company. While it happens very rarely, if an aircraft travels empty before picking up or after dropping off a passenger flying for personal reasons, this "deadhead" segment would be included in the incremental cost attributable to overall travel.
CAR AND DRIVER Mr. Kent is provided with a car and driver in the U.S. both for security purposes and to maximize his efficiency during business hours. When not being utilized by Mr. Kent, the car and driver are used for other Company business. However, the Company has included the entire cost of the car and driver, including all salary, benefits and related employment costs. A car and driver are also made available to Mr. Kent in Turkey for security purposes. No other Named Executive Officer is provided with a car or driver.
SECURITY The Company provides a security program for Mr. Kent. This includes monitoring equipment at his homes and Company-paid security personnel. No other Named Executive Officer is provided with Company-paid security, except where necessary when traveling overseas.
INTERNATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAM BENEFITS The Company provides benefits to globally mobile associates under various international service programs, the material provisions of which are described on page 108. These programs are designed to relocate and support employees who are sent on an assignment outside of their home country. The purpose of the programs is to make sure that when the Company requests that an employee move outside his or her home country, economic considerations do not play a role. This helps the Company quickly meet its business needs around the world and develop its employees.
In connection with Mr. Quincey's appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer and to support his transition to Atlanta from the UK, Mr. Quincey received benefits under an international service program through April 30, 2017. Certain benefits related to his participation in the program were paid in 2018 and may be paid in future years.
Mr. Murphy participated in an international service program for all of 2018 because he was a citizen of Ireland based in Singapore. Mr. Murphy relocated to the U.S. in January 2019 and will remain in the program through 2020. Benefits related to his participation in the program were paid in 2018 and will continue to be paid in future years.
Mr. Smith participated in an international service program through July 31, 2016 because he was a U.S. citizen based in Mexico. Currently, Mr. Smith is based in the U.S. and therefore no longer participates in the program. However, certain benefits related to his participation in the program were paid in 2018 and may be paid in future years.

FINANCIAL AND TAX PLANNING The Company provides a taxable reimbursement to the Named Executive Officers for financial planning services, which may include tax preparation and estate planning services. No tax gross-ups are provided to the Named Executive Officers for this benefit.
OTHER PERQUISITES The Company makes available executive physicals to executives, including the Named Executive Officers.
ADDITIONAL ALL OTHER COMPENSATION Tax Reimbursement The amounts reported in the table on page 71 represent tax reimbursements for certain Named Executive Officers. All amounts for 2018 are related to business use of the Company aircraft. No Named Executive Officer is provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of aircraft, but Named Executive Officers are provided a tax reimbursement for taxes incurred when a spouse or significant other travels for business purposes. These taxes are incurred because of the Internal Revenue Service's extremely limited rules concerning business travel by non-employees. It is sometimes necessary for spouses or significant others to accompany Named Executive Officers to business functions. In contrast to personal use, the Company does not believe an employee should pay personally when spousal or significant other travel is required or important for business purposes.
To calculate taxable income, the Standard Industry Fare Level rates set by the Internal Revenue Service are used. Where a tax reimbursement is authorized, it is calculated using the highest marginal federal tax rate, applicable state rate and Medicare rates. The rate used to calculate taxable income has no relationship to the incremental cost to the Company associated with the use of the aircraft.
Company Contributions to Company 401(k) and Savings Plans The Company makes matching contributions to Named Executive Officers who participate in applicable Company 401(k) or savings plans on the same terms and using the same formulas as other participating employees. In 2018, all Named Executive Officers except for Mr. Murphy participated in the Company 401(k) Plan and Supplemental 401(k) Plan.
The amounts reported in the table on page 71 represent the following contributions in 2018:
In 2018, Mr. Murphy participated in the Mobile Employees Retirement Plan, which is included in the 2018 Pension Benefits table on page 78.
Life Insurance Premiums The Company provides life insurance to U.S.-based employees, including the Named Executive Officers. In 2018, this coverage was equal to the lesser of 1.5 times pay or $2 million. The amounts reported in the table on page 71 represent the premiums paid for this insurance by the Company.

2018 PENSION BENEFITS
The Company provides retirement benefits from various plans to its employees, including the Named Executive Officers. Due to the Company's global operations, it maintains different plans to address different market conditions, various legal and tax requirements and different groups of employees.
In 2018, all Named Executive Officers except Mr. Murphy participated in or had a benefit under The Coca-Cola Company Pension Plan (the "TCCC Pension Plan") and The Coca-Cola Company Supplemental Pension Plan (the "TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan"). In 2018, Mr. Murphy participated in the Mobile Employees Retirement Plan (the "Mobile Plan"). Mr. Quincey has a benefit under the Mobile Plan for the period he was covered under an international service program. Additional details of these plans are described in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 106. The table above reflects the present value of benefits accrued by each of the Named Executive Officers from the applicable plans.
Compensation used for determining pension benefits under the TCCC Pension Plan, the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan and the Mobile Plan generally includes only salary and short-term cash incentives. The amounts reflected for each plan represent the present value of the maximum benefit payable under the applicable plan. In some cases, the payments may be reduced for early retirement or by benefits paid by other Company-sponsored retirement plans, statutory payments or Social Security.
The Company generally does not grant additional years of benefit service, and no Named Executive Officer has been credited with additional years of benefit service.
The discount rate assumption used by the Company in calculating the present value of accumulated benefits was 4.30% for the TCCC Pension Plan and 4.28% for the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan. Additional assumptions used by the Company in calculating the present value of accumulated benefits are incorporated herein by reference to Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K. The calculations assume that the Named Executive Officer continues to live at least until the earliest age at which an unreduced benefit is payable.
The Company's retirement plans utilize a different method of calculating actuarial present value for the purpose of determining a lump sum payment, if any. The traditional pension benefit under the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan is paid in the form of an annuity if the employee has reached at least age 55 with ten years of service at the time of his or her separation from the Company. Therefore, Ms. Waller and Messrs. Kent and Smith are required to take the traditional pension benefit portion of their TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan benefit in the form of an annuity.

2018 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The following table provides information on the Named Executive Officers' participation in The Coca-Cola Company Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, as applicable. These plans either allow eligible employees to defer part of their salary and annual incentive on a voluntary basis or make employees whole when the Company matching contribution is limited under the tax-qualified plan. The Company matching contribution under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan was provided at the same rate as the match in the 401(k) Plan. The Company does not match any additional voluntary deferrals.
Additional details of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan are described in the Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 106.

The Deferred Compensation Plan and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan do not guarantee a return on deferred amounts. For these plans, no amounts included in column (d) are reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table because the plans do not provide for above-market or preferential earnings.
AGGREGATE BALANCE AT LAST FISCAL YEAR-END (COLUMN (f))

7 COMPENSATION   Payments on Termination or Change in Control
PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
GENERAL
Most of the Company's plans and programs contain specific provisions detailing how payments are treated upon termination or change in control. The specific termination and change in control provisions under these plans, which are described below, apply to all participants in each plan. The termination scenarios described in this section include voluntary separation, involuntary separation, disability and death. For more information on the plans described below, see Summary of Plans in Annex B beginning on page 106.
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER RETIREMENTS
As noted above, Ms. Waller will be retiring from the Company on March 15, 2019. On October 17, 2018, the Company provided Ms. Waller a letter detailing the terms of her separation. Pursuant to her letter, among other things, Ms. Waller will receive severance benefits under the terms of The Coca-Cola Company Severance Pay Plan (the "TCCC Severance Plan") upon her retirement. If Ms. Waller remains employed through March 15, 2019, she will receive an annual incentive award for 2019, prorated for two and one-half months and payable in March 2020. Ms. Waller will not receive any further equity grants. All of Ms. Waller's outstanding equity incentive awards will be treated in accordance with the related equity plans and related agreements (see the 2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table beginning on page 75). Ms. Waller's retirement benefits will consist of those benefits accrued and vested under the standard terms and conditions of the plans in which she participates.
On April 30, 2019, Mr. Kent will retire from the Company. Upon retirement, Mr. Kent will receive only the retirement and other benefits he is entitled to under the standard terms of the applicable Company programs. He will not receive any severance benefits.
In accordance with the SEC's rules, the remainder of this section assumes that employment for each of Ms. Waller and Mr. Kent was terminated or a change in control of the Company occurred as of December 31, 2018 and does not take into account the terms of Ms. Waller's separation letter described above or Mr. Kent's retirement.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
The change in control provisions in the various Company plans were adopted to mitigate the concern that, in the event the Company is considering a change in control transaction, the employees involved in considering the transaction might otherwise be motivated to act in their own interests rather than the interests of the shareowners. Thus, the change in control provisions are designed with the intention of ensuring that employees are neither harmed nor given a windfall in the event of a change in control. The Company's plans generally provide that a change in control may occur upon (i) a greater than 20% change in ownership of the Company; (ii) a change of the majority of the Board within a two-year period; or (iii) certain merger and consolidation transactions. As described below, Company equity plans include "double-trigger" change in control provisions.
The Company does not have individual change in control agreements and no tax gross-up is provided for any taxes incurred as a result of a change in control payment. The Board can determine prior to the potential change in control that no change in control will be deemed to have occurred.
SEVERANCE PLAN
All the Named Executive Officers are covered by the TCCC Severance Plan.
TERMINATION, DEATH, DISABILITY
Generally, benefits are payable under the TCCC Severance Plan when an employee is terminated involuntarily due to certain circumstances, such as an internal reorganization or position elimination. The maximum cash severance benefit under this plan is two years of base pay, payable as a lump sum.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
There are no separate change in control provisions included in the TCCC Severance Plan.
Table of Contents
Payments on Termination or Change in Control   COMPENSATION 7
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
All the Named Executive Officers participated in the annual Performance Incentive Plan in 2018.
TERMINATION, DEATH, DISABILITY
Generally, participants employed on December 31 are eligible to receive a cash incentive for the year, regardless of whether employment continues through the payment date. Employees who (i) terminate employment prior to December 31 who are at least 55 years of age with ten years of service; (ii) die; or (iii) move to an affiliate generally receive a prorated incentive based on actual Company performance and the portion of the year actually worked.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
Upon a change in control, participants receive the target amount of the annual incentive after the end of the performance year. This amount is prorated if the participant leaves during the year.
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
All the Named Executive Officers except Mr. Murphy were eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2018. However, not all chose to participate.
TERMINATION, DEATH, DISABILITY
Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, employees who terminate employment after age 50 with five years of service receive payments based on elections made at the time they elected to defer compensation. Other employees receive a lump sum after termination. Individuals who are designated as "specified employees" under Section 409A of the Tax Code may not receive payments for at least six months following termination of employment to the extent the amounts were deferred after January 1, 2005. There are no enhanced benefits payable under the Deferred Compensation Plan upon a participant's death or disability.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
Upon a change in control, any Company discretionary contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan vest. No Named Executive Officers have received a Company discretionary contribution.
EQUITY PLANS
All the Named Executive Officers participated in the Company's equity plans in 2018.
TERMINATION
The treatment of equity upon termination of employment depends on the reason for the termination and the employee's age and length of service at termination. The table below details the termination provisions of the various equity award types.
[BEGIN TABLE]
PSUs   All PSUs are forfeited if separation occurs prior to satisfaction of performance measures and holding requirements.  For grants held at least 12 months, the employee receives the same number of earned shares as active employees after the results are certified.  Outstanding PSUs held at least 12 months will not be forfeited and a prorated amount will be released after the results are certified. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
7 COMPENSATION   Payments on Termination or Change in Control
DEATH
If an employee dies, all options vest if the options have been accepted. The employee's estate has five years from the date of death to exercise the options. Provided they have been accepted, restricted stock and restricted stock units vest and are released to the employee's estate. Provided the PSUs have been accepted, if death occurs during the performance period, the employee's estate receives a cash payment equal to the value of the target number of shares. For PSUs where performance has been certified, the employee's estate receives a cash payment based on the certified results within 90 days.
DISABILITY
If an employee terminates employment because of disability, all options become nonforfeitable, and the employee has the full remaining term to exercise the options. Restricted stock and restricted stock units vest and are released to the employee. For PSUs in the performance period, the employee receives shares equal to the number of shares that the employee would have earned based on actual performance after the end of the performance period.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
Beginning with awards in 2015, the treatment of equity upon a change in control is governed by the 2014 Equity Plan. Awards granted prior to 2015 were governed by applicable plans and agreements. The table below details the double-trigger change in control provisions of the various equity award types if awards are assumed by the successor company. If awards are not assumed by the successor company, accelerated vesting generally occurs upon a change in control.
RETIREMENT AND 401(K) PLANS
All the Named Executive Officers except Mr. Murphy were participants in the TCCC Pension Plan, the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan in 2018. Mr. Murphy participated in the Mobile Plan in 2018. Mr. Quincey has a benefit under the Coca-Cola UK Stakeholder Pension Plan (the "UK Savings Plan") related to a prior period of employment.
TERMINATION, DEATH, DISABILITY
No payments may be made under the TCCC Pension Plan or the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan until an employee has separated from service and met eligibility requirements. Generally, no payments may be made under the 401(k) Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan or the Mobile Plan until separation from service, except distributions may be taken from the 401(k) Plan after age 59½ and distributions related to mandatory tax payments may be made under the Mobile Plan, whether or not the employee has terminated employment.
Individuals who are designated as "specified employees" under Section 409A of the Tax Code, which include the U.S.-based Named Executive Officers, may not receive payments from the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan or the Mobile Plan for at least six months following termination of employment.
There are no enhanced benefits payable under the TCCC Pension Plan, the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the 401(k) Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, the Mobile Plan, or the UK Savings Plan upon a participant's death or disability.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
The TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan contain change in control provisions that affect all participants equally, including the participating Named Executive Officers. These provisions provide an enhanced benefit to vested participants for benefits accrued under the defined benefit formula if certain conditions are met, including that the employee must actually leave the Company within two years of a change in control. A change in control has no effect on the cash balance portion of the TCCC Pension Plan and there are no additional credited years of service. Upon a change in control under the TCCC Pension Plan and the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan, the earliest retirement age is reduced resulting in an enhanced benefit for participants who have not reached the earliest retirement age.
The 401(k) Plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, the Mobile Plan and the UK Savings Plan do not have special provisions for change in control.

QUANTIFICATION OF PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following table and footnotes describe the potential payments to the Named Executive Officers upon termination of employment or a change in control of the Company as of December 31, 2018. While Ms. Waller and Mr. Kent will be retiring in 2019, this section assumes the applicable triggering event occurred on December 31, 2018.
The table does not include:

2  Represents the intrinsic value of the acceleration of vesting of any stock options that vest upon the event. Intrinsic value is the difference between the exercise price of the stock option and the closing price of Common Stock, which was $47.35 on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year. 
3  No amounts are included for the 2016-2018, 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 PSU programs for Voluntary Separation, Involuntary Termination and Disability because the PSUs remain subject to performance requirements even after the event. See page 57 for the status of these PSU programs. 
4  For Mr. Quincey, represents the value of a more favorable early retirement subsidy in the event of a change in control and subsequent termination. No other Named Executive Officer would receive a pension enhancement upon a change in control. 
[END TABLE]
VOLUNTARY SEPARATION (COLUMN (a))
Amounts are included under "Stock Options" and "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" for Ms. Waller and Messrs. Kent and Smith because each has satisfied the age and service requirement for acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held for at least 12 months. The amount included in "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" for these Named Executive Officers reflects the value of the shares earned under the 2015-2017 PSU program. Messrs. Quincey and Murphy have not satisfied the age and service requirement for acceleration of any equity awards, and therefore, no additional payments would be triggered upon voluntary separation.
INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION (COLUMN (b))
Amounts are included under "Stock Options" and "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" for Ms. Waller and Messrs. Kent and Smith because each has satisfied the age and service requirement for acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held for at least 12 months. Amounts are included under "Stock Options" and "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" for Messrs. Quincey and Murphy because involuntary termination triggers continued vesting of equity awards granted beginning in 2013 after the age and service requirement has been met. The amount included in "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" reflect the value of the shares earned under the 2015-2017 PSU program.
DEATH (COLUMN (c))
Amounts are included under "Stock Options" and "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" because death triggers acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards. The amounts for "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" reflect (i) the value of the shares earned under the 2015-2017 PSU program; (ii) the value of the target number of shares granted under the 2016-2018, 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 PSU programs; and (iii) for Mr. Quincey, the value of time-based restricted stock units.
DISABILITY (COLUMN (d))
Amounts are included under "Stock Options" and "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" because termination of employment caused by disability triggers acceleration of vesting or continued vesting of certain equity awards. The amounts for "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" reflect (i) the value of the shares earned under the 2015-2017 PSU program; and (ii) for Mr. Quincey, the value of time-based restricted stock units.
CHANGE IN CONTROL (COLUMN (e))
Amounts are included under "Stock Options" and "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" for all Named Executive Officers because a change in control triggers acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards. Since equity awards have double-trigger change in control provisions, the table above assumes that both a change in control and a subsequent termination of employment have occurred. The amounts for "PSUs and Restricted Stock Units" reflect (i) the value of the shares earned under the 2015-2017 PSU program; (ii) the value of the number of shares granted under the 2016-2018 PSU program at the maximum award level; (iii) the value of the number of shares granted under the 2017-2019 PSU program at the maximum award level, prorated for two years of the performance period; (iv) the value of the number of shares granted under 2018-2020 PSU program at the target award level, prorated for one year of the performance period; and (iv) for Mr. Quincey, the value of time-based restricted stock units.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION
Share units credited under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan and the Directors' Plan are not included in the table above since payouts under those plans are in cash.
The Company or its applicable subsidiary provides a matching contribution in Common Stock under various plans throughout the world. No shares are issued by the Company under any of these plans, and therefore these plans are not included in the table above. Shares are purchased on the open market by a third-party trustee. These plans are exempt from the shareowner approval requirements of the NYSE. These plans are as follows:
401(k) and Savings Plans (U.S.). There are several 401(k) and savings plans in the U.S. that include a Company matching contribution component, including the Company's primary plan, the 401(k) Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, the Company matches employee contributions up to a maximum of 3.5% of an employee's compensation, subject to limits imposed by the Tax Code. Employees vest in the matching contributions over two years. Generally, employees may not withdraw the matching contributions until termination of employment. The other 401(k) and savings plans that include a Common Stock matching contribution component match employee contributions up to a maximum of between 3% to 6% of an employee's compensation, subject to limits imposed by the Tax Code, include vesting provisions of between two and three years and have similar withdrawal restrictions as the 401(k) Plan.
The Coca-Cola Export Corporation Employee Share Savings Scheme (UK). The company matches employee contributions to a maximum of £1,500 per year. The employee is vested in the matching contributions once a month when matching shares of Common Stock are purchased. However, the matching shares of Common Stock may not be withdrawn before a five-year holding period without adverse tax consequences.
Employees' Savings and Investment Plan of Coca-Cola Ltd. (Canada). After completing 12 months of employment and a specified minimum hours of service, the company matches 50% of an employee's contributions of 7% to 3.5% of eligible earnings, based on an employee's date of employment. The employee is immediately vested in the matching contributions. However, the matching contributions may not be withdrawn until termination of employment.
Table of Contents
7 COMPENSATION   Pay Ratio Disclosure
Employee Savings and Investment Plan of Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Company (Canada). After one year of employment, the company matches 50% of a full-time employee's contributions of 2% to 6% (union) or 2% to 7% (non-union) of eligible earnings, up to a maximum of 3% or 3.5%, as applicable. The employee is immediately vested in the matching contributions. However, the matching contributions may not be withdrawn until termination of employment.
Employee Stockholding Program (Japan). The employee must be employed for at least three years in order to participate, and the company matches contributions up to 1.8% of an employee's annual base salary. The employee is immediately vested in the matching contributions. However, the matching contributions may not be withdrawn until the employee terminates from the company or the employee requests to terminate from the plan. Specific regulations apply for cases when employees request to terminate from the plan.
Share Savings Plan (Denmark). The company matches contributions up to 3% of an employee's salary. The employee is immediately vested in the matching contributions. However, the matching contributions may not be withdrawn for ten years without tax liability.
The Company also sponsors employee share purchase plans in several jurisdictions outside the U.S. The Company does not grant or issue Common Stock pursuant to these plans, but does facilitate the acquisition of Common Stock by employees in a cost-efficient manner. These plans are not equity compensation plans.
PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
REQUIRED PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
Under the SEC rules, the Company is required to provide the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Quincey, who served as its Chief Executive Officer throughout 2018, to the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company (the "Pay Ratio Disclosure"). The Company selected October 1, 2018 as the determination date for identifying the median employee. For 2018, we are providing the Company's required Pay Ratio Disclosure, as well as a supplemental Pay Ratio Disclosure, which we believe provides a more representative comparison to our Pay Ratio Disclosure for 2017.
Since October 1, 2017, the date as of which the Company last identified its median employee, the Company experienced a significant change in its employee population, which changed our median employee compensation.
Since October 1, 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  The Company completed the refranchising of its bottling territories in North America. As a result, 19,960 employees who were included in the calculation of the Pay Ratio Disclosure for 2017 are not included in the calculation of the required Pay Ratio Disclosure for 2018. 
►  The Company completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited ("CCBA"). As a result of the consolidation of CCBA, 17,054 CCBA employees were included in the calculation of the required Pay Ratio Disclosure for 2018 who were not included in the calculation of the required Pay Ratio Disclosure for 2017.

For context, most of the Company's branded beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independent bottling partners. From time to time, the Company acquires or takes control of bottling operations where it believes it can use its resources and expertise to improve performance. The Company also periodically sells its ownership interest in bottlers to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency.
For 2018, the median annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than the Chief Executive Officer) was $16,440. Mr. Quincey's annual total compensation for 2018, as reported under the "Total" column (column (j)) in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, was $16,701,328. Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median annual total compensation of all other employees was estimated to be 1,016 to 1.
To identify, and to determine the annual total compensation of, the median employee, we used the following methodology:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  We collected the payroll data of all employees globally, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis as of October 1, 2018. 
►  We annualized the compensation of all permanent full-time and part-time employees who were hired by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries between January 1 and October 1, 2018. We applied an exchange rate as of October 1, 2018 to convert all foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. 
►  We used total base pay as of October 1, 2018 as our consistently applied compensation measure. We identified all employees within 5% of the median, and from this group used statistical sampling to select an employee as a reasonable representative of our median employee. 
[END TABLE]
Using this methodology, we determined that the median employee was a non-exempt, full-time, hourly employee located in South Africa with an annual total compensation

of $16,440 for 2018, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, which includes base pay, overtime pay and an employer retirement contribution.
Both the required and supplemental Pay Ratio Disclosures are reasonable estimates. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, the Pay Ratio Disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.
SUPPLEMENTAL PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
In addition to the Pay Ratio Disclosure required by the SEC's rules, we are also providing a supplemental pay ratio that excludes all 17,054 employees of CCBA as of October 1, 2018 in the calculation of the median annual total compensation of all employees. We believe this is helpful context, as the Company plans to hold its controlling interest in CCBA temporarily. The Company has presented the financial position and results of operations of CCBA as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition (as reported in Notes 1 and 2 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K). Therefore, we believe a global employee population that excludes CCBA employees provides a more representative comparison to our Pay Ratio Disclosure for 2017.
Excluding all CCBA employees as of October 1, 2018, for 2018, the median annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than the Chief Executive Officer) was $35,878. For 2018, the resulting ratio of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median annual total compensation of all other employees, excluding employees of CCBA, was estimated to be 466 to 1.
We identified the median employee for purposes of the supplemental pay ratio using the same methodology as the required Pay Ratio Disclosure. Our median employee was a non-exempt, full-time, hourly employee located in the United States with an annual total compensation of $35,878 for 2018, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, which includes base pay, overtime pay, quarterly incentives and the Company's matching contribution to that employee's 401(k) plan, as well as the change in pension value during 2018 under the TCCC Pension Plan.

The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board that outlines its responsibilities and the practices it follows. You can view the charter on the Company's website, www.coca-colacompany.com, by clicking on "Investors," then "Corporate Governance," then "Board Committees & Charters." The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its charter at least annually and, when appropriate, recommends to the Board changes to the Charter to reflect the evolving role of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is composed entirely of non-employee Directors who meet the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to members of the Audit Committee under SEC and NYSE rules.

Report of the Audit Committee   AUDIT MATTERS 8
OVERSIGHT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. In its meetings with representatives of the Independent Auditors, the Audit Committee asks them to address, and discusses their responses to, several questions that the Audit Committee believes are particularly relevant to its oversight.
These questions include:
The Audit Committee believes that using these questions to help focus its discussions with the Independent Auditors promotes a more meaningful dialogue that provides a basis for its oversight judgment.
The Audit Committee also discussed with the Independent Auditors those matters required to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the Independent Auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Auditors' communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the Independent Auditors their independence. The Audit Committee considered with the Independent Auditors whether the provision of non-audit services provided by them to the Company during 2018 was compatible with their independence.
2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In its oversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management, which has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for preparing the financial statements and other reports, and of the Independent Auditors, who are engaged to audit and report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the Independent Auditors the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant accounting judgments and estimates and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. In addressing the quality of management's accounting judgments, members of the Audit Committee asked for management's representations and reviewed certifications prepared by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer that the unaudited quarterly and audited consolidated financial statements of the Company fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, and have expressed to both management and the auditors their general preference for conservative policies when a range of accounting options is available.
In reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the reports of the Independent Auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

8 AUDIT MATTERS   Item 3 - Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ITEM 3       ►What am I voting on? Shareowners are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, to serve as the Company's Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the Independent Auditors, as a matter of good corporate governance, the Board submits its selection of the Independent Auditors to our shareowners for ratification. If the shareowners should not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. ►Voting recommendation:
    FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors. 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has the sole authority and responsibility to hire, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the Company's Independent Auditors and, in its capacity as a committee of the Board, is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and general oversight of the work of the Independent Auditors.
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as Independent Auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. EY (including its predecessors) has served as the Company's Independent Auditors since 1921.
ANNUAL EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

8 AUDIT MATTERS   Item 3 - Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors
AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of services provided by the Independent Auditors.
Under the policy, pre-approval is generally provided for work associated with the following:
For each proposed service, the Independent Auditors provide the Audit Committee with a description of the service and sufficient information to confirm the Independent Auditors' determination that the provision of such service will not impair the Independent Auditors' independence.
The Audit Committee has approved in advance certain permitted services whose scope is routine across business units, including statutory or other financial audit work for non-U.S. subsidiaries that is not required for the 1934 Act audits.
OTHER INFORMATION
The Company has been advised by EY that neither the firm, nor any covered person of the firm, has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in any capacity in the Company or its subsidiaries.
One or more representatives of EY will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Ratification of the appointment of the Independent Auditors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of Common Stock voting in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

 ITEMS 4-5       ►What am I voting on? The following two proposals were submitted by shareowners. If a shareowner proponent, or a representative who is qualified under state law, is present and submits a proposal for a vote, then the proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners. Approval of each of the following proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of Common Stock voting in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting. In accordance with federal securities regulations, we included the shareowner proposals plus any supporting statements exactly as submitted by the proponents. To make sure readers can easily distinguish between materials provided by the proponents and materials provided by the Company, we have placed a black box around the materials provided by the proponents and a red box around the materials provided by the Company. ►Voting recommendation:
   AGAINST each of the shareowner proposals. 
 ITEM 4   SHAREOWNER PROPOSAL REGARDING AN INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIR The International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund, 25 Louisiana Avenue, NW, owner of 200 shares of Common Stock, submitted the following proposal: 
[END TABLE]
For these purposes, a director shall not be considered "independent" if, during the last three years, he or she— 
The policy should be implemented so as not to violate any contractual obligations and should specify the process for selecting a new independent chairman if the chairman ceases to be independent between annual meetings of shareholders or if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chairman.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT:
The Board of Directors, led by its chairman, is responsible for protecting shareholders' long-term interests by providing independent oversight of management, including the Chief Executive Officer, in directing the corporation's affairs. This oversight can be diminished when the chairman is not independent.
Board oversight is of critical importance at the Company given the recent leadership transition. In May 2017, Muhtar Kent was succeeded as CEO by James Quincey, who will also take over the chairmanship from Mr. Kent immediately following this year's annual shareholder meeting.
We believe that having an independent chair will enhance rigorous oversight of management. We view the alternative of a lead outside director, even one with a robust set of duties, as inadequate. In this case, we find it particularly concerning that despite the company assuring investors of the important role played by the lead independent director. The position carries no additional director compensation. We are not convinced that the position suitably ensures the board's ability to provide leadership on critical issues facing the company, independently of management.

9 SHAREOWNER PROPOSALS   The Board's Statement in Opposition to Item 4
THE BOARD'S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO ITEM 4
The Board believes that leadership of both the Board and the Company by Mr. Quincey is the optimal structure to guide the Company and maintain the focus required to achieve its business goals.
In December 2018, Muhtar Kent announced his intention not to stand for reelection at the 2019 Annual Meeting and to retire as Chairman of the Board immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board has elected Mr. Quincey to succeed Mr. Kent as the 14th Chairman of the Board.
Assuming Mr. Quincey is reelected as a Director, the Board leadership structure effective following the 2019 Annual Meeting will be comprised of a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, a Lead Independent Director, Board committees led primarily by independent Directors and active engagement by all Directors. It is also relevant to note that all Directors play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at the Board and committee level. We believe this leadership structure provides an effective balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent Directors.
We believe that having one person serve the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer can provide certain synergies and efficiencies that enhance the functioning of the Board and, importantly, allow us to most effectively execute our role in overseeing business strategy.
The Company's business is complex, and its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Most of the Company's products are manufactured and sold by independent bottling partners throughout the world. The Chief Executive Officer maintains strong, hands-on relationships with leaders of the bottlers and remains close to the many facets of the business existing in so many places in the world. Because the Chief Executive Officer is the Board member closest to this vast and complex business, he or she is best able to identify many of the business issues that require Board attention, and as Chairman can best focus Directors' attention on the most critical business matters. Further, in the Board's experience, the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer allows for timely and unfiltered communication with the Board on these critical business issues. We also believe that there are benefits when the same person represents both the Company and the Board throughout the world with bottlers, customers, consumers and other stakeholders.
While our Board is satisfied that combining the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has served our shareowners well over time, it is important to note that if we believed that a different leadership structure was warranted based on the needs of the business, we would make a change. Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board retains the flexibility to make these kinds of changes, and we have made the change in certain circumstances. Further, this proposal seeks to permanently separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and we believe that a specifically defined approach that ties the Board's hands will not serve shareowners well over time.
The Board's full rationale for recommending this leadership structure can be found on page 27 in this Proxy Statement.

[END TABLE]
Whereas, more importantly, the most serious issues continue to be related to the public health and safety impacts of our Company's beverages, including syrups and sugary drinks, and the growing national health epidemic relating to increasing uses of sugar in our diet;
Whereas, our Company continues to be the target of multiple campaigns related to our Company's products that contribute to general level of decline in public health of consumers, including reports that 1 in 3 U.S. children born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes, resulting from poor diet, as increase in obesity in turn increases the risk of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancers, asthma, arthritis, reproductive complications and premature death;
Whereas, our Company continues to directly market sugary drinks with advertising directly influencing children's food preferences, diets and health;
Whereas, in 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement calling for a total ban on child targeted and interactive junk food advertising as a response to concerns regarding childhood obesity;
Whereas, public pressure against junk food and sugary drinks linked to obesity and diabetes, has led to numerous community campaigns to impose local taxes on sugary beverages, which include our products, to which our Company has responded by lobbying efforts in numerous state legislatures to preempt local control or restrict local taxation on our Company's products linked to obesity and diabetes;
Whereas, shareholders believe our Company should be part of the solution to solving the problem of the obesity epidemic in working with healthcare professionals and experts in diet and nutrition, not promoting advertising campaigns and funding Global Energy Balanced Network to shift the blame from poor diet causing obesity to lack of exercise;
Table of Contents
9 SHAREOWNER PROPOSALS   The Board's Statement in Opposition to Item 5
THE BOARD'S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO ITEM 5
This proposal requests that the Board issue a report focused on the topics of sugar and public health, with support from a group of independent and nationally recognized scientists and scholars.
However, the Access to Nutrition Foundation (the "ATNF"), a respected independent nonprofit organization, which is based in the Netherlands and is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, already produce reports covering our Company that encompass sugar and public health, and we believe address the essential objectives sought by the proposal.
The ATNF hosts the 'Access to Nutrition Index' and prominently addresses sugar in its reports, as this is the ATNF's key focus for our Company. Both the Global Indexes and the Spotlight Indexes released by the ATNF are intended to provide analysis and commentary on leading food and beverage manufacturers' efforts to improve consumers' access to nutritious foods and beverages. They were designed through an extensive, multi-stakeholder consultative process to ensure that they would be a useful tool for different stakeholder groups, including academia, civil society organizations, industry members and investors.
The Global Index was first released in 2013 and was updated in 2016 and 2018, each time with input from the Company, and assesses the Company's policies and products with regard to nutrition and sugar, in particular. Part of the value of the ATNF's findings in this report is that the Company now has a benchmark and improved awareness of where it stands compared to other manufacturers in the food and beverage industry. A link to the Global Index can be found here: https://www.accesstonutrition.org/global-index.
In November 2018, the ATNF released the U.S. Spotlight Index, a separate report on 10 leading food and beverage manufacturers' performance in the U.S. market as it relates to healthy product portfolios and corporate transparency to assist consumers in making healthy choices. A link to the Spotlight Index can be found here: https://www.accesstonutrition.org/us-spotlight-index.
We believe it is important that our shareowners know that our Company acknowledges the ATNF findings and recognizes the role it must play in addressing health challenges. This proposal, however, might lead the reader to believe that our Company is not a responsible player regarding this issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our Company fully understands that people should not eat or drink too much sugar. We are taking specific, meaningful actions, including reducing sugar in many of our products, to help people everywhere more easily control the consumption of added sugar.
We continue to make progress on sugar reduction in our beverages, in addition to expanding the portfolio of new drinks we offer to consumers such as tea, juice, water and coffee and providing smaller package sizes. In 2017, we reduced sugar in more than 300 of our drinks globally, while introducing more than 500 new products across a total beverage portfolio. We also have plans to reduce sugar in over 400 additional products. We have reduced the calorie content of our beverage portfolio by 21% within the last decade. Today we offer 260 products with less than 100 calories.
For the reasons stated above, we believe that producing a report as the proposal suggests would be a redundant exercise and divert Company resources.

ANNEX A - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
PROXY MATERIALS AND VOTING INFORMATION
Only shareowners of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on February 25, 2019, the record date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting or at any adjournments or postponements of the meeting.
Each owner of record on the record date is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by such shareowner. On February 25, 2019, there were 4,275,161,254 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.
The proxy materials for our 2019 Annual Meeting include the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and our Form 10-K. If you received a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or voting instruction form.
A proxy statement is a document that SEC regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy.
If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our officers as proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting. These three officers are James Quincey, John Murphy and Bernhard Goepelt.
The form of proxy and this Proxy Statement have been approved by the Board of Directors and are being provided to shareowners by the Board's authority.
We are furnishing proxy materials to our shareowners primarily via "Notice and Access" delivery pursuant to SEC rules. On March 7, 2019, we mailed to our shareowners (other than those who previously requested a printed set) a "Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials" (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials via the Internet. Utilizing this method of proxy delivery expedites receipt of proxy materials by our shareowners, reduces the cost of producing and mailing the full set of proxy materials and helps us contribute to sustainable practices.
If you receive a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access the proxy materials and vote over the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive paper copies of our proxy materials in the mail, you may follow the instructions in the Notice for making this request. The Notice also contains instructions on how you may request to receive an electronic copy of our proxy materials by e-mail.
If you received more than one Notice, proxy card or voting instruction form, you own shares registered in different names or own shares held in more than one account. To ensure that all shares are voted, please vote each account over the Internet or by telephone, or sign and return by mail all proxy cards and voting instruction forms. If you would like to consolidate your accounts, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), at (888) 265-3747 for assistance. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact them directly and request consolidation.
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered the "shareowner of record" with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares.

If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote.
Non-Discretionary Items. The election of Directors, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation and the two shareowner proposals are non-discretionary items and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners.
Discretionary Items. The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors is a discretionary item. Generally, banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal in their discretion.

11.   How can I vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting if I am a beneficial owner? 
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner and want to vote your shares at the 2019 Annual Meeting, you will need to ask your bank, broker or other nominee to furnish you with a legal proxy. You will need to follow the procedures described in the response to question 23 and then bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the meeting. You will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. If you do not have a legal proxy, you can still attend the meeting by following the procedures described in the response to question 23. However, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting. Accordingly, we encourage you to vote your shares in advance, even if you intend to attend the meeting.
Please note that if you request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked, and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf.

10 ANNEXES   Annex B - Summary of Plans
ANNEX B - SUMMARY OF PLANS
The following section provides information on Company-sponsored plans in 2018 in which the Named Executive Officers participated.
RETIREMENT PLANS – PENSION
TCCC Pension Plan. The TCCC Pension Plan is a broad-based tax-qualified defined benefit plan for substantially all U.S. employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries. A participant's benefit formula in the TCCC Pension Plan is dependent on when the participant was hired and whether they were employed by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ("CCE") before the Company's acquisition of CCE's North American operations in 2010. The information below summarizes the provisions applicable to employees, including the participating Named Executive Officers, who were hired by the Company or its subsidiaries prior to 2010. There are no special or enhanced pension plans for the Named Executive Officers.
Vesting. For employees hired prior to January 1, 2010, the benefit vests after completing three years of service or attaining age 60 with one year of service.
Benefit Formula. Prior to 2010, all pension benefits were based on a percentage of the employee's final average compensation (the five highest consecutive years out of the last 11) up to the limit for each year as set by the Tax Code, multiplied by the employee's years of credited service. Effective January 1, 2010, participants began accruing a pension benefit under a new cash balance formula (known as the Part B benefit). Participants employed as of December 31, 2009 retained the pension benefit they accrued under the prior benefit calculation formula through December 31, 2009 (known as the Part A benefit) and were eligible for one or more special transition benefits. As a result, beginning in 2010, a participant's benefit was potentially based on two formulas, Part A (prior benefit calculation formula) plus Part B (new cash balance formula). Under the cash balance formula, the Company makes an annual pay credit allocation to each active participant's account on December 31, ranging from 3% to 8% of compensation, based on the participant's age. In addition, on December 31 of each year, the Company makes an annual interest credit allocation based on the value of the participant's account as of January 1 of the same year. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2012 accrue a pension benefit based on a different cash balance formula than described above.
The term "compensation" for determining the pension benefit generally includes salary, overtime, commissions and cash incentive awards, but excludes any amounts related to stock options, performance cash awards, PSUs, restricted stock or restricted stock units. It also excludes deferred compensation and any extraordinary payments related to hiring or termination of employment.
Payment of Benefits. When benefits become payable upon separation from service, participants may choose between an annuity or a lump sum option. The TCCC Pension Plan provides for payment of a reduced benefit prior to normal retirement age and/or the current cash balance amount, as applicable.
Limitations on Benefits. In 2018, a participant could receive no more than $220,000 annually from the TCCC Pension Plan and no compensation in excess of $275,000 for the year could be taken into account for calculating benefits under the TCCC Pension Plan.
TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan. Supplemental pension plans make employees whole when the Tax Code limits the benefit that otherwise would accrue under the applicable pension plan. The TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan also operates to keep employees whole when they defer part of their salary or annual incentive under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Otherwise, electing to defer would reduce an employee's pension benefits.
Vesting. Vesting and benefits under the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan are calculated generally in the same manner as if the participant's otherwise eligible compensation or full annual benefit were able to be paid from the TCCC Pension Plan.
Payment of Benefits. Benefits become payable upon separation from service. The form of payment is dictated by the terms of the plan and the participant's age and years of service at the time of separation. The cash balance portion of the TCCC Supplemental Pension Plan is paid as a lump sum. The traditional pension benefit portion is paid as an annuity if the participant separates on or after the earliest retirement date (generally, age 55 with ten years of service). Otherwise, the traditional pension benefit portion is paid as a lump sum.
Mobile Plan. The Mobile Plan provides a retirement benefit to globally mobile associates. The Mobile Plan applies on the same terms to the general population of international service associates worldwide. Under the Mobile Plan, a globally mobile associate's account is credited with a monthly percentage of pay ("pay credit") and a defined rate of return ("interest credit"). The pay credit is generally 10% of pay, less any benefits provided by local retirement plans. Both pay credits and interest credits are immediately vested. A participant will continue to receive monthly interest credits for as long as participation in the plan continues, even if the associate is no longer on a global assignment. International service associates who participated in certain other plans were transitioned to the Mobile Plan as of December 31, 2011. Benefits accrued under such other plans were converted to an opening balance in the Mobile Plan as part of the transition.

Annex B - Summary of Plans   ANNEXES 10
RETIREMENT PLANS – 401(K) AND SAVINGS PLANS
401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is a broad-based tax-qualified defined contribution plan for most U.S. employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries. The Company matches participant contributions up to a maximum of 3.5% of the participant's compensation or the amount allowable under the limits imposed under the Tax Code, whichever is lower. The Company's matching contribution is initially invested in Common Stock, but participants may move the contribution to any other available investment option. Employees become 100% vested in Company matching contributions after two years. For 2018, compensation over $275,000 could not be taken into account under the 401(k) Plan.
Supplemental 401(k) Plan. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan makes employees whole when the Tax Code limits the Company matching contributions that otherwise would be credited to them under the 401(k) Plan. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan also operates to keep employees whole when they defer part of their salary or annual incentive under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company credits the employee with the Company matching contributions in hypothetical share units of Common Stock. The value of the accumulated share units, including dividend equivalents, is paid in cash after separation from service. Participants are immediately vested in their contributions. Employees are not permitted to make contributions to the Supplemental 401(k) Plan.
UK Savings Plan. The UK Savings Plan is a broad-based registered defined contribution plan in which the majority of employees in the UK participate. Plan participants must contribute a minimum of 2% of pensionable salary on which the Company contributes 2.5 times the employee's contribution up to a maximum Company contribution of 15% of the participant's pensionable salary. There are no limits to the amount of contributions that employees can make to their pension account; however, tax effectiveness of contributions is limited by both a lifetime allowance as well as an annual allowance. These amounts have changed frequently over recent years and continue to be subject to change. For the 2017/2018 tax year, the annual allowance was up to £40,000 and the lifetime allowance was £1 million. Generally, under the plan, normal retirement age is 65 and benefits may not be drawn before age 55.
INCENTIVE PLANS
Annual Incentive Plan. The Company maintains the Performance Incentive Plan for employees above a specified job grade level. The Performance Incentive Plan provides an annual cash payment based on predetermined performance measures. The Compensation Committee may designate one or more performance measures from the list contained in the plan. Annual incentive ranges are established for each participant. Payments are generally made in March in the year following the applicable performance year. No participant may receive an annual payment greater than $10 million. The Performance Incentive Plan was designed to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Tax Code, but because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing Section 162(m)'s exemption from the deduction limit, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) in fact will be deductible under the legislation's grandfather rules. See page 53 for additional information about the Performance Incentive Plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plans. The Company maintains long-term incentive plans for employees above a specified grade level. The following types of awards may be granted under the plans, as designated by the Compensation Committee: (i) stock options; (ii) PSUs; (iii) restricted stock and restricted stock units; (iv) other performance awards, including performance-based awards, payable in cash or Common Stock; (v) stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); and (vi) other stock-based awards. The Company currently has outstanding awards of stock options, PSUs, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance cash awards, which are described below. See page 55 for additional information about long-term incentive compensation.
Stock Options. Stock options give the holder the right to purchase shares of Common Stock at a specified price during specified time periods. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of Common Stock on the grant date. The fair market value is the average of the high and low prices of Common Stock on the grant date. In certain foreign jurisdictions, the law requires additional restrictions on the calculation of the option price. The grants provide that stock options generally may not be exercised during the first 12 months after the grant date. Generally, options vest 25% on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a term of ten years. The Company's current compensation programs include stock options as part of the annual long-term equity compensation awards made to eligible employees.
Performance Share Units. PSUs provide an opportunity for employees to receive Common Stock if predetermined performance measures are met for a predefined performance period. PSUs generally are subject to an additional holding period. The Company's current compensation programs include PSUs as part of the annual long-term equity compensation awards made to eligible employees.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards may be performance-based or time-based. Shares of stock are granted and transferred into the employee's name. Shares remain subject to forfeiture until the shares are released under the terms of the awards. Restricted stock unit awards may be performance-based or time-based and are settled in stock when all required criteria are met. Employees do not receive any dividend equivalents on restricted stock units during the term. The Company's current compensation programs include restricted stock units as part of the annual long-term equity compensation awards made to eligible employees.
Table of Contents
10 ANNEXES   Annex B - Summary of Plans
Performance Cash Awards. Performance cash awards are used in countries where it is difficult to grant equity. Employees who receive performance cash awards do not receive equity awards as part of the annual long-term incentive program. No Named Executive Officers received performance cash awards.
Other Awards. While the 2014 Equity Plan provides the Compensation Committee discretion to grant different types of equity awards, including SARs and other stock-based awards such as unrestricted shares, no such awards have been or are expected to be granted.
OTHER PLANS
Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan is a nonqualified and unfunded deferred compensation program offered to approximately 500 U.S.-based Company employees in 2018. International service associates do not participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Eligible participants may defer up to 80% of base salary and up to 95% of their annual incentive. The Company has the benefit of full unrestricted use of all amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan until such amounts are required to be distributed to the plan participants. Gains and losses are credited based on the participant's election of a variety of deemed investment choices. The Company does not match any employee deferral or guarantee a return. Participants' accounts may or may not appreciate and may depreciate depending on the performance of their deemed investment choices. None of the deemed investment choices provide returns at above-market or preferential rates. All deferrals are paid out in cash upon distribution. Participants may schedule a distribution during employment or may opt to receive their balance after separation from service. Participants who are considered "specified employees" under Section 409A of the Tax Code (generally, the top 50 highest paid executives) may not receive a post-termination distribution for at least six months following separation. On occasion, the Company may provide a one-time credit to the Deferred Compensation Plan to make up for benefits lost under various circumstances, such as benefits lost at a prior employer. The Company has not provided any such credits for any of the Named Executive Officers.
International Service Programs. International service program benefits generally include relocation expenses, a housing allowance (including certain housing expenses), a cost of living adjustment (a cash adjustment designed to provide equivalent purchasing power), certain cash allowances recognizing differences in living conditions in the host location, a home leave allowance and currency protection. The programs also provide tax preparation services and tax equalization, where applicable. There were approximately 500 participants in these programs in 2018.
TCCC Severance Plan. The TCCC Severance Plan provides cash severance benefits to eligible employees who are involuntarily terminated. Eligible employees include regular, non-union, non-manufacturing U.S. employees and international service associates. Generally, benefits are payable when an employee is terminated involuntarily due to certain circumstances such as an internal reorganization or position elimination. Benefits are not payable if the employee is offered a comparable position with the Company or one of its affiliates, is terminated for cause or has entered into a separate agreement. The benefit payable is determined based on job grade level, salary and/or length of service. The minimum benefit is eight weeks of base pay and the maximum benefit is two years of base pay.

ANNEX C - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP" or referred to herein as "reported"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
For additional details regarding the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019. This information is also available in the "Investors" section of the Company's website, www.coca-colacompany.com.
