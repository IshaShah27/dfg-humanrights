S&P Global Inc. Proxy Statement 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
GENERAL INFORMATION
Why did I receive this Proxy Statement?
The Board of Directors of S&P Global Inc. (the "Company," "we" or "us") is soliciting proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041, at 11:00 a.m. (EDT) and at any postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. When the Company asks for your proxy, we must provide you with a Proxy Statement that contains certain information specified by law. This Proxy Statement summarizes the information you need in order to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Why have I received a Notice Regarding Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of printed copies of these materials in the mail?
In accordance with rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we have elected to furnish our proxy materials to shareholders over the Internet. Most shareholders are receiving by mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice"), which provides general information about the Annual Meeting, the address of the website on which our proxy statement and annual report are available for review, printing and downloading and instructions on how to submit proxy votes. For those who wish to receive their materials in a different format (e.g., paper copy by mail), or be notified of their availability online by e-mail, the Notice contains instructions on how to do so. Shareholders who have previously consented to electronic delivery will receive an e-mail with a web address to view the proxy statement and annual report online, along with instructions on how to vote. 
What will I vote on?
The following items: 
1.
election of 12 Directors; 
​
2.
approval, on an advisory basis, of the executive compensation program for the Company's named executive officers, as described in this Proxy Statement; 
​
3.
approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan; 
​
4.
approval of the Company's Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as Amended and Restated; 
​
5.
ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019; and 
​
6.
other matters that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting. 
​
Will there be any other items of business on the agenda?
We do not expect any other items of business at the Annual Meeting. Nonetheless, if there is an unforeseen need, your proxy will give discretionary authority to the persons named on the proxy to vote on any other matters that may be properly brought before the Annual Meeting. These persons will use their best judgment in voting your proxy. 
Who can vote?
Shareholders as of the close of business on the record date, which is March 18, 2019, may vote at the Annual Meeting. 
       2019 Proxy Statement       1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
GENERAL INFORMATION (continued)
​
How many votes do I have?
You have one vote at the Annual Meeting for each share of common stock you held on the record date. 
What does it mean to be a "shareholder of record"?
If, as of the close of business on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy. The Company is incorporated in New York and, in accordance with New York law, a list of the Company's common shareholders of record as of the record date will be available for inspection at the Annual Meeting upon request.
What does it mean to beneficially own shares in "street name"?
If, as of the close of business on the record date, your shares were not held directly in your name but rather were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank or similar intermediary organization, then you are the beneficial holder of shares held in "street name." The intermediary is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct the intermediary how to vote the shares held in your account. 
How do I vote my shares of Company common stock?
If you are a shareholder of record, you can vote in the following ways: 
 By Internet. Follow the Internet voting instructions included on the Notice or proxy card you received. You may vote at any time up until 11:00 a.m. (EDT) on May 9, 2019. 
 By Telephone. Follow the telephone voting instructions included on the proxy card you received. You may vote at any time up until 11:00 a.m. (EDT) on May 9, 2019. 
 By Mail. If you received a printed copy of the proxy materials from us by mail, you may vote by mail by marking, dating and signing your proxy card in accordance with the instructions on it and returning it by mail in the pre-addressed reply envelope provided with the proxy materials. The proxy card must be received prior to the Annual Meeting. 
 In Person. You may vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. The Company will give you a ballot at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by Internet, telephone or mail so that your vote will be counted in the event you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner, you can vote in the following ways: 
 As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on how to vote the shares in your account. Your broker should give you instructions for voting your shares by Internet, telephone or mail. As a beneficial owner, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, but you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker giving you the legal right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. 
How will my shares be voted if I do not give specific voting instructions when I deliver my proxy?
Shareholders of Record 
If you are a shareholder of record and you return a signed proxy card without indicating your vote for some or all of the matters, your shares will be voted as follows for any matter you did not vote on: 
 "FOR" the 12 nominees to the Board;
 "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of the executive compensation program for the Company's named executive officers;
 "FOR" approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan;
 "FOR" approval of the Company's Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as Amended and Restated; and 
 "FOR" the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
GENERAL INFORMATION (continued)​
​
Beneficial Owners 
As noted above, as the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, your broker is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give instructions, one of two things can happen depending on whether the proposal is considered "routine" or "non-routine" under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"): 
 If the proposal is considered "routine" under the rules of the NYSE, the broker may vote your shares in its discretion. 
 If the proposal is considered "non-routine" under the rules of the NYSE, the broker may not vote your shares without your instructions. When a broker refrains from voting your shares because the broker has not received your instructions, it is called a "broker non-vote." 
Item 5 in this Proxy Statement (ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019) will be considered routine under the rules of the NYSE and the broker may vote your shares for this Item in its discretion. The broker is not entitled to vote your shares on the other Items unless the broker has received instructions from you. 
What should I do if I want to attend the Annual Meeting?
Only shareholders (of record or beneficial) and their proxy holders may attend the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a shareholder of record and receive your proxy materials by mail, you will find an admission ticket attached as part of the proxy card or Notice sent to you. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please bring your admission ticket with you to the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record and receive your materials electronically, and vote via the Internet, please print out the admission ticket you can generate from the online voting system. 
If your shares are held in street name (i.e., you are a beneficial owner), you must bring to the Annual Meeting an account statement or letter from the broker, bank, trustee or other intermediary organization that holds your shares indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares on March 18, 2019. 
When you arrive at the Annual Meeting, you may be asked to present photo identification, such as a driver's license, to be admitted. S&P Global Inc. employees wishing to attend the Annual Meeting can present their current employee identification card to be admitted. 
For safety and security reasons, no cameras, large bags, briefcases, packages, recording equipment or other electronic devices will be permitted in the Annual Meeting. 
Whether you hold shares as a shareholder of record or are a beneficial owner, we urge you to vote in advance by Internet, telephone or mail so that your vote will be counted in the event you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote my shares in the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan?
If you participate in the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, any proxy you give will also govern the voting of all shares you hold in this Plan. 
How do I vote my shares in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
If you participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, any proxy you give will also govern the voting of any shares you hold in this Plan. Any Plan shares for which we do not receive instructions from the employee will not be voted. Plan shares cannot be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote my shares in the Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plans?
If you received this Proxy Statement because you are an employee of the Company who participates in one of the Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plans and you have shares of common stock of the Company allocated to your account under one of these Plans, you may vote your shares held in these Plans as of March 18, 2019 by mail, by telephone or via the Internet. Instructions are provided on the proxy card you received from Computershare. Computershare must receive your instructions by 2:00 p.m. (EDT) on May 7, 
       2019 Proxy Statement       3

​
2019 in order to communicate your instructions to the Plans' Trustee, who will vote your shares. Any Plan shares for which we do not receive instructions from the employee will be voted by the Trustee in the same proportion as the shares for which we have received instructions. Plan shares cannot be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Can I revoke or change my vote?
Yes. If you are a shareholder of record, you have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the Annual Meeting by sending a signed notice to the Corporate Secretary, c/o Office of the General Counsel, S&P Global Inc., 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003 or by sending an e-mail to the Corporate Secretary at corporate.secretary@spglobal.com. 
If you want to change your vote before the Annual Meeting, you must deliver a later dated proxy by telephone, via the Internet or in writing. You may also change your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the information forwarded by your broker for procedures on revoking or changing your proxy. 
What are the requirements to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?
In order to conduct business at the Annual Meeting, we must have a quorum. This means at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must be present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. You are part of the quorum if you have voted by proxy. As of the record date, 246,081,283 shares of Company common stock were outstanding and eligible to vote. 
Are abstentions and broker non-votes part of the quorum?
Yes. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as "shares present" at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. 
What are the costs of soliciting these proxies and who will pay them?
The Company will pay all costs of soliciting these proxies. In addition, some of our officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone or in person without additional compensation. We will reimburse brokers for the expenses they incur in forwarding the proxy materials to you. The Company has also retained Georgeson LLC to assist us with the solicitation of proxies for a fee not to exceed $19,000, plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. 
How many votes are required for the approval of each Item?
 Item One – A nominee will be elected as a Director if he or she receives a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a Director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that Director's election. If an incumbent Director who has been nominated for re-election fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, New York law provides that the Director continues to serve as a Director in a hold-over capacity. The Company's By-Laws provide that, in such circumstances, the Director is required to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is then required to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. The Board will act on the tendered resignation and will publicly disclose its decision and rationale within 90 days following certification of the election results. If a Director's resignation is accepted by the Board, the Board may fill the vacancy or decrease the size of the Board. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted either for or against the election of a Director nominee. 
 Item Two – The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the executive compensation program for the Company's named executive officers, as described in this Proxy Statement. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted either for or against this proposal.

​

Who will count the vote?

How do I submit a shareholder proposal for the 2020 Annual Meeting?
There are three different deadlines for submitting different forms of shareholder proposals. First, if a shareholder wishes to have a proposal considered for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement, he or she must submit the proposal in writing so that we receive it by November 20, 2019. Proposals should be addressed to the Corporate Secretary, c/o Office of the General Counsel, S&P Global Inc., 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003 or by sending an e-mail to the Corporate Secretary at corporate.secretary@spglobal.com. If you submit a proposal, it must comply with applicable laws, including Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to be included. 
On January 27, 2016, we amended our By-Laws to include a proxy access provision. The Company's By-Laws now permit a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning continuously for at least three years shares of common stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of our outstanding shares, to nominate and include in next year's Proxy Statement director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Company's Board of Directors, whichever is greater, provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the Company's By-Laws. Notice of proxy access director nominees must be received no earlier than October 21, 2019, and no later than November 20, 2019. 
In addition, the Company's By-Laws provide that any shareholder wishing to nominate a candidate for Director or to propose any other business at the Annual Meeting, but not intending to have such nomination or business included in next year's Proxy Statement, must give the Company written notice no earlier than January 10, 2020 and no later than February 9, 2020. This notice must comply with applicable laws and the Company's By-Laws. Copies of the By-Laws are available to shareholders free of charge on request to the Corporate Secretary, c/o Office of the General Counsel, S&P Global Inc., 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003 or by sending an e-mail to the Corporate Secretary at corporate.secretary@spglobal.com. You may also download the By-Laws from the Corporate Governance section of the Company's Investor Relations website at http://investor.spglobal.com. 
May I view future proxy materials online instead of receiving them by mail?
Yes. Shareholders may provide their consent to electronic delivery of Proxy Statements and Annual Reports instead of receiving them by postal mail. If you elect this feature, you will receive an e-mail notice, which will include the web address for viewing the materials online. The e-mail notice will also include instructions so you can vote your proxy online or by telephone. If you have more than one account, you may receive separate e-mails for each account. Costs normally associated with electronic delivery, such as charges from your Internet service provider, as well as any costs incurred in printing documents, will be your responsibility. 
During the 2019 proxy voting period, the Internet voting systems will automatically provide shareholders the option to consent to electronic delivery of future years' materials.

GENERAL INFORMATION (continued)
​
During the year, shareholders may provide their consent to electronic delivery by going to the appropriate website: 
 Shareholders of record go to www.computershare.com/investor 
 Beneficial owners go to https://enroll.icsdelivery.com/spgi 
 Owners of shares through one of the Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plans go to www.spglobalbenefits.com 
What are the benefits of electronic delivery?
Electronic delivery benefits the environment and saves the Company money by reducing printing and mailing costs. It will also make it convenient for you to view your proxy materials and vote your shares online. If you have shares in more than one account, it is also an easy way to eliminate receiving duplicate copies of proxy materials. 
What are the costs of electronic delivery?
The Company charges nothing for electronic delivery. You may, of course, incur expenses associated with Internet access, such as charges from your Internet service provider. 
How do I opt-out of electronic delivery?
At any time, shareholders may revoke their consent to electronic delivery and resume postal mail delivery of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report by going to the appropriate website: 
 Shareholders of record go to www.computershare.com/investor 
 Beneficial owners go to https://enroll.icsdelivery.com/spgi 
 Owners of shares through one of the Company's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plans go to www.spglobalbenefits.com 
What is "householding"?
We have adopted "householding," a procedure under which beneficial owners who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of our Annual Report and Proxy Statement unless one or more of these shareholders notifies us that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure reduces duplicate mailings and thus reduces our printing costs and postage fees. 
Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Householding does not affect dividend check mailings. 
How do I request a separate paper or e-mail copy of the Proxy Statement or Annual Report at no charge?
If you wish to receive a separate paper or e-mail copy of the 2018 Annual Report or this Proxy Statement at no charge, please call us toll-free at (866) 436-8502, or send an e-mail to investor.relations@spglobal.com, or write to: Investor Relations, S&P Global Inc., 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003. We will promptly deliver to you the documents you requested. Please make your request for documents on or before April 25, 2019 to facilitate timely delivery of the documents to you prior to the Annual Meeting. 
Where can I find the voting results?
We expect to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will also publish voting results in a Form 8-K, which we will file with the SEC on or before May 15, 2019.

Enhanced Corporate Governance Environment
The Board of Directors has taken a series of actions designed to enhance the Company's corporate governance environment. The Company's current corporate governance structure reflects an ongoing commitment to strong and effective governance practices and a willingness to be responsive and accountable to shareholders. We regularly assess and refine our corporate governance policies and procedures to take into account evolving best practices and the interest of our shareholders. Our corporate governance structure includes: 
Board Structure and Independence
✔
Board Independence. All of the Company's director nominees are independent, with the exception of our CEO, who is the only member of management serving on the Board. 
​
✔
Independent Chairman. The Company currently maintains separate roles of chief executive officer and chairman of the Board. An independent director acts as chairman of the Board. In the future, if the chairman is not an independent director, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that an independent director be designated as presiding director. 
​
✔
Independent Committee Chairs. Each of the Committees of the Board is led by an independent director. 
​
✔
Executive Sessions. The independent directors of the Board meet in executive session led by the independent chairman of the Board at every regularly scheduled Board meeting. 
​
Board Diversity and Refreshment
✔
Board Membership. Since 2016, we have added five new independent directors who have brought valuable and varied experience in distinct and critical areas, each providing a fresh perspective to our Board. Their appointments underscore the Company's commitment to inviting diverse backgrounds, perspectives, skills and experience into the boardroom to guide the growth and performance of the Company. 
​
✔
Board Skills. Throughout 2016 and again in 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the skills and qualifications of the Board, and the critical skills necessary to guide the Company forward. In 2016 and 2017, we added important skills to our Board in the areas of technology, international operations and commodity markets. We are also recommending a new Director nominee for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting who will bring further expertise in technology, international operations and executive leadership. 
​
✔
Diversity. We believe that diversity is an important attribute of a well-functioning Board. While diversity can be measured in many ways, we note that our 12 Director nominees include 4 women and 2 African-Americans. 
​
✔
Offer to Resign upon Change in Circumstances. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, any director undergoing a significant change in personal or professional circumstances must offer to resign from the Board. 
​
✔
Overboarding Policy. In 2018, we amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines to limit the number of public  company boards on which our Directors may serve to 3 total boards for public company executive officers and 5 total public  company boards for other directors, unless the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines such outside board service would not impair the Director's service to the Company. 
​
✔
Retirement Age. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors cannot stand for re-election after reaching the age 72. 
​
✔
Board Tenure. Since 2011, we have reduced the average tenure of our Board from 11.3 years to 6.5 years.

Election of Directors/Accountability to Shareholders
✔
Annual Election of Directors. The Company's charter provides for the annual election of directors. 
​
✔
Majority Voting in Director Elections. The Company's By-Laws provide that in uncontested elections, director candidates must be elected by a majority of the votes cast. In uncontested director elections, a director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast must offer to submit his or her resignation for consideration. 
​
✔
Shareholder Right to Call Special Meetings. The Company's By-Laws allow shareholders of record of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock to call a special meeting. 
​
✔
Annual Self-Evaluation. The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation of Board and Committee performance and each Director's performance, as well as an evaluation of the Chairman of the Board and each Committee Chair, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reports the results to the Board, including its assessment of the Board's and the Committees' effectiveness and areas for improvement. 
​
Shareholder Recommendations/Proxy Access
✔
Shareholder Recommendations. Shareholders can submit recommendations of director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
​
✔
Proxy Access. A shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning continuously for at least three years shares of common stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of our outstanding shares, may nominate and include in the Company's Proxy Statement director nominees constituting up to two individuals or twenty percent (20%) of the Company's Board of Directors, whichever is greater. 
​
Management Succession Planning
✔
Succession Planning. The Board believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to oversee the development and retention of executive talent and to ensure that an appropriate succession plan is in place for our Chief Executive Officer and other members of management. Based on feedback from the Board's recent self-evaluations, greater focus has been brought to bear on the development of succession planning, including emergency Chief Executive Officer succession planning, at the Board and Committee level. Additional information can be found on pages 19 and 20 of this Proxy Statement. 
​
✔
Board Talent Agenda. In 2018, the full Board reviewed specific talent management topics as standing agenda items at four out of seven of its scheduled meetings. 
​
Compensation Practices
✔
"Double-Trigger" Condition for Vesting of Equity-Based Awards upon a Change-in-Control. Awards granted under the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to "double-trigger" treatment in the case of a change-in-control. Additional information can be found in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, beginning on page 50 of this Proxy Statement. 
​
✔
Pay Recovery Policy. The Company may recover (or "clawback") cash incentive and long-term incentive award payments received by covered active and former employees and executives under various circumstances, including misconduct and financial restatements, under the applicable Company policy and S&P Global Ratings policy. Additional information can be found beginning on page 82 of this Proxy Statement. 
​
Equity Ownership Requirements
✔
Senior Executive Equity Ownership Requirements. The Company maintains equity ownership standards requiring senior management to hold shares or stock units of our common stock with a value equal to a multiple of base salary. Unless the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee determines that a financial hardship exception applies, until the guidelines for ownership levels are attained, senior executives must retain one-hundred percent (100%) of the net shares received (after payment of taxes

Each Director is required to hold 400 shares of the Company's common stock within 90 days of his or her election to the Board and to hold such shares through his or her tenure as a Director. Additionally, under the Company's Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines, each non-employee Director is required to own or acquire, within five years of election to the Company's Board of Directors, shares of common stock of the Company having a market value of at least five times the annual cash retainer for serving as a Director of the Company. Additional information can be found on page 106  of this Proxy Statement. 
​
✔
Policy Prohibiting Hedging and Pledging. The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits the hedging and pledging of Company stock by executive officers, other designated employees and directors without exception.
​
Corporate Governance Materials
The following corporate governance materials are available and can be viewed and downloaded from the Corporate Governance section of the Company's Investor Relations website at http://investor.spglobal.com: 
 the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; 
 the Company's By-Laws; 
 the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines; 
 Board Committee Charters for the Company's Audit, Compensation and Leadership Development, Executive, Financial Policy and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees; 
 the Code of Business Ethics applicable to all Company employees; 
 the Code of Ethics applicable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers; 
 the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors applicable to all the Company's Directors; and 
 the Audit Committee's Policy concerning Employee Complaint Procedures Regarding Accounting and Auditing Matters.
Director Independence
The Board has determined that all of the Company's current Directors, with the exception of Mr. Douglas L. Peterson (the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer), have met the independence requirements of the NYSE based upon the application of objective categorical standards adopted by the Board. To be considered independent, a Director must have no material relationship (other than as a Director) with the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a material relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In making independence determinations, the Board broadly considers all relevant facts and circumstances. 
In addition, members of the Audit Committee must also satisfy the SEC and NYSE independence requirements, which provide that they may not be affiliates and may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than their directors' compensation. The Board evaluated each member of the Compensation Committee under the additional SEC and NYSE compensation committee member standards and also determined that these members qualify as "non-employee directors" (as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
Additional Information Regarding Director Independence
In making its independence determinations with respect to our Directors, the Board considered the following transactions that the Company engages in from time to time with organizations in which our independent Directors serve as executive officers or otherwise have a material interest:

 Avnet, Inc. Mr. William J. Amelio is the Chief Executive Officer at Avnet, Inc. In 2018, the Company and its divisions provided Avnet, Inc. the following products and services: data subscriptions and credit rating services.
 Cisco Systems, Inc. Ms. Rebecca Jacoby served as the Senior Vice President of Operations at Cisco Systems, Inc. until her retirement in January 2018, after a 22-year career at Cisco Systems, Inc., and continued to provide advisory services to Cisco Systems, Inc. through May 2018. In 2018, Cisco Systems, Inc. provided the Company and its divisions with network and telecommunications equipment and services. In 2018, the Company and its divisions provided Cisco Systems, Inc. the following products and services: data subscriptions, licensing of publications and credit rating services. 
 Lockheed Martin Corporation. Ms. Stephanie C. Hill is the Deputy Executive Vice President, Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) at Lockheed Martin Corporation. In 2018, the Company and its divisions provided Lockheed Martin Corporation the following products and services: data subscriptions and licensing of publications, credit rating services and index services. 
 Snam S.p.A. Mr. Marco Alverà is the Chief Executive Officer of Snam S.p.A. In 2018, the Company and its divisions provided Snam S.p.A. the following types of products and services: credit rating services. 
All of these transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of business and on terms that are substantially equivalent to those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other similarly situated customers or vendors of the Company. None of the transactions described above exceeds 1% of the Company's consolidated revenue or that of such other company. 
In making its independence determinations with respect to our Directors, the Board reviews the materiality of these transactions not only from the standpoint of the applicable Director but also from the standpoint of the organizations in which they serve. Based on this review, the Board has concluded that these transactions do not interfere with the ability of each such Director to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her Board responsibilities. 
Annual Meeting Attendance
It is the Company's policy that, subject to illness or an unavoidable schedule conflict, all Directors will attend and be introduced at the Annual Meeting. All of our Directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting, other than Mr. Kurt Schmoke due to an unavoidable pre-existing commitment. 
Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board shall select annually the Chairman of the Board based upon such criteria as the Company's independent Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends and what the Directors believe to be in the best interests of the Company at a given point in time. This process shall include consideration of whether the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be combined or separated based upon the Company's needs and the strengths and talents of its executives at any given time. 
Although the Board regularly considers and is open to different structures as circumstances may warrant, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders at this time that the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer be held by separate individuals. The Board believes that this leadership structure will continue to assure the appropriate level of management oversight and independence for the Company. In the future, if the Chairman is not an independent director, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that an independent director be designated as presiding director to lead the executive sessions of the independent directors at Board meetings, consult on committee selection, and communicate the annual

evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer, together with the Chairman of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee. In addition, each of the Committees of the Board is led by an independent Director acting as the Committee chair. 
Mr. Charles E. Haldeman is currently the Board's independent chairman. The only member of management who serves on the Board is Mr. Douglas L. Peterson, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. The position of chairman of the Board has been held by an independent director since 2015. The Board will continue to periodically evaluate whether the structure is in the best interests of shareholders.

Executive Sessions
In response to feedback from the 2016 Board and Committee self-evaluation, executive sessions of our independent directors are held at both the beginning and end of every regularly scheduled Board meeting as well as whenever deemed appropriate by the Board. Each session is chaired by the independent Chairman of the Board who may, at his discretion, invite the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, other employees and independent outside advisors or guests to participate as appropriate.
Shareholder Engagement
We value our shareholders' feedback and are committed to engaging in constructive and meaningful dialogue with shareholders regarding our governance practices, executive compensation program and other areas of shareholder focus throughout the year, including the Board's oversight of risk, strategy and talent. Maintaining an ongoing and active dialogue with shareholders is critical to the development of a sound governance process that promotes transparency, accountability and long-term shareholder value by: 
 Providing our investors with visibility into our business strategy, governance practices and compensation programs; 
 Helping us determine which issues are important to shareholders in order to share and exchange our views on those issues; and 
 Offering us an opportunity to identify emerging issues that could impact our business and influence our practices.

How We Engage
A shareholder engagement team consisting of senior management, Investor Relations and the Corporate Secretary leads our outreach initiatives, seeking input from our shareholders in a number of forums year-round, including proactive off-season outreach to institutional investors and targeted proxy-season outreach, as appropriate, on specific areas of investor focus. 
Investor Relations Activities
As part of our ongoing Investor Relations outreach, members of senior management and Investor Relations routinely engage with institutional investors by participating in industry conferences, non-deal roadshows and one-on-one meetings. In 2018, the Investor Relations team continued our active dialogue with investors by attending 14 investor conferences, visiting investors in 36 cities and in total conducting over 1,000 investor meetings, as well as holding an investor day to discuss our integrated operating model and long-term strategy to Power the Markets of the Future announced at the beginning of the year. These activities allow our senior management and Investor Relations team to share and discuss our business strategy and achievements, solicit investor feedback on our performance and seek insight into our investors' priorities throughout the year. 
Corporate Secretary Outreach
We also conduct proactive annual outreach by inviting governance representatives of our largest institutional shareholders to discuss corporate governance, compensation, environmental and social and other matters with the Corporate Secretary both during and outside of the proxy season. 
As part of our annual off-season outreach conducted during the fall and winter of 2018-2019, we invited our largest long-term institutional investors, collectively representing 38% of our shares outstanding, to discuss general corporate governance, corporate responsibility and executive compensation matters and provide feedback. 
Last spring, we engaged in targeted proxy-season outreach with our top 51 institutional investors, collectively representing 59% of our shares outstanding, to discuss important governance items for consideration at the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Communicating Shareholder Feedback
The shareholder engagement team regularly reports to the full Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and any other committees, as necessary, on the Company's outreach activities, shareholder feedback and recommended best practices. 
Our proxy-season and off-season engagement initiatives from 2018 to 2019 covered a wide range of important governance topics, providing valuable insights and feedback regarding the following areas of investor focus:

​
Board Review and Responsiveness
The Board and its relevant committees consider our shareholders' views and perspectives as part of their decision-making process on key issues related to strategy, governance, compensation and environmental and social responsibility to integrate shareholder input and emerging best practice into our governance process. 
In 2018, we implemented the following governance enhancements in response to investor input gathered through our shareholder engagement efforts: 
 Amended Corporate Governance Guidelines to include overboarding policy limiting the number of public  company boards on which our directors may serve (up to three total boards for public company executive officers; five total public company boards for other directors, unless the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines such outside board service would not impair the director's service to the Company). 
 Enhanced corporate governance disclosure, including in the areas of risk oversight, Board composition, refreshment and succession planning, Board self-evaluations and shareholder engagement and environmental and social responsibility. 
 Provided supplemental pay ratio disclosure to help investors contextualize the ratio of our CEO to median employee pay in light of our workforce distribution and pay philosophy. 
In addition, many of the improvements to our governance and compensation structures implemented over the last several years have been informed by shareholder feedback. Examples of prior governance and compensation program changes made in response to shareholder feedback are highlighted on page 62 of this Proxy Statement and affirm our responsiveness to and alignment with our shareholders. 
Contacting the Board
We believe communication between the Board and the Company's shareholders is an important part of the governance process. Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with our Board or any director or committee by addressing communications to the Corporate Secretary, c/o Office of the General Counsel, S&P Global Inc., 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003. 
The Corporate Secretary may sort or summarize the communications as appropriate and, depending on the nature of the communication, the correspondence will either be forwarded or periodically presented to the Board.

Role of Board of Directors in Risk Oversight
The Board is broadly responsible for overseeing and evaluating the management of the Company, including the development and implementation of the Company's strategic objectives, and provides direction to management in the interest of and for the benefit of the Company's shareholders. In connection with the Board's important role in overseeing the Company's strategic direction for the benefit of shareholders, the Board oversees risk management in order to align with the Company's strategy, including through its oversight of the key strategic and competitive, financial, operational, legal, regulatory, compliance, technology, cybersecurity, talent and culture risks. The Board believes that effective risk management, combined with prudent risk acceptance in pursuit of the Company's strategic objectives, is essential to the Company's commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value and Power the Markets of the Future. 
Role of Board and Its Committees
The Board has oversight responsibility for the Company's risk management framework, which is designed to identify, measure, assess, mitigate, monitor and report risks across the Company. In overseeing the Company's risk management framework, the Board strives to ensure that the Company's overall risk exposure is appropriately aligned with the Company's strategy and agreed risk tolerances, focusing on the most significant

​
strategic and competitive, financial, operational, legal, regulatory, compliance, technology, cybersecurity, third-party, talent management and culture risks facing the Company. 
The Board exercises its risk oversight responsibilities both directly and indirectly through the Board's Committees by delegating oversight for specific categories of risk to its Committees, which assist the Board in evaluating the key risks faced by the Company and assessing the Company's policies as they relate to risk management. 
Role of Management
While the Board provides oversight, management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company's risk exposures in a manner consistent with the strategic direction and objectives established by the Board. Management provides regular updates to the Board and the Audit Committee concerning strategic, operational and emerging risks and the Company's efforts to mitigate those risks. As a critical component of the Company's risk management process, management has adopted an integrated risk management framework to

​
continuously identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor and report current and emerging non-financial risks. As part of this framework, the Company established an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee which is chaired by the Company's Chief Risk and Audit Executive. The ERM Committee oversees the Company's risk management framework, including the implementation of the framework components across the Company and promotes a strong Company-wide culture of risk management, compliance and control. 
Oversight of Certain Key Risks
As part of the Board's responsibility to exercise effective and meaningful oversight of the Company's long-term strategy and risk management process, the Board periodically reviews key risks with management. Informed by the most recent such discussions and given the nature of our operations, our Board gave significant consideration over the past two years to the appropriate oversight structure for risks associated with technology and cybersecurity as well as the risks themselves. 
The Board coordinates with the Audit Committee and Financial Policy Committee to ensure active Board- and Committee-level oversight of the Company's technology and cyber risk profile, enterprise technology and cyber strategies, and information security initiatives. In addition, the Board has delegated primary responsibility for oversight of key risks of the Company to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews technology and cyber risks, as well as the Company's risk mitigation processes and internal control procedures to protect sensitive business information, and receives regular reports from the Chief Information Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer on the Company's technology and cybersecurity programs. In addition, the Financial Policy Committee oversees management's strategy with regard to technology and cyber risks when considering major capital expenditures and acquisitions. The full Board is briefed on enterprise-wide technology and cybersecurity risk management and the overall technology and cybersecurity environment both by the Audit Committee and management. In addition, the Board receives a biannual update from the Chief Information Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer. 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
Each year, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee reviews the various components of our compensation program to determine whether any aspects of the program encourage excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. In 2019, management updated its prior review of the Company's incentive compensation plans as well as the Company's other compensation policies and practices and determined that the Company's compensation plans, programs and policies do not encourage excessive risk taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Management then reviewed these findings with the Committee who concurred. Pay Governance LLC, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, also advised the Committee on this matter and concurred with these findings and conclusions.
Talent Management and Succession Planning
The Board believes that one of its primary responsibilities is to oversee the development and retention of executive talent and to ensure that an appropriate succession plan is in place for our Chief Executive Officer and other members of management. 
Talent management and succession planning are integrated into the Board's annual activities and discussed at both the Board and Committee level to maintain continuity in senior leadership and ensure that the Company has the executive talent it needs to successfully execute the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives. 
Roles and Responsibilities
In consultation with the CEO, Chief People Officer (the "CPO") and other members of management, the Nominating Committee, the Compensation Committee and the full Board review short-term and long-term succession planning for the development, retention and replacement of senior talent both formally at least on an annual basis as well as informally throughout the year in Executive Session and at Director-only Board dinners.

Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility
We see environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters as an essential component of sustainable company performance and integral to the successful implementation of our long-term, customer-focused business strategy to Power the Markets of the Future. ESG considerations inform how we manage our Company, including our risk management framework and our governance mechanisms for Board oversight, how we develop new and innovative products and services that anticipate the evolving needs of our clients and how we deliver sustainable growth that positively impacts the communities in which we operate and local economies across the world. 
Material ESG Factors
Our approach to ESG strategy and corporate sustainability begins with understanding, and acting on, the environmental, social and governance issues that most impact our business performance. As our Company has evolved, so have our material ESG issues. 
During 2017 and 2018, we updated our materiality assessment, based on input from across the Company and alignment with leading external reporting frameworks. In assessing key material topics for our business and sector, we referenced the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) standards, the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Our Corporate Responsibility team also worked with stakeholders across the Company, including Human Resources, Global Real Estate Services, Legal, the Corporate Secretary and Risk & Audit, to identify key priorities based on likelihood and impact at S&P Global. The material ESG topics we identified will strengthen our strategic decision-making. 
Moving forward, we will further sharpen our focus on continuing to: 
 enhance governance processes that promote corporate and social responsibility and accountability; 
 develop a more effective internal risk control environment, including in the areas of technology, cybersecurity and crisis management, and more sustainable environmental management;

​
 foster and promote a diverse, talented and well-trained workforce and performance-driven workplace culture; and 
 identify, develop and provide innovative market-leading ESG products and solutions to ESG issues. 
Environmental
We are committed to promoting environmental sustainability both internally, by minimizing our own corporate environmental footprint as an organization, and externally, by providing tools for sustainable investments in the marketplace. 
Corporate Environmental Stewardship & Management
We strive to reduce our corporate environmental footprint by seeking opportunities for increased efficiency and resource conservation. Recent examples of our commitment to workplace sustainability and environmental stewardship include: 
 Decreasing paper use by 57% since 2013, surpassing our 2018 goal of 15%. 
 Neutralizing emissions from employee travel, earning the official CarbonNeutral® Travel certification. 
 Supplying 375,000 MWh of renewable energy wind power across three Indian districts through low carbon initiatives in 2018. 
External Tools for Sustainable Investment
We invest in developing innovative new products that promote sustainability and a more resource-efficient world by using new technology and data analytics to close market gaps and anticipate consumer needs related to ESG issues. 
In 2018, we were the first index provider to publish carbon metrics on a majority of equity indices. We also continued to build out our ESG data analytics capabilities, including by beginning to test and develop new ESG products and completing a diagnostic phase for the creation of an ESG task force. 
Social
Internal Investment in People
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive performance-driven culture is one of the key components of our corporate strategy to Power the Markets of the Future and a corporate priority set from the top. We invest in emerging talent through our diversity and inclusion and recruitment strategies, talent management and development programs and workforce planning for critical roles. 
Recent performance highlights and human capital initiatives to strengthen our commitment to people and talent development include: 
 Improving our talent management capabilities by appointing a new Chief People Officer to help drive the Company's talent agenda. 
 Consolidating talent acquisition, talent development and diversity and inclusion functions into an integrated organization to better align the Company's human capital management with our corporate strategy and vision. 
 Enhancing our leadership development programs, including by investing more than $8.4 million in the development of our employees during 2018 and introducing two new leadership development programs in 2018 to strengthen and expand our pipeline of mid-level managers and promote internal mobility. 
 Launching EssentialTech initiative at the end of 2018, with more than 14,500 hours of employee training completed during the period from launch through the end of 2018, and establishing a Data Science Academy to enhance the technology skills and training of our workforce and accelerate our ability to solve complex problems using a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development and technology education for all employees.

External Community Involvement
We are committed to serving the communities in which we operate worldwide. The S&P Global Foundation donates to a variety of non-profit organizations and local community programs across our global offices. We also encourage our employees to volunteer and support employee gift-matching to eligible non-profit institutions. In 2018, we accelerated our investment in community organizations through a $20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation. 
Governance
As the Company seeks to meet evolving stakeholder needs, our Board views ESG issues as increasingly essential to the Board's oversight of our business strategy. 
Our Corporate Responsibility leadership structure reflects this imperative. An executive-level Corporate Responsibility Council, co-chaired by the Executive Vice President of Public Affairs, directs our Corporate Responsibility programs and ESG reporting and regularly updates the Board on our corporate responsibility strategy and activities. Other senior leaders provide input through the Diversity and Inclusion Council, Environmental Action Committee and Environmental Health & Safety Committee. Our global Corporate Responsibility team implements day-to-day programs with support from senior managers and relevant corporate functions. 
In recent years, our Board of Directors has also taken active steps, summarized in the chart on page 8 and described more fully on pages 9 through 11 of this Proxy Statement, to enhance the Company's corporate governance environment. Reflecting our ongoing commitment to integrity and transparency, we continue to refine governance policies and procedures, taking into account evolving best practices.
Process for Identifying and Evaluating Directors and Nominees
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews with the Board, on an annual basis, the current composition of the Board and identifies the types of skills and qualifications desirable for future Board members in light of the current and anticipated needs of the Board and its committees. 
Based on its annual review, the Committee recommends to the Board the general selection criteria for proposed Director nominees, screens potential Director candidates and recommends the slate of Director nominees for election to the Board at the Company's Annual Meeting. 
We believe that continual Board development through thoughtful Board refreshment and proactive Director succession planning is an integral part of the Company's long-term strategy and the Committee periodically reviews its refreshment and succession process. 
Board Refreshment and Succession Planning
Board Refreshment
To ensure the right balance of fresh new perspectives with the institutional knowledge contributed by our longer-serving Directors, the Committee oversees and reviews practices to enhance the Board's refreshment process. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines incorporate refreshment mechanisms, including mandatory retirement from re-election after reaching age 72 and mandatory resignation offers upon a change in circumstances described further on page 9 of this Proxy Statement. We value the historical knowledge and experience our long-term Directors bring to the Board. Although the Committee considers Director tenure as a factor in identifying the slate of Director nominees, tenure alone is not a critical or determinative factor.

​
Succession Planning and Director Recruitment Process
In anticipation of retirements, resignations and evolving strategic needs for new skills and capabilities, the Committee regularly oversees policies for Board refreshment and conducts proactive, strategy-driven Director succession planning to ensure the Board's members bring the right balance of skills, experience, tenure and diversity to effectively promote, support and oversee the implementation of our long-term strategy. 
In 2018, the Committee developed a multiphase succession planning and Director recruitment process to identify and evaluate potential new Director candidates. 
Assess Board Composition
The Committee evaluates the skills, qualifications and backgrounds of existing Board members and potential Director candidates both formally, in connection with its annual review of Board composition, as well as informally on an ongoing basis, as the strategic needs of the Company and the Board evolve. 
In addition to qualities of intellect, integrity and judgment, the Committee's ongoing assessment of Board composition takes into consideration factors including diversity, background and tenure, as well as senior management experience and an understanding of some combination of marketing, finance, technology, international business matters, government regulation, public policy and the global capital and commodity markets. 
The Committee also gives careful consideration to: 
 Current needs of the Board and its Committees in light of their existing leadership structure, composition and size, as well as the particular skill sets and perspectives that the Committee expects to lose as a result of any planned departures and Directors approaching retirement; 
 Anticipated future needs of the Board and its Committees in light of the strategic challenges and evolving business needs facing the Company based on the Company's long-term strategy and risk profile; and 
 Director feedback gathered from the Board's annual self-evaluation. 
Through the annual and ongoing assessment process, the Committee and the Board seek to identify a complementary mix of individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets that reflect the Company's strategic direction and the broad set of short-term and long-term challenges that the Board confronts.

Identify Diverse Pool of Candidates
Based on its annual and ongoing assessment of Board composition, the Committee develops an evolving list of selection criteria for prospective Directors and identifies priority candidate profiles to use in proactive, strategy-driven Board recruitment that guides the Committee's search for a diverse pool of prospective Director candidates. 
As part of the multi-year succession planning started in 2018, the Committee identified the following four priority skill profiles for the Committee's current 2018/2019 search for prospective Directors to complement the Board's existing skills and experience and enhance the Board's ability to deliver on long-term strategic, succession and leadership objectives. The Committee and the Board continually monitor and reassess which skills and qualifications to prioritize to enhance Board effectiveness as the Company's strategic challenges and opportunities, the market environment and existing Board composition evolve. 
Candidates may come to the Committee's attention through recommendations from current Board members, senior management, professional search firms, shareholders or other sources. The Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate search firms to assist the Board in identifying prospective Director nominees and to approve the fees and other retention terms of any such search firms. 
In 2018, the Committee engaged Russell Reynolds Associates, a director and executive search firm, to assist in identifying and screening potential Director candidates.
Evaluate Candidates
The Board delegates the candidate screening process to the Committee with direct input from the Chairman of the Board. The Committee evaluates all nominees for Director, including nominees recommended by shareholders, regardless of who recommends the candidate for consideration. 
Factors Considered Evaluating Director Candidates:
✔
Experience, skills and qualifications 
​
✔
Diversity factors 
​
✔
Balancing director longevity with fresh new perspectives 
​
✔
Long-term strategy, competitive dynamics and market environment
​
✔
Short-term needs and skills gaps 
​
✔
Cultural fit and personal attributes 
​
✔
Outside Board service and other time commitments

​
As part of the evaluation process, the Committee reviews and considers available information regarding each candidate, including skills and qualifications, as well as diversity of background, experience and thought (including age, gender, race/ethnicity and geography). Although the Committee considers diversity as a factor in assessing the appropriate skills and qualifications required of Board members, the Board does not have a formal policy with regard to diversity in identifying Director nominees. The Committee also reviews the candidate's independence, potential conflicts and any reputational risks. 
In addition, the Committee evaluates whether candidates are capable of devoting the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors, taking into account their primary occupations, membership on other boards and other responsibilities. The Board appreciates the significant time commitment involved in serving on the Board and its Committees. In 2018, the Board amended its Corporate Governance Guidelines to limit the number of public  company boards on which our Directors may serve (three total boards for public company executive officers; five total public company boards for other directors), unless the Committee determines such outside board service would not impair the Director's service to the Company. The Committee assesses outside board service and other Director time commitments prior to the annual re-nomination of its current Directors and, once elected, Directors are required to seek Committee approval prior to joining the board of another public company. 
Recommend Director Nominee
The Board is responsible for selecting all members of the Board and for recommending such members for election by shareholders. Following the candidate evaluation process, the Committee recommends potential Director nominees to the Board for approval and we ask our shareholders to vote on nominees at the Annual Meeting. 
New Director Nominee
William J. Amelio was identified by Russell Reynolds as a candidate possessing extensive experience and qualifications in the technology sector, international operations and executive leadership. Following the initial screening process, Mr. Amelio was interviewed by the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and other Committee members. His background and qualifications were reviewed and discussed by the Committee with the full Board and Mr. Amelio met with the Board and certain members of management, including the CFO and General Counsel, prior to his recommendation for election to the Board. The Committee and the Board believe that Mr. Amelio will contribute valuable insights and perspective on technology, international operations in strategic markets and executive leadership gained through his experience serving in leadership roles in Asia Pacific and the technology sector. The Board unanimously recommend that Mr. Amelio be elected to the Board at this year's Annual Meeting. 
Shareholder Nominations and Recommendation of Director Candidates
The Committee will consider Director candidates recommended by shareholders and evaluates shareholder candidates based on the same selection criteria it uses for other Director candidates. Shareholder recommendations should be addressed in the manner and by the deadlines described on page 5 of this Proxy Statement to the Corporate Secretary, c/o Office of the General Counsel, S&P Global Inc., 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003. 
Director Training and Education
New Directors participate in a comprehensive orientation and training program to introduce them to the Company and management as well as provide information regarding our business operations and strategy. The orientation program is a valuable part of the Director onboarding process and is periodically reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

In addition, the full Board receives regular management updates on industry and corporate governance developments affecting the Company and conducts in-depth bi-annual strategy sessions to discuss the most critical strategic issues, opportunities and challenges facing the Company. To enhance their understanding of the Company's business, Directors also participate in off-site meetings at our various offices across the globe where they interact directly with local personnel responsible for day-to-day operations. These activities ensure that our Board members remain knowledgeable and informed of the most important business issues facing our Company.

​
 Establishing and approving the compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive Officer's direct reports and approving the overall design of the executive compensation program, with the discretion to approve individual compensation decisions delegated to the Chief Executive Officer; and 
 Reviewing the succession and development plans for executives and other key talent below the direct reports to the Chief Executive Officer. 
Governance, Operations and Procedures
Additional information regarding the Committee's governance, operations and procedures is provided below:
 All current members of the Committee are independent as defined in the rules of the NYSE and qualify as "non-employee directors" (as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 
 The Committee has a Charter that can be viewed and downloaded from the Corporate Governance section of the Company's Investor Relations website at http://investor.spglobal.com. 
Committee Advisors
The Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate all external consultants, to commission surveys or analyses that it determines necessary to fulfill its responsibilities, and to approve the fees of all such external consultants. 
The Committee utilizes the services of Pay Governance LLC as its external compensation advisor for all matters concerning the Company's senior management compensation programs. Pay Governance LLC provides no other executive compensation consulting or other services to the Company or its management. Pay Governance LLC works in cooperation with Company management on matters that come before the Committee but always in its capacity as the Committee's independent advisor and representative. From time to time, management also separately engages the services of Compensation Advisory Partners LLC on various compensation-related matters. 
The Committee has entered into a consulting agreement with Pay Governance LLC that specifies the nature and scope of its responsibilities, which include: (1) reviewing Committee agendas and supporting materials in advance of each meeting and raising questions or issues with management and the Committee Chair, as appropriate; (2) at the Committee's direction, working with management on major proposals in advance of finalization by, and presentation to, the Committee; (3) reviewing drafts of the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the Compensation Committee Report and related tables for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement each year; (4) evaluating the chosen compensation peer group and survey data for competitive comparisons; (5) reviewing comparative data on the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and providing independent analyses and recommendations on the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to the Committee; and (6) proactively advising the Committee on best practices for Board governance of executive compensation. 
In accordance with the Committee's policy on assessing advisor independence, the Committee determined in 2018 that there were no conflicts of interest or issues related to independence that would impact the advice to the Committee from the firm of Pay Governance LLC and the representatives of Pay Governance LLC who advise both the Committee on executive compensation matters and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on Director compensation matters. 
For a further discussion of the role of the Committee in assessing performance and determining compensation with respect to our named executive officers, see pages 58 through 61 of this Proxy Statement.

The Company has for many years had an insurance program in place that provides Directors' and Officers' liability insurance coverage. The Company's current insurance coverage was purchased for the period of May 15, 2018 to May 15, 2019 for a premium of approximately $2.3 million.

Insurance; Great American Insurance Co.; Freedom Specialty Insurance Co.; Travelers Casualty & Surety Company of America; Sompo International and AXIS Insurance Company.

The Company's current fiduciary liability coverage was purchased for the period of May 15, 2018 to May 15, 2019 for a premium of approximately $270,000. This insurance is provided by a consortium of carriers that includes: Illinois National Insurance Company; Hartford Accident & Indemnity; and XL Specialty Insurance Company. 
Transactions with Related Persons
Under SEC rules, we are required to disclose material transactions with the Company in which "related persons" have a direct or indirect material interest. Related persons include any Director, nominee for Director, executive officer of the Company, any immediate family members of such persons, and any persons known by the Company to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of the Company's voting securities. 
Based on information available to us and provided to us by our Directors and executive officers, and other than the items referred to below, we do not believe that there were any such material transactions with related persons in effect since January 1, 2018, or any such material transactions proposed to be entered into during 2019. 
Mr. Christopher Heusler, the spouse of Executive Vice President, Public Affairs, Courtney Geduldig, is employed by the Company as an executive within the Company's Ratings business. During 2018, he received cash compensation of approximately $1,082,000 (including base salary and incentive cash compensation) as well as equity compensation consisting of restricted share units and performance share units, with an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $350,000. In 2018, Mr. Heusler participated in our employee benefit plans on the same basis as other similarly situated employees. 
From time to time, shareholders that own more than five percent of our common stock subscribe to, license or otherwise purchase, in the normal course of business, certain of our products and services. These transactions are negotiated on an arm's-length basis and are subject to review by the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as described below. During 2018, BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. and/or their respective affiliates subscribed to, licensed or otherwise purchased in the normal course of business, certain of our products and services. Revenues recognized by us from subscriptions, licenses and other fees related to our products and services by BlackRock, Inc., The Vanguard Group, Inc. and/or their respective affiliates for fiscal 2018 were approximately $118.6 million and $46 million, respectively. In 2018, the Company refunded BlackRock, Inc. an amount of approximately $101,000 relating amounts previously paid by BlackRock Inc. for index services and data subscriptions. 
The Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and considers transactions with related persons under the Company's written policy that requires the Committee to review and approve any related person transactions. Under the policy, all related persons are required to promptly notify our Corporate Secretary of any proposed related person transaction. Following notice to our Corporate Secretary, the proposed transaction is then presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for its review and consideration at the next Committee meeting. Any ongoing and previously approved related person transactions will be reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis. In reviewing any proposed (or previously approved and ongoing) related person transaction, the Committee must consider all relevant facts and

circumstances, including, without limitation, the commercial reasonableness of the terms, the benefit and perceived benefit, or lack thereof, to the Company, opportunity costs of alternate transactions, the materiality and character of the related person's direct or indirect interest, and the actual or apparent conflict of interest of the related person. Approval of a related person transaction (or ratification of a previously approved and ongoing related person transaction) will be given only if it is determined by the Committee that such transaction is in (or not inconsistent with) the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

Compensation Philosophy
Our compensation philosophy is to reward our executives for creating shareholder value by linking a significant portion of pay to one or more performance metrics tied to value creation. We implement our compensation practices within the framework of pay-for-performance and in a manner that we believe helps us attract the highest-quality talent to our executive ranks and retain these individuals by rewarding excellence in leadership and success in the implementation of our business strategy while driving shareholder value. 
Financial Performance Highlights
Total Shareholder Return
In 2018, S&P Global's total shareholder return was approximately 1%, which exceeded the 4% decline in the return of the overall market and was less than the 13% return of our Form 10-K peer group. As indicated in the performance graph to the right, our cumulative total shareholder return during the previous five years is 11% higher than our Form 10-K peer group and 54% higher than the performance indicator of the overall market (i.e., S&P 500). 
The Form 10-K peer group included in this graph consists of the following companies: Thomson Reuters Corporation, Moody's Corporation, CME Group Inc., MSCI Inc., FactSet Research Systems Inc. and IHS Markit Ltd.

Company Financial Performance
The Company made meaningful progress towards its medium- and longer-term strategy. The Company delivered strong financial results in a volatile market environment in 2018 by showing growth across three key financial measures that the Compensation Committee uses to assess executive officer performance: Incentive Compensation Program ("ICP") Adjusted Revenue, ICP Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Amortization Margin ("ICP Adjusted EBITA Margin") and ICP Adjusted Earnings Per Share ("ICP Adjusted EPS"): 
(1)
Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan ("STIC").

2018 ICP Adjusted EPS incorporates the pro forma effect of  (a) divestitures, (b) changes in tax law, and (c) benefits from structural organizational changes making ICP Adjusted EPS results comparable to 2015 Baseline ICP Adjusted EPS results.
​
Significant Business Milestones
In addition to delivering the strong financials above, other 2018 highlights that advanced our Company medium- and longer-term strategy to Power the Markets of the Future include: 
 Global: Expanded our global focus and opportunities for long-term growth in emerging markets through plans for our Ratings business to enter the domestic Chinese bond market and the development of machine-learning tools to provide greater transparency to Chinese capital markets by S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
 Customer Orientation: Delivered greater customer value through deeper client and market insights, innovative solutions, stronger internal teamwork and more reliable, nimble processes and market tools to enhance the customer experience and provide actionable intelligence, including through the launch of Ratings360™, RatingsDirect™ on the Market Intelligence Platform and Platts LNG Service. 
 Operational Excellence: Rolled out key enterprise-wide initiatives to enhance operational excellence, including by leveraging Lean methodologies and an Agile framework, as well as automation and

​
machine  learning, to encourage cross-organizational collaboration, decentralize decision making and drive greater operational efficiency and productivity. 
 Technology: Promoted the development of new capabilities in technology, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning by completing strategic acquisitions of Panjiva and Kensho Technologies, exploring opportunities to enhance financial-related search capabilities and developing a new blockchain application. 
 Innovation: Grew our portfolio of innovative products and services in environmental, social and governance (ESG) data, benchmarks and analytics, including unveiling an ESG evaluation tool, and explored new ways to foster innovation through infrastructure improvement and public-private collaboration. 
 People: Increased focus on talent development and fostering a stronger workplace culture by engaging a new Chief People Officer, introducing more progressive employee benefits, launching new leadership-development and educational programs and strengthening the pipeline of emerging leaders. 
Pay-for-Performance Overview
2018 STIC Funding and 2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Payouts
S&P Global had strong annual operational and financial performance in a volatile market environment in 2018 and made progress toward the medium-term aspirational targets established for the Company during 2018. In light of the market volatility experienced in the fourth quarter and the Company's commitment to setting challenging performance goals to promote alignment with our shareholders, the Company's achievements in 2018 resulted in below-target funding for the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan ("STIC"). Nevertheless, the Company's strong stock price as well as sustained operational and financial performance during the 2016-2018 cycle resulted in Long-Term Incentive awards earning and paying out above target. Enterprise-level STIC funding for 2018 was 89% of target (see pages 71 through 72), the 2016 Long-Term PSU Award earned and paid out at 177% of target (see pages 76  and 77), and the 2016 Dow Jones Indices Long-Term Cash Award earned and paid out at 200% of target (see page 77).
CEO Target Compensation
In the graphic to the right, we have shown Target Total Direct Compensation ("TDC"), which is equal to the aggregate of base salary, target annual incentive award opportunity and long-term incentive grants, assuming target performance, for our CEO, Mr. Peterson, in 2017, 2018, and 2019. As discussed in further detail in the "Setting Compensation" section beginning on page 59 of this Proxy Statement, in consultation with the independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee considered several factors such as individual performance and market competitiveness and approved an 11.7% increase in Mr. Peterson's target TDC for 2019 as compared to 2018.
*
Excludes a $2 million one-time, special RSU grant made in 2018 in recognition of Mr. Peterson's superior individual performance and leadership, and the exceptional performance of the Company in 2017. For more information on this grant, see page 77.
​
​
Say-on-Pay
The Company values shareholder perspectives on our executive compensation program. At the 2017 Annual Meeting, shareholders voted in favor of casting an advisory vote on the executive compensation program for the Company's NEOs—the "say-on-pay" vote—on an annual basis. As part of the Compensation Committee's annual review of the program, it considers the outcome of the Company's annual shareholder advisory vote on 
       2019 Proxy Statement       53
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
​
the compensation of the Company's NEOs. Approximately 97% of the "say-on-pay" advisory votes cast in 2018 were in favor of our executive compensation program. 
Although the 2018 "say-on-pay" results indicated strong support for our program, the Company believes it is important to engage with our shareholders, regardless of our approval rating. As described in further detail on pages 15 through 17  of this Proxy Statement, we engage in active year-round dialogue and outreach with our shareholders to discuss governance, executive compensation and other matters, and to solicit shareholder feedback. No significant concerns relating to the Company's compensation program were raised by investors this year during our shareholder engagement efforts. 
Examples of prior compensation program changes made in response to shareholder feedback are highlighted on page 62 of this Proxy Statement and affirm our responsiveness to and alignment with our shareholders. 
Decisions for 2019
2019 STIC
At the beginning of 2018, we announced the launch of a new, integrated operating model to provide the framework for our forward-looking business strategy to deliver an exceptional, differentiated customer experience across the globe and Power the Markets of the Future by promoting and enhancing our development in the key strategic areas of finance, customer, operations and people. In connection with the integrated operating strategy and key business objectives, we also introduced a balanced scorecard approach to the STIC program to reward, measure and track progress against our operating plan. 
As part of its annual review of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee further refined the plan design for the 2019 STIC in order to enhance the alignment of performance incentives with our Company's business strategy. For NEO division leaders, the weighting assigned to enterprise-level and division-level financial performance under the division-wide scorecards will be a blend of 17% enterprise and 68% division financials, in contrast to the equal weighting between enterprise and division financials under the 2018 STIC scorecards. 
The division scorecards will continue to feature revenue growth and EBITA margin as the performance metrics for enterprise and division financial goals and incorporate key performance indicators to inform the measurement of our progress in the areas of customer, operations and people. There will be no change to the proportion of incentive payments allocated to our executives based upon individual performance. 
Further information regarding the 2019 plan design under the STIC can be found beginning on page 74 of this Proxy Statement. 
2019 Stock Incentive Plan
In addition, the Company is also asking shareholders to approve a new long-term incentive plan for our long-term incentive awards, which, if approved, would replace the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan builds on the terms of the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan and incorporates additional corporate governance best practices to further align our equity compensation program with the interests of our shareholders, including by removing "liberal" share counting provisions. See "Item Three — Proposal to Approve of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan" beginning on page 114 of this Proxy Statement for more details regarding these and other plan changes. 
Other previous significant design changes to our executive compensation program are highlighted on page 62 of this Proxy Statement.

Compensation Objectives
The main objectives of our executive compensation program are: 
 To hire and retain high-caliber executive talent with the leadership abilities and experience necessary to implement our business strategy while driving shareholder value; 
 To pay for performance and sustainable, long-term growth by rewarding the achievement of challenging business and individual performance goals; 
 To build value for shareholders and encourage growth by linking a significant portion of compensation to Company performance with an appropriate balance of short-term and long-term objectives to deepen the alignment of our executives to our shareholders; and 
 To manage risk through oversight and compensation design to ensure that our incentive programs appropriately motivate our executives to encourage prudent, but not excessive, risk-taking. 
Pay Mix
In establishing an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay to reward Company, line of business and individual performance, the Compensation Committee balances the importance of meeting our short-term business goals and maintaining a competitive compensation package designed to attract, motivate and retain experienced and talented executive officers with the need to create shareholder value and drive growth over the longer-term. Our integrated compensation framework heavily weights variable compensation to reward achievements against pre-established, quantifiable financial performance objectives and individual strategic performance objectives. 
In addition, because a significant portion of variable compensation is delivered in the form of equity-based awards, which vest over three years, the value ultimately realized by our executives from these awards depends on stockholder value creation, as measured by the future performance of our stock price.

​
Setting Compensation
The Compensation Committee considers the following factors in using its discretion to determine the amount and form of compensation to be awarded to each of our NEOs. 
Use of Market Data
Our Compensation Committee independently evaluates the performance of the CEO and establishes the CEO's total annual target compensation so that his base salary, target annual incentive opportunity and target long-term incentive awards are competitive against market data for our Proxy Peer Group (detailed below) in addition to compensation survey data (described below) from financial services and general industry firms. The Compensation Committee refers its recommendations to the independent Directors of the Board for review and ratification. For more information on CEO historical and current target total direct compensation, see page 53 of this Proxy Statement. 
For our NEOs other than the CEO, we review the range of market compensation between the 25th and 75th percentiles for our Proxy Peer Group as well as company data provided in the compensation surveys described below to develop an understanding of market pay levels for each position. In general, we design our executive compensation program to pay median levels of compensation for target levels of achievement, to pay below median for achievement below target, and to pay above median compensation for significantly higher levels of achievement versus target goals. 
We annually review compensation market data in setting base salaries and short-term and long-term incentive opportunities for all our NEOs. However, we do not limit or increase individual incentive payments based solely on these market reference points. We also consider factors such as internal pay equity, input from Pay Governance as our independent compensation consultant, risk management and governance, shareholder input, individual and Company performance, business and market conditions, the critical skills and experience of the NEO and the strategic importance of his or her role to the Company. 
For purposes of setting compensation targets for 2018 and 2019, the Compensation Committee was provided with competitive data for our Proxy Peer Group by Pay Governance as well as information from two compensation surveys in which the Company participates: the McLagan Financial Services Survey and the Willis Towers Watson General Industry Executive Compensation Survey.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
​
Proxy Peer Group
The Compensation Committee reviews the composition of the Proxy Peer Group each year to ensure it remains appropriate to use in competitive analysis of executive compensation from size, industry and business model perspectives. 
In reviewing and identifying our 2018 Proxy Peer Group, the Compensation Committee considered a number of factors including shareholder advisor methodologies to identify peer groups, and the annual revenue, market capitalization and mix of businesses of the companies considered and selected. With the assistance of Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee identified companies (listed below) to serve as market reference points for compensation comparison purposes for 2018, with particular reference to industry, revenue and market capitalization. Since we have few direct competitors for the specific scope of our business activities, the companies represented in our Proxy Peer Group vary in terms of firm size and business model. 
Survey Peer Groups
Survey data allows the Compensation Committee to compare compensation levels for certain roles to a wider spectrum of companies and benchmark them to a broader market for talent. 
The companies that comprise the McLagan survey peer group are listed below. The Willis Towers Watson survey does not identify the specific companies that reported compensation information. 
2018 Peer Group Companies
In terms of size, as shown in the table below, at the end of 2018, the Company's annual revenue was between the median and the 75th percentile and the Company's market capitalization was above the 75th percentile of the Proxy Peer Group.
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  2018 Proxy Peer Group   ​ ​ ​  Revenue ($ billions)   ​ ​ ​  Market Cap. ($ billions)   ​ 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of setting 2019 compensation targets, the Compensation Committee determined that the current Proxy Peer Group remained an appropriate comparison group for the Company and therefore no changes were necessary.

​
Internal Pay Equity
The Compensation Committee also takes into account internal equity when making pay decisions. While there is not an established formal policy on internal pay equity guidelines, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation levels to ensure that the appropriate internal equity exists. This is determined based on various considerations, including management of revenue or operating profit, headcount responsibility, geographic scope, and job complexity. 
Performance and Talent Assessment
The Compensation Committee's consideration is further informed by the Company's performance evaluation process that measures management against individual qualitative and quantitative goals, behaviors and competencies aligned with the Company's strategic plan. The goals reflect financial targets inclusive of short-term operating goals, long-term value creation, human capital initiatives, and risk and compliance expectations. The Compensation Committee along with the entire Board (other than the CEO with respect to his review) participates in an annual review and discussion of each NEO as well as succession planning for each position. Further information on the Company's business performance as well as each NEO's key individual achievements for 2018 can be found beginning on page 64 of this Proxy Statement. Additionally, further information about succession planning can be found beginning on page 19 of this Proxy Statement. 
Other Factors
The Compensation Committee also considers input from its independent compensation consultant and our shareholders as well as additional factors, including business and market conditions, leadership skills and experience, risk management and governance, and tax deductibility and accounting considerations. Further information on the role of the independent compensation consultant and our shareholders can be found on page 58 of this Proxy Statement.

NEO Compensation Decisions in 2018
The table below shows the Compensation Committee's compensation decisions for 2018 for the NEOs and is different from the SEC required disclosure in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" beginning on page 85. It is a blend of annualized base salary and compensation that is actually paid (incentive payout) or granted (long-term incentive grants) that together reflects the total annual 2018 compensation decision for each NEO. 
The Compensation Committee established the calendar year base salary and annual long-term incentive grant amount for each NEO early in the fiscal year. The annual incentive payout amount was calculated and paid after the fiscal year ended based on the incentive plan funding and the individual performance of each NEO, as described below.

2019 Base Salary Determination
Our Compensation Committee independently evaluates the performance of the CEO and establishes the CEO's base salary so that, together with his target annual incentive opportunity and stock-based long-term incentive awards, his total annual target compensation is competitive against our Proxy Peer Group and market data for the financial services and general industry. For 2019, the Compensation Committee determined not to increase Mr. Peterson's base salary. 
As discussed beginning on page 59, the base salaries for the other NEOs reflect findings from our Proxy Peer Group and annual market surveys as well as considerations of their individual contributions, performance, time in role, scope of responsibility, leadership skills and experience. For 2019, the Compensation Committee determined not to increase the base salaries of Messrs. Steenbergen, Berisford and Matturri.

2018 Short-Term Annual Incentive Funding and Payout Determination Formulas
2018 Short-Term Annual Incentive Plan Design Under the STIC
For all NEOs, individual incentive amounts are determined based on the executive's target incentive award opportunity, which is then adjusted by a factor based upon the achievement of enterprise-level and, as appropriate for our division leaders, division-level goals (70%), and achievement of individual strategic goals (30%). 
 The incentive target opportunity for each NEO is in part determined based on market data as well as individual performance and experience. For a more detailed description of how we set compensation targets, see pages 59 through 61 of this Proxy Statement. 
 The enterprise-level performance component for 2018 was tied to ICP Adjusted Revenue and ICP Adjusted EBITA Margin, which includes adjustments for unspent strategic investment funds and acquisitions. The applicable division-level goals for our NEO division leaders, Messrs. Berisford, Chinn and Matturri, are set out in the graphic above. The Compensation Committee believes that these metrics reward performance to achieve short-term business objectives that draw focus to productivity measures, create greater efficiencies and strengthen the importance of growth and scale to the Company, which ultimately drives increased shareholder value. 
 The individual component is allocated based on an assessment of each participant's achievement against strategic or developmental goals established at the beginning of the year. The maximum incentive award opportunity is capped at 200% of each participant's target award. 
Following the performance period, the overall incentive award pool is funded based on the achievement of Company and division performance goals. The final payout amount is allocated to individual participants and adjusted upwards or downwards based on individual achievement in accordance with the methodology described above. 
2018 Short-Term Annual Incentive Payouts
2018 Short-Term Annual Incentive Plan Business Performance Goals
The 2018 short-term annual incentive payouts for all of the NEOs are based 70% on business performance and 30% on individual performance. For Messrs. Peterson and Steenbergen, the business performance component is measured on an enterprise balanced scorecard of 85% financial and 15% business-building goals. The financial goals are based 42.5% on Company ICP Adjusted EBITA Margin and 42.5% on Company ICP Adjusted Revenue.

For the portion of incentive funding based on enterprise financial goals, the Compensation Committee reviewed reported 2018 Revenue and EBITA margin for the Company and adjusted for unspent strategic investment funds and acquisitions in 2018 to determine adjusted non-GAAP financial performance for incentive compensation purposes.
The Compensation Committee uses ICP Adjusted Revenue and ICP Adjusted EBITA Margin to evaluate the financial results achieved by the NEOs independent of items considered isolated, non-recurring, or unusual because it believes that such metrics better measure the Company's normal revenue, operating expenses, and operating results for compensation purposes.
For a reconciliation of the adjustments to comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, please see Exhibit A. The non-GAAP financial information included on Exhibit A has been provided in order to show investors how our Compensation Committee views the Company's performance as it relates to the compensation program for our NEOs. 
Company ICP Adjusted EBITA Margin improved to 48.7%, representing an expansion of 220 Basis Points, and Company ICP Adjusted Revenue grew 2.8% over 2017. Based on these blended results, the 2018 achievement and funding for the Company's enterprise-level financial goals was 87%. 
For the remaining 15% of incentive funding based on the achievement of enterprise-level business-building goals in the three categories of customer, operations and people (each category accounting for 5% of funding), the Compensation Committee reviewed performance for each category of the Company business-building goals based on consideration of various quantitative and qualitative key performance indicators (KPIs), such as net

As discussed in detail above, 70% of the individual short-term annual incentive award was determined based on Company financial results (or a blend of the Company funding and division results for division presidents) and achievement of business-building metrics. For all NEOs, including the CEO, the remaining 30% was allocated based on the achievement of individual strategic or developmental goals (our NEOs' key achievements for 2018 are described on pages 64 through 68 of this Proxy Statement).

2019 Short-Term Annual Incentive Plan Design and Targets
2019 Short-Term Annual Incentive Plan Design Under the STIC
As discussed on page 54 of this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee readjusted the relative weighting of the enterprise-level and division-level financial metrics used to determine the overall incentive funding for our division presidents under the 2019 STIC in order to enhance the alignment of performance incentives with the Company's business strategy. The weighting assigned to the blend of enterprise- and division-level financial goals under the scorecards for our division presidents will be a mix of 17% enterprise and 68% division financials, in contrast to the equal weighting of enterprise and division financials under the 2018 STIC. 
The metrics selected for the portion of the funding formula attributable to financial performance will continue to be a combination of enterprise- and division-level adjusted EBITA margin and adjusted revenue. Business-building metrics in the key strategic areas of customer, operations and people will each continue to account for 5% of scorecard funding, and plan funding and individual payouts will remain capped at 200% of target. There will also be no change to the proportion of incentive payments allocated to our executives based on the achievement of individual strategic goals. 
The Compensation Committee believes that these adjustments to the relative weighting of the balanced scorecard metrics reward performance in a manner designed to promote the Company's business strategy and integrated operating model, which drives increased shareholder value. 
2019 Short-Term Annual Incentive Award Target Determination
Our Compensation Committee independently evaluates the performance of the CEO and establishes the CEO's 2019 target annual incentive award so that, together with his base salary and long-term incentive award, his total target annual compensation is market competitive and motivates and rewards him for performance against Company and individual goals. For 2019, the Compensation Committee determined not to increase Mr. Peterson's target annual incentive award amount. 
As discussed beginning on page 59, the target annual incentive award amounts for the other NEOs reflect findings from our Proxy Peer Group and annual market surveys as well as considerations of their individual contributions and the strategic importance of the respective roles to the Company. For 2019, the Compensation Committee determined not to increase the target annual incentive award amounts for Messrs. Steenbergen and Berisford and to increase the target annual incentive amount for Mr. Matturri to maintain market alignment. Mr. Chinn is not eligible to participate in the 2019 STIC due to his resignation, effective January 2, 2019, and expected departure from the Company in March 2019.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan Award Structures
2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan Award Design
To ensure that the Long-Term Incentive Plan supports the main objectives of our executive compensation program and the Company's business strategy, we periodically review our Plan and the structure of our long-term incentive awards granted pursuant to the Plan to make adjustments as our business needs change. 
 The long-term incentive award is delivered as a mix of 70% performance share units (PSUs) and 30% restricted stock units (RSUs), except for Mr. Matturri (described below). 
 Both PSUs and RSUs have three-year cycles but the RSUs are solely time-based and are not tied to performance goals. The mix of PSUs and RSUs balances incentives based on stock price appreciation and performance factors not directly related to stock price. 
 The 2018 PSU awards are measured based on ICP Adjusted EPS growth over a three-year performance cycle to evaluate the results achieved by the Company independent of items considered isolated, non-recurring, or unusual because we believe that such metrics better measure the Company's normal revenue, operating expenses, and operating results for compensation purposes. ICP Adjusted EPS provides a good measure of return to shareholders because it considers capital allocation decisions as well as the importance of continued discipline in operating performance.
 Commencing in 2017, the Compensation Committee modified the vesting schedule of RSUs to vest ratably over three years rather than cliff vesting after three years to provide a more effective recruitment tool. In connection with its annual review of the Company's compensation program, the 
       2019 Proxy Statement       75
TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
​
Compensation Committee found that this change was appropriately balanced by the three-year cliff vesting schedule for PSU awards, which generally represent 70% of the total long-term grant value for NEOs. 
 As the Chief Executive Officer of S&P Dow Jones Indices, Mr. Matturri's long-term incentive award differs from that of the other NEOs. S&P Dow Jones Indices is a joint venture between S&P Global and CME Group. In order to align Mr. Matturri's interests more closely with the financial performance of the joint venture, 60% of his award consists of performance-based long-term cash measured based on the ICP Adjusted EBITA growth of the joint venture over a three-year performance cycle. The remaining 40% of his award is made up of a mix of 70% S&P Global PSUs and 30% S&P Global RSUs. The PSUs are measured based on the same S&P Global ICP Adjusted EPS growth goal described above. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards
2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan Award Goals
In 2018, the Company continued to use an ICP Adjusted EPS growth goal for the 2018-2020 performance period for PSUs, which we believe continues to allow us to evaluate the results achieved by the Company independent of items considered isolated, non-recurring, or unusual because it believes that such metrics better measure the Company's normal revenue, operating expenses, and operating results for compensation purposes. ICP Adjusted EPS provides a good measure of return to shareholders because it considers capital allocation decisions as well as the importance of continued discipline in operating performance.
The following payout schedule was approved for the 2018 PSU Awards for the 2018-2020 performance period: 
The following payout schedule was approved for the 2018 Long-Term Cash Awards for the S&P Dow Jones Indices 2018-2020 performance period:

2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan Award Achievement
2016-2018 PSU Achievement
Our 2016 PSU award for the 2016-2018 performance period was based on the achievement of the following ICP Adjusted EPS growth goal during the cycle: 
The cumulative compound ICP Adjusted EPS growth during the cycle was 18.1%. The Compensation Committee uses ICP Adjusted EPS growth during the three-year cycle to evaluate the results achieved by the Company independent of items considered isolated, non-recurring, or unusual because we believe that such metrics better measure the Company's normal recurring revenue, operating expenses, and operating results for compensation purposes. Based on this achievement, the 2016 PSU award was earned at 177% of target. 
2016-2018 S&P Dow Jones Indices Long-Term Cash Award Achievement
60% of Mr. Matturri's 2016 long-term incentive award for the performance period 2016-2018 was in the form of long-term cash (with the remaining 40% in the form of a mix of 70% PSUs and 30% RSUs, as described above), which long-term cash was earned based on the achievement of the following cumulative Division ICP Adjusted EBITA growth goal during the cycle: 
During the cycle, cumulative Division ICP Adjusted EBITA growth was 12.7%. Based on this achievement, the long-term cash award for S&P Dow Jones Indices performance was earned at 200% of target. For detail on Mr. Matturri's actual payout, see footnote 3 to the Summary Compensation table on page 85. 
2019 Long-Term Incentive Award Design and Targets
2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan Award Design
The Compensation Committee approved an EPS growth metric over a three-year performance cycle for the 2019 PSU awards, which it believes provides a good measure of return to our shareholders because it considers capital allocation decisions as well as the importance of continual discipline in operating performance. The Committee also approved an S&P Dow Jones Indices Division ICP Adjusted EBITA growth metric over a three-year performance cycle for the long-term cash portion of Mr. Matturri's 2019 long-term award. 
2019 Long-Term Incentive Target Determination
Our Compensation Committee independently evaluates the performance of the CEO and establishes the CEO's 2019 long-term incentive target so that, together with his base salary and short-term incentive award, his total annual target compensation is market competitive and motivates and rewards him for performance against Company and individual goals. For 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Peterson's long-term incentive target amount should be increased from $6,820,000 to $8,000,000 to maintain market alignment. 
As discussed beginning on page 59, the long-term incentive amounts for the other NEOs reflect findings from our Proxy Peer Group and annual market surveys as well as considerations of their individual contributions and strategic importance of their respective roles to the Company. For 2019, the Compensation Committee determined not to increase the target long-term incentive amount for Mr. Berisford and to increase the long-term target incentive amounts for Messrs. Steenbergen and Matturri to maintain market alignment.

One-Time, Special Long-Term Incentive Grant
In January 2018, in recognition of Mr. Peterson's superior individual performance and leadership, and the exceptional performance of the Company in 2017, the Committee approved a one-time, special incentive award with a grant date value of  $2 million, in the form of restricted stock units. The award cliff-vests after three years and was granted on April 2, 2018.
The Compensation Committee determined to pay the special incentive award in the form of restricted stock units, subject to ongoing, continuous service for the three-year period following grant, rather than increasing Mr. Peterson's overall target compensation. The value of the award ultimately realized by Mr. Peterson depends on stockholder value creation, as measured by the three year performance of our stock price, which further aligns his compensation with the Company's longer-term performance and shareholder interests.
For detailed information concerning this grant, see the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table beginning on page 88 of this Proxy Statement.
Benefits and Perquisites
Health and Welfare Benefits
The Company provides a uniform healthcare benefit program for all U.S.-based employees, including the NEOs. The employee healthcare contributions are differentiated by salary levels, requiring higher-paid employees to make larger contributions for their healthcare coverage. We provide no supplemental executive healthcare benefits other than a Company paid annual physical examination for the NEOs and certain other senior executives. Additionally, the NEOs and certain other executives participate in our Management Supplemental Death & Disability Benefits Plan. Pursuant to the executive life insurance policy provided under the Plan, in the event of the executive's death prior to retirement, the executive's beneficiary will receive a lump sum amount equal to 200% of the executive's base salary in effect at the time of the executive's death, up to a maximum benefit of  $2 million. The Plan also provides a supplemental long-term disability benefit, fully funded by the Company, equal to 50% of the executive's monthly earnings, as defined in the Plan, less other Company-paid benefits and Social Security benefit payments. 
Perquisites
We provide a limited number of perquisites to our NEOs, which we believe are reasonable in amount, competitive, and consistent with our overall compensation plan, to enable them to conduct Company business more effectively and to allow greater focus on the demands of their positions. These perquisites, such as professional services (inclusive of financial counseling, tax planning and preparation, and estate planning), annual executive physical exams, a Company car and driver for our CEO for security purposes and reimbursement for other reasonable travel and business-related expenses, involve minimal cost to the Company and constitute a small percentage of our NEOs' total compensation. For additional information on our perquisites and other benefits, see the Summary Compensation Table beginning on page 85 of this Proxy Statement, which includes the incremental cost to the Company for providing these benefits. 
We do not provide tax gross-ups in respect of any income recognized by our NEOs as a result of receiving the reimbursements or perquisites described above.

Retirement and Other Benefits following Termination of Employment
In connection with their retirement or other termination of employment, our NEOs will generally be eligible to receive benefits under our retirement plans and, depending on the circumstances of an executive's termination, severance benefits. These post-termination benefits are described beginning on page 96 of this Proxy Statement. 
Retirement Benefits
Effective as of April 1, 2012, we froze accruals and participation under both of our defined benefit pension plans under which Messrs. Berisford and Matturri are entitled to benefits: the Employee Retirement Plan of S&P Global Inc. and its Subsidiaries, a pension plan covering some of our U.S. employees, and the S&P Global Inc. Employee Retirement Plan Supplement, a non-qualified pension plan. Our defined contribution plans are provided to all employees, including our senior executives, to allow them to accumulate assets for retirement through a combination of individual savings and Company contributions and to allow participants in these plans the opportunity to direct the investment of these retirement assets. 
Other Benefits
Our NEOs may also participate in the charitable S&P Global Matching Gift Program, open to all employees and Directors of the Company, which provides the opportunity to help maximize the impact of eligible charitable giving through a corporate matched contribution generally up to a maximum participant donation of  $5,000 (or the currency equivalent) in the aggregate per year. In 2018, the Company elected to double the corporate matched contribution for charitable contributions made during certain periods of the year to a corporate match of up to $10,000 in the aggregate. Retirees are also eligible to participate in this program for up to three years after they leave the Company and are no longer active employees or directors.
In addition, our NEOs, as well as other eligible employees and Directors of the Company, may participate in the S&P Global Political Action Committee ("S&P Global PAC"), which is funded by eligible U.S.-based participants in accordance with applicable federal law. Under the S&P Global PAC program, the Company contributes funds to a charitable organization of the participant's choosing that match the participant's contribution to the S&P Global PAC, up to an annual maximum of  $5,000.

Severance Benefits (Regular and Change-in-Control)
The Compensation Committee believes that maintaining a competitive level of separation benefits is appropriate as part of our overall compensation program and in line with its objective to attract, retain and motivate high-caliber management talent. Our severance arrangements with all of our NEOs are governed by our Senior Executive Severance Plan. This severance program is designed to promote employee loyalty, to provide employees with security and reasonable compensation upon an involuntary termination of employment, and to ensure the continued commitment of employees in the event of a potential or actual change-in-control. The Compensation Committee does not take into account the benefits offered under the Senior Executive Severance Plan in setting compensation for our NEOs. 
The Senior Executive Severance Plan generally provides for base salary and benefits continuation in the event of a Company-initiated termination (including a "constructive" termination) other than a termination for cause, as defined on page 96 of this Proxy Statement. Discussion of severance payable on certain qualifying terminations (including following a change-in-control of the Company) can be found in the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control section on pages 96 through 100 of this Proxy Statement. 
Payments of annual incentives under the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and vesting acceleration or modification of long-term cash awards and equity awards granted under our 2002 Stock Incentive Plan on the occurrence of a defined change-in-control are described in the table below. Upon certain qualifying terminations not in connection with a defined change-in-control, an NEO may be entitled to a pro rata portion of the NEO's annual cash incentive award and certain outstanding equity awards. For details, see pages 98 through 100 of this Proxy Statement.

​
Certain payments that would be provided to our NEOs in connection with a change-in-control could be classified as "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, in which case they would not be deductible as compensation by the Company. In addition, Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on executives who receive an excess parachute payment equal to 20% of such amount. The excise tax would not be reimbursed or "grossed up" by the Company. Instead, as discussed on page 97 of this Proxy Statement, in certain circumstances, we would "cut back" the amount of certain benefits and payments to ensure tax deductibility by the Company under Section 280G to the extent the executive's "cut back" amount is greater on an after-tax basis than the full amount. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We are committed to ensuring that our executive officers have a significant ownership stake in the Company to strengthen the alignment of our executives' interests with those of our shareholders. 
The Company has formal stock ownership guidelines for senior executives set at six times (6x) base salary for the CEO and three times (3x) base salary for the other NEOs. These guidelines are aligned with competitive information on executive stock ownership guidelines. The ownership guidelines will be reduced by one-half for executives covered by these guidelines beginning at age 62. This reduction is intended to permit individuals to begin an orderly process of stock sales to provide for diversification as the executives covered by these guidelines get closer to the Company's normal retirement age of 65. 
Until the guidelines for ownership levels are attained, senior executives must retain 100% of net profit shares realized from the exercise of stock options, the payment of PSU and RSU awards, and the vesting of any restricted stock awards. In the event of financial hardship, the ownership guidelines may be waived or suspended in the discretion of the Compensation Committee until the hardship no longer applies. Upon attainment of the guidelines for ownership levels, senior executives must continue to retain 50% of any future net profit shares acquired from stock option exercises for six months. Further, the CEO and his direct reports who are under the purview of the Compensation Committee are subject to this six-month holding period following voluntary termination of employment, including retirement. Once the required number of shares is attained, future salary increases and changes in stock price will no longer have an impact, unless the executive is promoted to a higher guideline ownership level. 
The Compensation Committee applies the following share-counting principles to determine the share ownership level of covered executives under the guidelines:
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  SHARES THAT COUNT   ​ ​ ​  SHARES THAT DO NOT COUNT   ​ 
​• 100% of the shares directly owned ​• 50% of outstanding vested and unvested RSUs ​• 50% of unvested restricted shares ​• 50% of PSUs for which attainment of the performance criteria has already been determined  ​​ ​ ​•  Unexercised options (whether or not vested)•  PSUs for which the performance cycle is ongoing​

[END TABLE]
As of January 1, 2019, all of the NEOs were compliant with the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines and own shares in excess of their ownership guideline multiples. 
Risk and Control
The Compensation Committee considers risks related to compensation policies and practices and incentive related risks. The Compensation Committee establishes performance metrics that reward our executives for creating shareholder value, and establishes goals and payment schedules for each metric that are designed to provide a balance to motivate the achievement of the established goals without the need for inappropriate or excessive risk-taking. 
In 2019, management updated its prior review of the Company's compensation plans as well as Company compensation policies and practices regarding whether they encourage excessive risk-taking and determined that the Company's compensation plans, programs and policies do not present a material risk of causing 
       2019 Proxy Statement       81

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
​
behavior that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Management reviewed its findings with the Compensation Committee and Pay Governance (the Compensation Committee's independent compensation advisor), who each concurred in these findings and conclusions. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee annually assesses plan design, performance metrics and goals for the annual incentive plans within the Company's divisions to ensure that their designs are appropriately aligned with business and regulatory considerations and do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking. 
Pay Recovery Policies
In 2014, the Compensation Committee strengthened its pay recovery (clawback) policy to provide more structure and impact. The Compensation Committee adopted a revised policy providing that annual cash incentive and long-term incentive award payments (PSUs, RSUs, stock options and long-term incentive cash compensation) could be subject to recovery by the Company if one or more of the following occurs: 
 For senior management, material recalculation or adjustment of the performance measures. 
 For all individuals covered by this policy, intentional, willful or grossly negligent act or omission that violates one or more of the Company's policies that have or will have a material negative impact on the Company's business, reputation or financial condition. 
 For all individuals covered by this policy, criminal activity, fraud or other illegal or unlawful activity that has or will have a material negative impact on the business, financial condition or reputation of the Company. 
Additionally, a separate Pay Recovery Policy was adopted for S&P Global Ratings ("S&P Policy"). In addition to the recovery items noted above, the S&P Policy has these recovery items: 
 For all covered individuals, material violations of policy or division or product risk parameters, policies or operating procedures resulting from the gross negligence, intentional wrongdoing or willful misconduct of a covered individual that have or will have a material negative impact on the business, financial condition or reputation of S&P Global Ratings. 
 For all covered individuals, material failure to adequately supervise the administration and implementation of one or more of S&P Global Ratings' policies or division or product risk parameters, policies or operating procedures which results from gross negligence, intentional wrongdoing or willful misconduct that has or will have a material negative impact on S&P Global Ratings' business, financial condition or reputation. 
Senior management and covered individuals include both active and former employees for the covered period. 
As President of S&P Global Ratings, Mr. Berisford is subject to both policies.

Insider Trading Policy
Under the Company's Insider Trading Policy, no shares of Company stock owned by Directors, officers and other designated employees may be pledged as security for a loan. Further, the policy continues to provide that Directors, officers and other designated employees are prohibited without exception from engaging in hedging transactions related to Company stock, such as puts, calls, swaps, collars and other arrangements intended to hedge exposure to Company stock or provide protection against declines in the value of Company stock. 
Employment Agreements
None of our NEOs have formal employment agreements with the Company. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to a public company's chief executive officer and other named executive officers (excluding the company's principal financial officer for tax years prior to 2018) to $1 million during any fiscal year. 
Prior to 2018, this $1 million deduction limit did not apply to compensation that qualified as "performance-based." However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the exemption for performance-based compensation for tax years beginning after 2017, except for providing transition relief for compensation paid pursuant to certain "grandfathered" arrangements in effect on November 2, 2017, and expanded the group of current and former executives covered by the $1 million deduction limit under Section 162(m). 
Before the enactment of the changes to the tax law described above, annual cash incentive awards and long-term equity compensation granted under our shareholder approved Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and 2002 Stock Incentive Plan were structured to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception and intended to be fully tax deductible. Due to limitations to the scope of transition relief, certain of our earlier, outstanding awards granted under the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan or the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, including PSUs, may not satisfy the requirements for exemption from the $1 million deduction limit. The Compensation Committee further expects that any future compensation to certain current and former executive officers in excess of  $1 million during any one fiscal year will not be tax deductible by the Company. 
Although the Compensation Committee generally sought to maximize the tax deductibility of executive compensation, the Committee believes that the primary purpose of the Company's compensation program is to advance the Company's business strategy and the long-term interests of our shareholders, which are best served by retaining flexibility in structuring the Company's compensation programs. Since the performance-based compensation exception is no longer available, the Company will no longer include Section 162(m)-specific limitations or provisions in our incentive plans or request shareholder approval of performance conditions for Section 162(m) purposes; however, the Compensation Committee remains committed to linking executive pay to performance and does not expect the changes to Section 162(m) to significantly alter the performance-driven design of our compensation programs going forward. 
The Compensation Committee also considers the effect of certain accounting rules that apply to the various aspects of the compensation program for our NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviews potential accounting effects in determining whether its compensation actions are in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.

The benefit amounts shown in the table are actuarial present values of the benefits accumulated through December 31, 2018, as described below. The actuarial present value is calculated by estimating the expected future payments starting at an assumed retirement age, weighting the estimated payments by the estimated probability of surviving to each post-retirement age, and discounting the weighted payments at an assumed discount rate to reflect the time value of money. The actuarial present value represents an estimate of the amount which, if invested today at an assumed discount rate of 4.40% for the ERP and 4.37% for the ERPS, would be sufficient on an average basis to provide the estimated future payments based on the benefit currently accrued. The assumed retirement age for each named executive officer is the earliest age at which the executive could retire without any benefit reduction due to age. The actual benefit present values will vary from these estimates depending on many factors, including an executive's actual retirement age. 
​
(2)
As discussed further on page 92 of this Proxy Statement, on April 1, 2012 the Company "froze" the ERP and ERPS to new participants and future accruals. Final benefits for each named executive officer are calculated based on that date, and no additional adjustments are made based on additional service or pay after that date. Messrs. Peterson, Steenbergen and Chinn are not participants in the ERP and ERPS since they did not meet the eligibility requirements by April 1, 2012. 
​
Messrs. Berisford and Matturri are entitled to retirement benefits under two defined benefit plans of the Company: the Employee Retirement Plan of S&P Global, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries (generally referred to as the "ERP") and the S&P Global, Inc. Employee Retirement Plan Supplement (generally referred to as the "ERP Supplement" or "ERPS"). Messrs. Peterson, Steenbergen and Chinn are not participants in these Plans because they did not meet the eligibility requirements before participation was frozen on April 1, 2012. 
Messrs. Berisford and Matturri were fully vested in their benefits in the ERP and ERPS as of December 31, 2018. 
       2019 Proxy Statement       91

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES (continued)
​
Employee Retirement Plan of S&P Global Inc. and Its Subsidiaries ("ERP")
The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension Plan to provide retirement benefits to eligible U.S.-based employees of the Company, which was frozen to new participants and future accruals as of April 1, 2012. The Plan pays benefits at retirement to participants who terminate or retire from the Company after meeting the eligibility requirements for a benefit. The retirement benefit is based on a percentage of a participant's total Plan compensation during such participant's employment with the Company (this is called a career pay formula). 
A Plan participant's annual benefit accrual under the ERP is calculated as 1% of Plan compensation. The Plan compensation includes the participant's base salary and short-term incentive award. Because this is a qualified Plan, the Plan compensation is restricted by the compensation limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2012, the last year for which any benefits accrued under the ERP, this compensation limit was $250,000. The retirement benefit payable from this Plan is the sum of each year's annual benefit accrual. This amount is available unreduced at the earlier of the Plan's normal retirement age of 65 or age 62 if a participant has 10 years of service with the Company. If a participant has attained age 55 with 10 years of service with the Company, an early retirement benefit is available. The benefit is reduced by 4% per year for each year of payment prior to age 62 to reflect the earlier payments. 
Participants can choose from among several optional forms of annuity payments under the ERP. A participant receives the highest monthly payment under a single life annuity, while the other payment forms result in a lower monthly benefit generally because payment may be made to a surviving joint annuitant or beneficiary following the participant's death. 
The present value estimates shown in the Pension Benefits Table assume payment of the named executive officers' accumulated benefits under the ERP, based on pay and service earned through April 1, 2012, in the form of a single life annuity commencing on the earliest date the benefits are available unreduced (age 65 in the case of Mr. Berisford and age 62 in the case of Mr. Matturri). The values assume a discount rate of 4.40% and a mortality assumption based on the fully generational RP-2018 mortality table with MP-2018 improvement scale. 
S&P Global Inc. Employee Retirement Plan Supplement ("ERPS")
The Company also maintains a non-qualified pension Plan, which was similarly frozen to new participants and future accruals as of April 1, 2012. Prior to the freeze, this Plan was intended to help attract and retain the executive workforce by providing benefits incremental to those permitted under the qualified pension Plan. 
The ERPS is designed to restore retirement benefits that cannot be paid under the ERP due to Internal Revenue Code limits. The benefit provided under the ERPS will effectively equal the difference between the benefit that would have been earned under the ERP, without regard to any pay or benefit limits, and the actual benefit payable under the ERP. 
All Plan participants of the ERP are potentially eligible for the ERPS, including Messrs. Berisford and Matturri, provided that their ERP benefits are limited by the Internal Revenue Code limits. In general, a participant's annual accrual under the ERPS is determined based on 1% of the Plan compensation under the ERP in excess of the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit for that year ($250,000 in 2012). The retirement benefit payable under the ERPS is the sum of each year's annual benefit accrual. ERPS payments commence one year following separation from service or, if later, age 65, or age 62 with 10 years of service with the Company. 
The present value estimates shown in the Pension Benefits Table for accumulated benefits under the ERPS assume a discount rate of 4.37% and are determined using the same payment and mortality assumptions as were used to estimate the values shown under the ERP.

The amounts shown as Company contributions represent employer savings and profit sharing contributions under the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan Supplement. In 2013, the employer contribution for the savings plan component increased to 6% of eligible compensation above the IRS compensation limit. In 2014 and later years, participants are required to make employee contributions under the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Supplement to receive the employer contributions to the savings plan component, and the amount of the employer contribution will be based on the amount of the employee contribution, up to 6% of eligible compensation above the IRS compensation limit. In 2012 and 2013, participants were required to make the maximum pre-tax contribution under the qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan in order to receive the savings plan component supplement. These amounts are also included as All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table on pages 85 through 87  of this Proxy Statement.

401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan Stable Assets fund. The annual rate of interest credited under these Plans was 2.5% for the 2018 fiscal year. Account balances under the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan Supplement are distributed to executives in the year following the year in which the executive separates from service. 
Prior to 2014, executives could elect to defer all or part of their annual incentive award payment under the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Deferred Compensation Plan. Earnings on amounts deferred under the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Deferred Compensation Plan are credited at a rate equal to 120% of the applicable Federal Long-Term Rate as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in December of the year prior to the year in which the compensation is credited under the Plan. The interest rate that applied to outstanding balances during the 2018 fiscal year was 3.16%. Account balances under the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Deferred Compensation Plan are distributed to executives in accordance with their individual elections. Participants may elect to receive their deferred award payments in a single lump  sum or in up to 15 equal annual installments. Payments may commence within 60 days of retirement or termination or as of January 1 of the year following the year in which such event occurs. 
In 2014, the Company enhanced the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan Supplement to allow for deferrals of up to 25% of eligible pay above the IRS Compensation limit. As a result of this change, the Company decided to no longer offer a deferral opportunity under the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. 
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the applicable SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees (based on the median, as described below) and that of our President and CEO. We believe that the pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. 
 For 2018, the median annual total compensation of all our employees (other than our CEO) was $26,738, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $12,360,845, as reported in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 85. 
 Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median annual total compensation of all other employees was estimated to be 462 to 1. 
Supplemental Ratio Excluding One-Time, Special Equity Grant
We note that our CEO's annual total compensation in 2018 was significantly impacted by a one-time, special RSU grant, which had a grant date value of  $2 million, in recognition of his superior individual performance and exceptional Company performance in 2017. Excluding the one-time, special RSU grant, our pay ratio would have been 387 to 1. In light of the CEO's special grant, we believe this is a more representative indication of how our CEO pay compares to that of our global workforce. For more information on this grant, see page 78. 
Our Workforce
As a Company with a global workforce, we invest in our employees at all levels and are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits in every business and geography in which we operate. Market pay levels and pay practices are important factors that we consider in setting competitive compensation that rewards performance and meets the needs of our diverse workforce. With offices in 32 countries and approximately 75% of our employees located outside the United States, the global footprint of our business drives the median pay level at S&P Global.

​
Methodology
Pursuant to the SEC rules, the median annual total compensation of all our employees (other than the CEO) is based on the annual total compensation of our "median employee." We identified the median employee for our 2017 pay ratio using the following methodology: 
 We considered the compensation of 20,270 S&P Global employees (other than the CEO) located worldwide (approximately 25% of whom were located in the United States and 75% of whom were located in jurisdictions outside the United States) as of October 1, 2017. We did not exclude any countries and we did not make any adjustments for cost of living. 
 We used total cash compensation, consisting of total base pay, plus bonus and commission payments, for the trailing 12-month period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 as the compensation measure for identifying our median employee. The compensation measure was consistently applied to all employees across our global workforce. 
 Using this methodology, we determined that the median employee was a full-time, salaried employee located outside the United States who provides services as a junior professional at one of our overseas operations sites in the Asia Pacific region. 
SEC rules permit us to identify the median employee only once every three years, unless there have been changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change in our pay ratio disclosure. There has been no change in our employee population or 
       2019 Proxy Statement       95
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES (continued)
​
employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. As a result, we decided to use the same median employee that we identified for our 2017 pay ratio disclosure. 
In determining our 2018 pay ratio, we calculated the median employee's annual total compensation in the same manner as the named executive officers in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" beginning on page 85 and used an average rate of exchange from local currency to U.S. dollars for the 12-month period ending on December 31, 2018. 
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to exclude up to 5% of the workforce, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, our pay ratio may not be comparable to the ratio reported by other companies, as other companies have different employee populations, geographic locations, business strategies and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control
The NEOs may be eligible to receive certain payments and benefits under our severance, incentive and retirement plans in connection with the named executive officer's termination of employment or a change-in-control. Described below are the specific events that would trigger the payments and benefits, and the estimated payments and benefits that would be provided to the named executive officers upon the occurrence of these events. 
Severance Plans
Senior Executive Severance
The NEOs are eligible for severance benefits under our Senior Executive Severance Plan upon the occurrence of the following triggering events: 
 the Company terminates the executive's employment other than for cause; 
 the executive resigns due to an adverse change in the executive's functions, duties or responsibilities that would cause the executive's position to have substantially less responsibility, importance or scope; or 
 the executive resigns due to a reduction of the executive's base salary by 10% or more. 
In addition, the executive will be eligible for severance benefits if the executive resigns following a change-in-control because: 
 the executive's base salary is reduced (other than a reduction of less than 10% as part of a Company wide salary reduction) below the highest rate in effect since the beginning of the 24-month period prior to the change-in-control; 
 the executive's annual or long-term incentive opportunity is materially less favorable than at any time since the beginning of the 24-month period prior to the change-in-control; 
 the aggregate value of the executive's pension and welfare benefits is materially reduced; 
 the executive is required to transfer to a principal business location that increases the distance to the executive's residence by more than 35 miles; 
 there is an adverse change in the executive's title or reporting relationship or an adverse change by the Company in the executive's authority, functions, duties or responsibilities (other than that which results solely from the Company ceasing to have a publicly traded class of common stock or the executive no longer serving as the chief executive, or reporting to the chief executive, of an independent, publicly traded company as a result thereof), which change would cause the executive's position with the Company to become one of substantially less responsibility, importance or scope; or

 a successor to the Company fails to adopt the Plan. 
A termination for "cause" generally means a termination due to misconduct that results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, material damage to the Company's property, business or reputation. 
A "change-in-control" generally means: 
 a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company's voting securities; 
 the members of our Board of Directors, together with persons approved by a majority of those members or persons approved by them, no longer make up a majority of the Board; 
 consummation of a merger or consolidation involving the Company if our voting securities do not represent more than 50% of the outstanding shares and voting power of the company surviving the transaction; or 
 our shareholders approve the liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
A change-in-control by reason of a change in a majority of our Board, as described above, could arise, for example, as a result of a contested election (or elections) in which shareholders elect a majority of the members of the Board from nominees who are not nominated for election by the incumbent Board. 
Under the Plan, as it was in effect as of December 31, 2018, each named executive officer (other than the CEO, whose severance benefits are described below separately) was eligible to receive the following severance benefits upon the occurrence of one of the termination events described above: 
 continued payment of the executive's base salary and participation in the Company's non-qualified retirement, life, medical, dental, accidental death and disability insurance benefit plans during a severance period of 12 months; 
 a lump sum payment at the end of the severance period equal to six months of the executive's base salary; and 
 an additional lump sum severance payment at the end of the severance period equal to 10% of the lump sum payment calculated above in lieu of continued benefits. 
Under the Plan, as it was in effect as of December 31, 2018, the CEO, Mr. Peterson, was eligible to receive the following severance benefits upon the occurrence of one of the termination events described above: 
 continued payment of the executive's base salary and participation in the Company's non-qualified retirement, life, medical, dental, accidental death and disability insurance benefit plans during a severance period of 12 months; 
 a lump sum payment at the end of the severance period equal to 12 months of the executive's base salary; and 
 an additional lump sum severance payment at the end of the severance period equal to 10% of the lump sum payment calculated above in lieu of continued benefits. 
If the triggering event takes place following a change-in-control, then (i) the total severance payments for all named executive officers (including Mr. Peterson) during the 12-month severance period would be equal to the sum of the executive's annual base salary and annual target incentive award, and (ii) the lump sum payment due at the end of the severance period would also be equal to the sum of the executive's annual base salary and annual target incentive award, increased by an amount equal to 10% of the lump sum in lieu of benefits. In each case, to receive the separation pay due under the Plan, the executive would have to sign a general release of claims against the Company. 
General Severance Treatment
In general, if payments under the Senior Executive Severance Plan are considered "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then a deduction to the Company will be disallowed and the executive will be subject to an excise tax equal to 20% of the excess parachute payment amount. Because of the way the excise tax is calculated, in certain circumstances, the executive may receive a larger after-tax amount

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES (continued)
​
(and the Company will be entitled to a larger tax deduction) if the gross amount payable to the executive is reduced. In this case, certain of the executive's payments would be "cut back" to the largest amount that would not result in payment of any excise tax. 
Severance payments to the named executive officers that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code will generally be delayed during the first six months following the executive's termination, as required under Section 409A, and installments that would have otherwise been paid during the six-month delay will be paid in a lump sum following the end of the six-month delay. 
Estimated Severance as of December 31, 2018

Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
The NEOs may receive a portion of their annual incentive award under the Company's Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan if the executive terminates employment because of death, disability or retirement, or if the Company terminates the executive's employment other than for cause. Payments are prorated for the period the executive was employed during the year and are made to the executive in a lump sum on the regular payment date under the Plan. 
If there is a change-in-control, each named executive officer will receive a payment equal to the average of the NEO's annual incentive award payments for the preceding three years, prorated for the period elapsed through the date of the change-in-control. The Company may also pay the executive any additional amount necessary to reflect the actual achievement of the Company performance objectives and individual performance criteria for the executive through the date of the change-in-control.

Stock Incentive Plan
Each of the named executive officers has been granted PSUs, RSUs and/or stock options under the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. These awards are described on pages 88 and 89 of this Proxy Statement. 
Performance Share Units
If the executive terminates employment due to retirement or disability, or in the event of termination of employment by the Company other than for cause, with the approval of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, the executive receives the number of shares that would be payable under the terms of the award based on the actual performance for the performance period, prorated for the period of time during the award cycle that the executive was employed and during which the executive receives separation pay. Delivery of the awarded shares is made in the year following the normal maturity date for the award. 
In the case of the executive's death, the number of shares awarded is based on actual performance for the performance period, prorated for the period of time completed during the award cycle. Delivery of the awarded shares is made by March 15 of the year following the executive's death. 
In the event of a change-in-control during the performance period, if assumed on substantially the same terms and conditions, the PSU awards will convert into an award of time-vesting RSUs with respect to a number of shares determined as follows: if less than 50% of the performance period has elapsed, the number of shares will be based on target performance, and if 50% or more of the performance period has elapsed, the number of shares will be based on actual performance as of the change-in-control. The converted RSUs will then continue to vest pursuant to the original vesting schedule of the PSUs, except that they will vest in full if the executive's employment is terminated due to retirement, disability or death or by the Company without cause. If the awards are not so assumed, they will be deemed to be earned at the higher of target or actual performance as of the change-in-control date, and the award will vest in full.

​
Restricted Stock Units
If the NEO terminates employment due to retirement, disability or death, or, with the approval of the Compensation and Leadership Committee, if the Company terminates the executive other than for cause, the executive is eligible to receive a portion of the shares that are covered by the outstanding RSUs. In the case of the executive's death, delivery of the awarded shares is made within 60 days following the date of the employee's passing. 
In the event of a change-in-control during the vesting period, if assumed on substantially the same terms and conditions, RSUs will roll over into awards of the successor company's stock and will remain outstanding subject to their original vesting terms, except that they will vest in full if the executive's employment is terminated due to retirement, disability or death or by the Company without cause within 24 months following the change-in-control. If RSUs are not so assumed, they will vest in full upon the change-in-control. 
Stock Options
If the named executive officer terminates employment due to death, disability or normal retirement, the executive's stock options will vest in full. In addition, in the case of death, the options will be exercisable for one year following the date of death, and, in the case of disability or retirement, until the end of the option term. If the executive terminates employment due to early retirement, generally, the vesting of the executive's stock options will not accelerate, but, to the extent they are vested at the time of retirement and the executive is 55 or older with 10 years of continuous service, the options will be exercisable until the end of the option term. 
In the event of a change-in-control, all outstanding stock options will vest in full and will either be converted into awards based on the common stock of the surviving company or paid to the executive in cash. Cash payments under options will be equal to the value of the option shares, generally the highest price per share paid in the change-in-control, less the exercise price of the shares. 
Long-Term Cash Awards
S&P Dow Jones Indices Long-Term Cash Awards
If the executive terminates due to retirement or death, the executive receives the dollar value in cash that would be payable under the terms of the award based on actual performance for the performance period, prorated for the number of months during the award cycle that the executive was employed. In the event of termination of employment by the Company other than for cause, with the approval of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, the executive receives the dollar value in cash that would be payable under the terms of the award based on actual performance for the performance period, prorated for the period of time during the award cycle that the executive was employed and during which the executive receives separation pay. Payment of the award is made on or before March 15 in the year following the normal maturity date for the award. In the case of the executive's death, the payment will be made in the year following the executive's death. 
In the event of a change-in-control during the performance period, the Board of the Company may take all actions it may determine necessary or appropriate to treat the executive equitably, including without limitation the modification or waiver of applicable performance measures, the performance period or cash awards.

Overview of Key Best Practices
Our Director compensation program continues to align with long-term shareholder interests, including by the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PRACTICE   ​ ​ ​  COMPANY POLICY   ​ ​ ​  MORE DETAIL   ​ 
​   ✔   ​ ​ ​   Emphasis on Equity Compensation    ​ ​ ​  The most significant portion of non-employee Director compensation is the annual equity grant payable as an annual deferred share award.   ​ ​ ​   Pg. 104   ​ 
​   ✔   ​ ​ ​   Holding Requirement    ​ ​ ​  Our non-employee Directors must hold all equity compensation granted to them in the form of deferred share credits during their tenure until they retire, and shares of the Company's common stock underlying these awards are not delivered until following a Director's termination of Board membership.   ​ ​ ​   Pg. 106   ​ 
​   ✔   ​ ​ ​   Robust Stock Ownership Guidelines    ​ ​ ​  Our Director stock ownership guidelines require Directors to acquire 400 shares of the Company's common stock within 90 days and five times (5x) the cash component of the annual Board retainer within five years of election to the Board.   ​ ​ ​   Pg. 106   ​ 
​   ✔   ​ ​ ​   Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy    ​ ​ ​  Our anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy prohibits Directors from engaging in hedging and pledging transactions related to Company stock.   ​ ​ ​   Pg. 106   ​ 
[END TABLE]
Director Compensation Program
The Company provides annual compensation to non-employee Directors as follows: 
Cash Compensation
The annual cash compensation paid to our non-employee Directors in respect of 2018 was: 
 an annual cash retainer of  $70,000; 
 $1,500 for each Board meeting attended; 
 $1,500 for each Committee meeting attended; 
 an annual cash retainer of  $15,000 to the Chairs of Committees of the Board; and 
 an annual cash retainer of  $150,000 to the non-executive Chairman of the Board. 
Share Compensation
The most significant portion of non-employee Director compensation is the annual equity grant payable as an annual deferred share award. In 2018, each non-employee Director received a deferred share credit of $150,000 pursuant to the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The $150,000 share credit in respect of fiscal year 2018 was credited as 883.13 deferred shares based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on January 2, 2019 of  $169.85. The deferred share credits are payable in shares of the Company's common stock following a Director's termination of Board membership. 
The Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan also permits Directors to elect to receive all or part of their annual cash compensation in deferred shares of common stock in lieu of the cash payments. For 2019, the Company has written agreements with Messrs. Green, Haldeman and Schmoke to receive all or part of their 2019 cash payments as deferred shares. 
104       2019 Proxy Statement       
TABLE OF CONTENTS​
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION (continued)​
​
Other Director Plans and Other Compensation
In addition, Directors may elect to defer all or part of their annual cash compensation under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. For 2019, the Company has written agreements to defer cash payments under this Plan with Messrs. Schmoke and Thornburgh. Interest is payable on the deferred cash amount at 120% of the applicable Federal Long-Term Rate, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in December of the year prior to the year in which the Director compensation is credited. 
Our non-employee Directors are also reimbursed for tuition and related expenses for continuing director education courses. Mr. Schmoke and Ms. Morris were reimbursed for tuition expenses in 2018. 
As discussed on pages 79 and 79 of this Proxy Statement, our Directors are eligible to participate in our director charitable matching program with respect to contributions made to the S&P Global PAC. Under the S&P Global PAC program, the Company contributes funds to a charitable organization of the Director's choice that match the Director's contribution to the S&P Global PAC, up to a maximum of  $5,000 per annum. In 2018, the Company made matching charitable contributions under the S&P Global PAC program for Messrs. Rust and Schmoke. 
Additionally, our Directors may participate in the charitable S&P Global Matching Gift Program, up to a maximum participant donation of  $5,000 (or the currency equivalent) in the aggregate per year. In 2018, the Company elected to double the corporate matched contribution for charitable contributions made during certain periods of the year to a corporate match of up to $10,000 in the aggregate. This program is generally available to all our employees and Directors as well as retired employees or directors for up to three years following their retirement.
2019 Non-Employee Director Compensation Design Changes
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, comprised of independent Directors, periodically reviews the competitiveness of the Company's non-employee Director compensation based on pay practices among the Company's Proxy Peer Group, as described on page 60 of this Proxy Statement, and broader general industry practices for similarly sized companies in the S&P 500. The Committee recommends any changes to the Director compensation program in connection with its review to the Board. 
During 2018, the Committee engaged Pay Governance LLC, an independent compensation consultant, to review director compensation survey data and advise the Committee on changes, if any, to non-employee Director compensation. Based on the Committee's review of the competitive market analysis and advice of Pay Governance, the Committee recommended replacing all Board and Committee meeting fees with a retainer-based pay design constructed to deliver market competitive total pay at median compensation levels and recognize the different service requirements of each Committee with standard Committee member retainers. 
As a result of the Committee's recommendation, the Board approved the following changes to take effect for Board service in fiscal year 2019: 
 Eliminated fees paid for attendance at Board and Committee meetings 
 Increased the annual cash retainer from $70,000 to $90,000 to compensate for elimination of Board meeting fees 
 Maintained the annual cash retainer of  $15,000 for Committee Chairs 
 Introduced an annual cash retainer for Committee members at the following levels: 
◦
$15,000 for Audit Committee members
​
◦
$10,000 for Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members
​
◦
$12,000 for Financial Policy Committee members
​
 Increased the annual equity grant from $150,000 to $160,000, subject to shareholder approval of the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as Amended and Restated, at the Annual Meeting.
       2019 Proxy Statement       105
TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION (continued)
​
We are also asking shareholders to approve an Amended and Restated Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, which increases the value of the annual deferred share award from $150,000 to $160,000 and introduces meaningful, annual limits on future increases to Director stock awards under the Plan. 
See "Item Four — Proposal to approve of the Company's Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as Amended and Restated" beginning on page 121 of this Proxy Statement for more details regarding these and other plan changes. 
We believe the changes to total Director compensation preserve our program's emphasis on deferred equity compensation, which aligns the interests of our Directors with the financial performance of the Company and promotes long-term shareholder value. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
Under the Company's By-Laws, each Director is required to own or acquire 400 shares of the Company's common stock within 90 days of his or her election to the Board and to hold such shares through his or her entire tenure as a Director. Additionally, under the Company's Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines, each non-employee Director is required to own or acquire, within five years of election to the Company's Board of Directors, shares of common stock of the Company (including deferred share units held under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan) having a market value of at least five times (5x) the annual cash retainer for serving as a Director of the Company at all times during his or her tenure. 
Based on the holdings of shares and deferred share units under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as of February 26, 2019, each Director was in compliance with the minimum holding requirement under the Company's Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines (taking into account the applicable five-year transition period). 
The full policy can be viewed and downloaded from the Corporate Governance section of the Company's Investor Relations website at http://investor.spglobal.com. 
Insider Trading Policy
Under the Company's Insider Trading Policy, Directors, executive officers and other designated employees are prohibited without exception from pledging Company stock as well as from engaging in hedging transactions related to Company stock, such as puts, calls, swaps, collars and other arrangements intended to hedge exposure to Company stock or provide protection against declines in the value of Company stock. None of our Directors has shares of Company stock subject to a pledge.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee (the "Committee") reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. All of the members of the Committee are independent Directors as defined in the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The Board has adopted a written Charter for the Audit Committee. 
In this context, the Committee has met and held discussions with management and the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"). Management represented to the Committee that it is responsible for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, for the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and for the report on the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and EY, which review included a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Committee also discussed with management the process used to support the certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and to support management's annual report on the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Committee discussed with EY the integrated audit results as required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), rules of the SEC, and other applicable regulations. 
In addition, the Committee has reviewed and discussed with EY the firm's independence from the Company and its management. The Committee received from EY the written disclosures and the letter regarding its independence as required by the PCAOB's applicable requirements. 
The Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of EY for the purposes of preparing or issuing the audit report or performing the audit of the Company. The Committee has also considered whether the provision of services by EY not related to the audit of the financial statements is compatible with maintaining EY's independence. The Committee pre-approves all fees for services provided by EY. 
The Committee evaluates EY's performance, taking into consideration the following factors: management's perception of expertise and past performance, external data relating to audit quality, independence, appropriateness of fees, global reach relative to the Company's business, tenure as our independent auditor and familiarity with our operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices and system of internal controls. The Committee periodically reviews and evaluates the performance of EY's lead audit partner, ensures the audit partner rotation as required by law and, through the Committee Chair as representative of the Committee, reviews and considers the selection of the lead audit partner. 
The Committee discussed with EY the overall scope and plans for its respective audits. The Committee met with the internal auditors and EY, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC. The Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of EY to serve as the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and have recommended that shareholders ratify the appointment of EY as the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019.

Item 2. Proposal to Approve, on an Advisory Basis, the Executive Compensation Program for the Company's Named Executive Officers
Under the rules of the SEC, the Company is required to provide its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the executive compensation program for the Company's named executive officers. This proposal is frequently referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, shareholders voted, on an advisory basis, in favor of casting the advisory say-on-pay vote on an annual basis. 
The Company's executive compensation program is intended to attract, motivate and reward the executive talent required to achieve our corporate objectives and increase shareholder value. We believe that our executive compensation program is both competitive and strongly focused on pay-for-performance principles, and provides an appropriate balance between risk and rewards. In particular, our executive compensation program: 
 aligns compensation with shareholder value on an annual and long-term basis through a combination of base pay, annual cash incentives and long-term stock-based incentives; 
 includes a mix of compensation elements that emphasizes performance results, with approximately 90% of the 2018 targeted compensation for Douglas L. Peterson, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and a significant portion of the targeted compensation for the other named executive officers being performance-based; 
 delivers annual incentive payouts to executives based on the achievement of approved quantitative performance goals, which were based on ICP Adjusted EBITA Margin and ICP Adjusted Revenue enterprise-level Company goals and, as appropriate, for our division leaders, division-level goals for 2018; 
 aligns the interests of executives with those of shareholders through long-term stock-based incentives comprised of Performance Share Units that are based on the achievement of ICP Adjusted EPS targets. For 2018, the Performance Share Unit award vests at the end of a three-year award cycle, with payment ranging up to a maximum of 200% of the shares based on the achievement of compound annual diluted EPS growth goals; and 
 has features designed to further align executive compensation with shareholder interests and mitigate risks, including stock ownership requirements, the Senior Executive Pay Recovery Policy (a "clawback" policy), an anti-hedging and pledging policy and limited perquisites. 
Our executive compensation program is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), related compensation tables and other narrative executive compensation disclosures required by the disclosure rules of the SEC, all of which are found in this Proxy Statement. In particular, the CD&A, beginning on page 50 of this Proxy Statement, describes the Company's executive compensation program in detail, and we encourage you to review it. 
Since the vote on this proposal is advisory, it is not binding on the Company. Nonetheless, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, which is responsible for approving the overall design and administering certain aspects of the executive compensation program, will take into account the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. The Board of Directors recommends that you approve the following resolution that will be submitted for a shareholder vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting in support of the Company's executive compensation program: 
RESOLVED: That the shareholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the executive compensation program for the Company's named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, related compensation tables and other narrative executive compensation disclosures included in the Proxy Statement for this Annual Meeting.

Item 3. Proposal to Approve the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan
Introduction
The Board is seeking shareholder approval of the S&P Global Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is intended to replace the Company's existing equity compensation plan, the S&P Global Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the "2002 Plan"), which was previously approved by shareholders. 
In designing the Plan, our Board and our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (our "Compensation Committee") carefully considered our anticipated future equity needs, our historical equity compensation practices (including our historical "burn rate" under the 2002 Plan) and the advice of our Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. The aggregate number of shares being requested for authorization under the Plan pursuant to awards granted after the Plan's approval is 20 million shares, which represents a reduction from the number of shares that remain available for issuance under the current 2002 Plan (which, as of December 31, 2018, was 33.3 million shares). If the Plan is approved by shareholders, the Plan will replace the 2002 Plan, and no additional grants will be made under the 2002 Plan. 
If the Plan is not approved by shareholders, the 2002 Plan will remain in effect in its current form, and we will continue to grant equity incentive awards under the 2002 Plan until its expiration on April 28, 2020 or such earlier date as determined by our Board. Following the expiration of the 2002 Plan, we will be unable to maintain our current equity grant practices, and therefore we will be at a significant competitive disadvantage in attracting, retaining and motivating talented individuals who contribute to our success. 
As of December 31, 2018, under all of our equity compensation plans, we had outstanding: 
 stock options covering 1,652,682 shares of our common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of  $47.92 and a weighted average remaining term of 3.3 years; and
 restricted stock awards and units (including performance units) covering 1,364,664 shares of our common stock.
Considerations for the Approval of the Plan
The Plan has been designed to build upon the effectiveness of the 2002 Plan and incorporates additional corporate governance best practices to further align our equity compensation program with the interests of our shareholders. Certain of the corporate governance best practices included in our Plan are as follows: 
✔
Minimum vesting requirements. The Plan requires awards to be subject to a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant, with only narrow exceptions, which we believe strengthens our employees' interest in creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
​
✔
Restricted dividends and dividend equivalents on awards. The Plan prohibits the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents in respect of an award prior to the time such award (or the applicable portion thereof) vests (and, in the case of performance awards, the applicable performance condition is achieved). 
​
✔
No repricings. Repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") is not permitted without shareholder approval, except for adjustments with respect to certain specified extraordinary corporate transactions. 
​
✔
No "liberal" share counting provisions. Shares underlying any award granted under the Plan that are forfeited, expired, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash or property other than shares are added back to the share reserve; however, shares that are withheld to satisfy the exercise price of an award or any applicable tax withholding obligations or repurchased by the Company with option proceeds are not added back to the share reserve.
​

​
✔
Clawback of awards. The Plan provides the Compensation Committee with the authority to subject awards granted under the Plan to any clawback or recoupment policies that the Company has in effect from time to time (including our recoupment policy, as described in more detail on page 82 of this proxy statement). 
​
✔
Share ownership guidelines. Our executive officers (including all of our NEOs) and directors are subject to share ownership guidelines to ensure that they face the same downside risk and upside potential as our shareholders. For additional details regarding our share ownership guidelines, see page 81 of this Proxy Statement.
​
Summary of the Plan
The following is a summary of the principal features of the Plan. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Plan. A copy of the Plan has been filed with the SEC with this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. 
Purpose
The purpose of the Plan is to enable the Company to offer its employees and other individual service providers long-term equity-based incentives in the Company, thereby attracting, retaining and rewarding such individuals, and strengthening the mutuality of interests between such individuals and the Company's shareholders. 
Eligibility
Our employees, individual consultants, advisors and other service providers are eligible to receive awards under the Plan based on the Compensation Committee's determination, in its sole discretion, that an award to such individual will further the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan's stated purpose (as described above). As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 883 employees and 0 individual consultants, advisors and other service providers eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. 
Authorized Shares
Subject to adjustment (as described below), the number of common shares that may be subject to awards granted under the Plan is 20 million, and the number of common shares that may be subject to incentive stock options granted under the Plan is 20 million. If an award expires or is canceled or forfeited, or is otherwise settled without the issuance of shares, the shares covered by the award will again be available for issuance under the Plan. Shares (i) tendered or withheld in payment of an exercise or purchase price, (ii) surrendered or withheld in payment of taxes related to an award or (iii) repurchased by the Company with option proceeds in respect of the exercise of an stock option awarded under the Plan will not again be available for issuance under the Plan. Shares underlying replacement awards (i.e., awards granted as replacements for awards granted by a company that we acquire or with which we combine) will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. 
Administration
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, but the Board may, in its sole discretion, administer or grant wards pursuant to the Plan from time to time. 
The Compensation Committee has authority under the Plan to: 
 designate participants; 
 determine the types of awards to grant, the number of shares to be covered by awards, the terms and conditions of awards, whether awards may be settled or exercised in cash, shares, other awards, other property or net settlement, the circumstances under which awards may be canceled, repurchased, forfeited or suspended, and whether awards may be deferred automatically, or at the election of the holder or the Compensation Committee; 
 amend the terms of any outstanding awards; 
 correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any award agreement, in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into effect;
       2019 Proxy Statement       115
TABLE OF CONTENTS
ITEMS OF BUSINESS TO BE ACTED ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING (continued)
​
 interpret and administer the Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or award made under, the Plan; and 
 make any other determination and take any other action that it deems necessary or desirable to administer the Plan, in each case, as it deems appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan and compliance with applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations. 
The Compensation Committee may delegate the authority to grant awards under the Plan, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to (i) one or more officers of the Company (except that such delegation will not be applicable to any award for a person then covered by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) and (ii) one or more members of the Compensation Committee. 
Types of Awards
The Plan provides for grants of stock options (both nonqualified and incentive stock options), SARs, restricted stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards. Any award may be granted alone or in tandem with other awards, and may be granted in addition to, or in substitution for, other types of awards. 
Stock Options. A stock option is a contractual right to purchase shares at a future date at a specified exercise price. The per share exercise price of a stock option will be determined by the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The Compensation Committee will determine the date after which each stock option may be exercised, the method and form by which each option is to be exercised, and the expiration date of each option, provided that no option will be exercisable before the first anniversary of and more than ten years after the grant date. Options intended to be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code may not be granted to any person who is not an employee of us or any parent or subsidiary, as defined in Section 424 of the Code. There have not yet been any options granted under the Plan, and so there are no options outstanding under the Plan. 
SARs. SARs represent a contractual right to receive, in cash or shares, an amount equal to the appreciation of one share from the grant date. The terms and conditions applicable to stock options also apply to SARs. 
Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock is an award of shares that are subject to restrictions on transfer and a substantial risk of forfeiture. 
Performance Awards. Performance awards, which may be denominated in cash or shares, will be earned on the satisfaction of performance goals specified by the Compensation Committee, provided that the period during which performance goals must be achieved cannot be shorter than one year. 
Other Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee is authorized to grant other stock-based awards that are payable in cash or the Company's common stock and are valued in whole or in part by reference to such stock, including restricted stock units, phantom stock and similar units. 
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents
Awards granted under the Plan may not provide for any dividend or dividend equivalents to be payable to the participant in respect of such award prior to the time such award (or the applicable portion thereof) vests (and, in the case of performance awards, the applicable performance condition is achieved). 
Minimum Vesting Requirements
Each award granted pursuant to the Plan will vest over a period of not less than one year following the date of grant. However, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of an award or otherwise lapse or waive this requirement upon the participant's death, disability or a change-in-control. In addition, the Compensation Committee may grant awards that are not subject to these minimum vesting requirements with respect to 5% of the maximum aggregate number of shares in the Company's common stock available for issuance under the Plan (as may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Plan).

​
Adjustments
In the event the Compensation Committee determines that, as a result of any dividend or other distribution (other than an ordinary dividend or distribution), merger, reorganization, consolidation, separation, rights offering, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of the Company's common stock or other securities of the Company, or other corporate transaction or event or change in corporate structure affecting the Company's common stock, including any equity restructuring within the meaning of applicable accounting standards, an adjustment is appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, the Compensation Committee will adjust equitably any or all of: (i) the number and type of shares or other securities that thereafter may be made the subject of awards, including the aggregate limit under the Plan; (ii) the number and type of shares or other securities subject to outstanding awards; and (iii) the grant, purchase, exercise or hurdle price for any award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding award. 
Change-in-Control
In the event of a change-in-control, awards will be treated as follows, except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee or provided in the applicable award documentation: 
 for stock options, SARs, restricted stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards that have been assumed or substituted by the successor company with substantially the same terms and conditions, if the holder's employment with the Company or the successor company is terminated without cause within 24 months of the change-in-control, the awards will become fully exercisable and vested as of the termination date; 
 for stock options, SARs, restricted stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards that have not been assumed or substituted by the successor company with substantially the same terms and conditions, they will become fully exercisable and vested as of the date of the change-in-control; and 
 for performance awards, to the extent the successor company (or a subsidiary or a parent thereof) assumes or provides a substitute for performance awards outstanding under the Plan, such performance awards will convert into time-vesting restricted stock or unit awards, as applicable, with otherwise substantially the same terms and conditions (x) at target, to the extent less than 50% of the applicable performance period has been completed or (y) based on performance through the date of such change-in-control, to the extent 50% or more of the applicable performance period has been completed.
A change-in-control generally means (i) the acquisition of 20% or more of the Company's common stock or combined voting power of voting securities; (ii) a change in the composition of the Board such that the incumbent directors cease to constitute a majority of the Board; (iii) a reorganization, merger or consolidation or a disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iv) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
Amendment and Termination
Our Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan, subject to approval of our shareholders if required by the rules of the stock exchange on which our shares are principally traded. The Compensation Committee may amend any outstanding award. However, no such board or committee action that would materially adversely affect the rights of a holder of an outstanding award may be taken without the holder's consent, except to the extent that such action is taken to cause the Plan to comply with applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations. 
Prohibition on Repricing
Subject to the adjustment provision described above, the Compensation Committee may not directly or indirectly, through cancellation or regrant or any other method, reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the exercise or hurdle price of any award established at the time of grant without approval of our shareholders.

Cancellation or "Clawback" of Awards
The Compensation Committee may, to the extent permitted by applicable law and stock exchange rules or by any of our policies (including our recoupment policy, as described in more detail on page 82 of this Proxy Statement), cancel or require reimbursement of any awards granted, shares issued or cash received upon the vesting, exercise or settlement of any awards granted under the Plan or the sale of shares underlying such awards. 
Term
The Plan expires 10 years after the date of the Annual Meeting unless earlier terminated by the Board at its discretion. 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of Equity Awards
The following is a general summary under current law of certain United States federal income tax consequences to the Company and participants who are citizens or individual residents of the United States relating to awards granted under the Plan. This summary deals with the general tax principles that apply to such awards and is provided only for general information. Certain kinds of taxes, such as foreign taxes, state and local income taxes, payroll taxes and the alternative minimum tax, are not discussed. This summary is not tax advice and it does not discuss all aspects of federal taxation that may be relevant to the Company and participants. Accordingly, the Company urges each participant to consult his or her own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences of participation in the Plan under federal, state, local and other applicable laws. In addition, the Company may be subject to limits on tax deductibility relating to compensation described herein under certain statutory provisions, including Sections 162(m) and 280G of the Code. 
Non-Qualified Stock Options
A non-qualified stock option is an option that does not meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income when granted a non-qualified stock option. When the participant exercises the stock option, he or she generally will recognize taxable ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares received on the exercise date over the aggregate exercise price of the shares. The participant's tax basis in the shares acquired on exercise of the option will be increased by the amount of such taxable income. We generally will be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction. When the participant sells the shares acquired on exercise, the participant generally will realize long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on whether the participant holds the shares for more than one year before selling them. 
Incentive Stock Options
An incentive stock option or "ISO" is an option that meets the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. A participant will not have taxable income when granted an ISO or when exercising an ISO. If a participant exercises an ISO and does not dispose of the shares until the later of two years after the grant date and one year after the exercise date, the entire gain, if any, realized when the participant sells the shares will be taxable as long-term capital gain. However, even though a participant will not have taxable income when exercising an ISO, the exercise of an ISO is taken into account for purposes of determining whether the participant has any alternative minimum tax liability (described below). We generally will not be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction. 
If a participant disposes of the shares received upon exercise of an ISO within the one-year or two-year periods described above, it will be considered a "disqualifying disposition." Under such circumstances, the participant generally will realize ordinary income in the year of the disposition, and we generally will be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction. The amounts of the participant's ordinary income and the Company's deduction will equal the excess of the lesser of the amount, if any, realized on the disposition and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date over the aggregate exercise price of the ISO. Any

​
additional gain or loss that the participant realizes on the disposition will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on whether the participant holds the shares for more than one year before selling them. 
If a participant exercises an ISO more than three months after the participant's employment with the Company terminates, the option will be treated as a non-qualified stock option for federal income tax purposes. If a participant is disabled and terminates employment because of his or her disability, the three-month period is extended to one year. The three-month period does not apply in the case of a participant's death. 
SARs
A participant does not recognize income at the time a SAR is granted. A participant will recognize income at the time cash or stock representing the amount of the appreciation is transferred to the participant pursuant to exercise of a SAR. The amount of income will equal the amount of cash or fair market value of shares paid or transferred to the participant and will be ordinary income. We generally will be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction. 
Restricted Stock
Unless a participant makes an election to accelerate recognition of the income to the date of grant as described below, the participant generally will not recognize income, and we generally will not be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction at the time restricted stock is granted. When the restrictions lapse, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares as of that date, less any amount paid for the restricted stock, and we generally will be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time. If the participant files an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days after the date of grant of the restricted stock, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income as of the date of grant equal to the fair market value of the common shares as of that date, less any amount the participant paid for the restricted stock, and we generally will be entitled to a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time. Any future appreciation in the shares generally will be taxable to the participant at capital gains rates. However, if the restricted stock is later forfeited, the participant generally will not be able to recover the tax previously paid pursuant to his Section 83(b) election. 
Registration With the SEC
If our shareholders approve the Plan, we plan to file a registration statement on a Form S-8 (and/or an amendment to our existing registration statement that has been filed with respect to the 2002 Plan) with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after such approval, to register the shares available for issuance under the Plan. 
New Plan Benefits
As described above, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, will select the participants who receive awards and the size and types of those awards under the Plan, if the Plan is approved by our shareholders. Therefore, the awards that will be made to particular individuals or groups of individuals in the future under the Plan are not currently determinable. See the "Summary Compensation" Table and the "Grant of Plan Based Awards" Table on pages 85 and 88 of this Proxy Statement, respectively, which set forth certain information regarding awards granted to our named executive officers during 2018 under the 2002 Plan.

Item 4. Proposal to Approve the Company's Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as Amended and Restated
Introduction
The Board is seeking shareholder approval to amend and restate the S&P Global Inc. Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan (the "Director Plan") to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Director Plan and to modify certain terms of the Director Plan to better align with Company policies and objectives. Specifically, if approved by our shareholders, the Director Plan will be amended primarily as follows: 
 The number of shares available for issuance under the Director Plan will be increased by 500,000 shares over the number of shares available for issuance under the Director Plan as of immediately prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. As of December 31, 2018, there were 32,622 shares that remained available for issuance under the Director Plan. 
 The value of the annual stock award granted to each non-employee director under the Director Plan will be increased from $150,000 to $160,000, and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Committee") will be permitted to increase this amount on a limited basis by up to $25,000 during the term of the Director Plan (unlike the current plan under which the Committee had the flexibility to designate any other stock award amount in its discretion). 
In connection with the proposed amendment and restatement of the Director Plan, our Board and the Committee carefully considered our anticipated future equity needs. If the proposed amendment and restatement of the Director Plan is not approved by our shareholders, we will be unable to maintain our current non-employee director equity compensation practices, and therefore we will be at a significant competitive disadvantage in attracting, retaining and motivating talented directors who contribute to our success. We also believe that the limits on director stock awards and the limited discretion of the Committee to increase the amount of such awards are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in line with evolving best practices regarding director compensation. 
Considerations for Approval of Amended and Restated Director Plan
The amended and restated Director Plan has been designed to build upon the effectiveness of the existing Director Plan and incorporates corporate governance best practices to further align our non-employee director compensation program with the interests of our shareholders. The following is a list of some of the primary factors to be considered by shareholders in connection with approving the amended and restated Director Plan: 
 Governance Best Practices. The amended and restated Director Plan incorporates the following corporate governance best practices that protect the interests of our shareholders: 
✔
Individual limits. Non-employee director participants are subject to meaningful, annual limits on their stock compensation. Limited discretion. The Committee has very limited discretion to increase the annual limits on director stock compensation. 
​
✔
No evergreen provision. The amended and restated Director Plan does not contain an "evergreen" feature pursuant to which the shares authorized for issuance can be increased automatically without shareholder approval. 
​
✔
Stock ownership guidelines. Non-employee directors serving on our Board are subject to stock ownership guidelines. For additional details regarding our share ownership guidelines, see page 106 of this Proxy Statement. 
​
 Attract and Retain Talented Directors. Approving the amended and restated Director Plan will enable us to continue to recruit, retain and motivate top talent to serve on our Board and will provide the Company with invaluable guidance necessary to our success. 
Overview of Non-Employee Director Compensation
For a summary of current non-employee director compensation and the compensation paid to our non-employee directors in 2018, see the "2018 Director Compensation Table" on page 102 and the "Director Compensation and Governance" section on pages 104 through 106 of this Proxy Statement.

Summary of the Amended and Restated Director Plan
The following is a summary of the principal features of the amended and restated Director Plan. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the amended and restated Director Plan. A copy of the amended and restated Director Plan has been filed with the SEC with this Proxy Statement as Appendix B. 
Purpose
The purpose of the amended and restated Director Plan is to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as non-employee directors, to enhance the equity interest of non-employee directors in the Company, to align the interests of its non-employee directors and shareholders, and to encourage the highest level of non-employee director performance by providing non-employee directors with a proprietary interest in the Company's performance and progress, by crediting them annually with shares of common stock. 
Participants
All regular, active and non-employee directors will participate in the amended and restated Director Plan. Individuals who were participants in the existing Director Plan immediately prior to its amendment and restatement will continue to participate in the amended and restated Director Plan. 
As of December 31, 2018, 11 directors were eligible to participate in the amended and restated Director Plan. 
Authorized Shares
Subject to adjustments (as described below), the maximum number of shares of common stock available to be credited under the amended and restated Director Plan is 500,000, plus the number of shares available for issuance under the existing Director Plan as of immediately prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. 
Administration
The amended and restated Director Plan is administered by the Company's Executive Vice President, Human Resources (the "Plan Administrator"), who has the authority to: 
 establish, amend, suspend, waive and rescind rules and regulations of the amended and restated Director Plan; and 
 make any other determination and take any other action that he or she deems necessary or desirable to administer the amended and restated Director Plan. 
The decisions of the Plan Administrator are subject to the review of the Committee, which also has the authority to amend, interpret and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations of the amended and restated Director Plan and decide or resolve any questions that may arise in connection with the amended and restated Director Plan, including the interpretation of the amended and restated Director Plan. 
Awards and Elections
The Plan Administrator maintains a deferred stock account for each participant to keep track of the total number of shares of common stock credited to each participant. Each year, a participant is credited with shares of common stock having an aggregate value of  $160,000, pro-rated for the period during the year that he or she was a participant (the "Stock Amount"). The Committee has the discretion to increase the value of the Stock Amount by up to $25,000 over the course of the plan term. The participant may also, by irrevocable election, defer all or part of his or her cash compensation for services as a director in exchange for shares of common stock (the "Election Amount"). The sum of the participant's Stock Amount and Election Amount is increased on 
122       2019 Proxy Statement

ITEMS OF BUSINESS TO BE ACTED ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING (continued)​
​
an annual basis by the number of shares equal in value to dividends that would otherwise be distributed to the participant if he or she holds the shares credited in his or her deferred stock account. 
Shares in a participant's deferred stock account are distributed to the participant whenever he or she ceases to be a director for any reason, either in a lump sum or, if the participant has made an election previously, in equal annual installments over a period of up to five years. 
If shares of the Company's common stock are converted into another kind or form of property, including cash, a participant's incidents of ownership and other entitlements with respect to the shares in his or her deferred stock account will continue to the converted property. 
Adjustments
In the event that the Committee determines that, as a result of any dividend or other distribution (other than any ordinary dividend or distribution), merger, reorganization, consolidation, separation, rights offering, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of the Company's common stock or other securities, or other corporate transaction or event, or change in corporate structure affecting the common stock, including any equity restructuring, an adjustment is appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the amended and restated Director Plan, the Board will adjust equitably, so as to ensure no undue enrichment or harm, the number of shares subject to the amended and restated Director Plan and the number of shares held in each participant's deferred stock account. 
Change-in-Control
In the event of a change-in-control in the Company, the Company will immediately pay each participant, in a lump sum, consideration received in the change-in-control for each share of the Company's common stock multiplied by the number of shares held in the participant's deferred stock account immediately before the change-in-control. In addition, the amended and restated Director Plan will be terminated with respect to each participant's deferred stock account. 
A change-in-control generally means (i) the acquisition of 20% or more of the Company's common stock or combined voting power of voting securities; (ii) a change in the composition of the Board such that the incumbent directors cease to constitute a majority of the Board; (iii) a reorganization, merger or consolidation or a disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or (iv) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
Amendments and Termination
The Board or the Committee may amend the amended and restated Director Plan from time to time without the approval of shareholders, except to the extent required by applicable stock exchange rules. The Board or the Committee may also terminate the amended and restated Director Plan at any time. Absent express written consent from an affected participant, no amendment or termination of the amended and restated Director Plan may adversely affect the interest of any participant in shares previously credited to his or her deferred stock account. 
Term
The amended and restated Director Plan will be effective on the date of shareholder approval, and will remain effective until the earlier of the ten-year anniversary of the effective date of the plan, the plan's termination by the Board or the exhaustion of the maximum number of shares available to be credited under the terms of the amended and restated Director Plan.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
A participant will not realize taxable income at the time that shares are credited to the participant's deferred stock account under the amended and restated Director Plan. A participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares that are credited to the participant's deferred stock account at the time that such shares are distributed to the participant. Upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the shares, any gain or loss recognized in the sale or exchange is treated as a capital gain or loss (short-term or long-term depending on the applicable holding period). 
New Plan Benefits
The table below sets forth the new plan benefits that would have been received by participants under the amended and restated Director Plan if the amended and restated Director Plan had been in effect during the Company's prior fiscal year.

to determine whether and to what extent the individual types of Awards (including Replacement Awards) are to be granted to one or more eligible individuals;

(iv)
to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award (including, but not limited to the share price, any restriction or limitation, including any restrictive covenant, the granting of Dividend Equivalents, or any vesting acceleration or forfeiture waiver or any recoupment provision, based on such factors as the Committee shall determine); 
​
(v)

​
(b)
Authority to Construe and Interpret.   Subject to Section 11 hereof, the Committee shall have the authority to adopt, alter and repeal such administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan as it shall, from time to time, deem advisable; to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any Award (and any agreements relating thereto); and to otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.

​
(ii)
in the case of Awards granted in tandem with each other, shares of Stock in excess of the number of shares of Stock issuable thereunder; or

Appendix A (continued)
​
(whether by way of merger, sale and purchase of shares or other securities or otherwise), appropriately adjusted to reflect the acquisition or combination transaction. 
The Aggregate Limit shall be increased by the number of shares of Stock that is forfeited, expired, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash or property other than Stock, or otherwise not distributable, under an Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all shares of Stock that are (i) tendered or withheld to pay the exercise or purchase price of an Award; or (ii) withheld by the Company to satisfy any applicable wage or other required tax withholding obligation; or (iii) repurchased by the Company with the option proceeds (determined under generally accepted accounting principles) in respect of the exercise of a Stock Option shall not again be available for issuance under the Plan. 
(c)
Adjustments for Certain Transactions.   In the event that, as a result of any dividend or other distribution (other than an ordinary dividend or distribution), merger, reorganization, consolidation, separation, rights offering, recapitalization, Stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of Stock or other securities of the Company, or other corporate transaction or event, or change in corporate structure affecting the Stock, including any equity restructuring within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718-Stock Compensation (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment), and the applicable guidance and interpretations thereunder, or any successor thereto, an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, subject to applicable law, adjust equitably so as to ensure no undue enrichment or harm, (including, without limitation, by payment in cash) any of: 
​
(i)
the number and type of shares of Stock (or other securities) which thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, including the aggregate limit specified in Section 3(a); 
​
(ii)
the number and type of shares of Stock (or other securities) subject to outstanding Awards; and 
​
(iii)
the grant, purchase, exercise or hurdle price with respect to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award. 
​
(d)

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan that terminate, expire, or are cancelled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without having been exercised, vested, or paid in shares under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan will no longer be available for issuance under either the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2019 Plan after the 2019 Plan Effective Date. 
​
(e)
Minimum Vesting.   Except with respect to five percent of the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan or Replacement Awards, the minimum vesting period applicable to all Awards (or any portion of an Award) shall be no less than one year from the date of grant, and no Award which vests on the basis of attainment of performance conditions shall provide for a Performance Period of less than one year (the "Minimum Vesting Period"); provided, however, that such limitations shall not preclude the acceleration of vesting of an Award prior to the completion of the Minimum Vesting Period upon the death or Disability of the Participant, or in connection with a Change of Control or a Participant's termination of employment thereafter. 
​
(f)
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.   In the event an Award entitles the recipient to receive dividends or Dividend Equivalents in respect of the underlying shares subject to the Award, any such dividends or Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid currently, but may be deferred or reinvested in additional shares of Stock, in the discretion of the Committee, and shall be subject to the same vesting and/or 
​
​

TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​​​
Appendix A (continued)​
​
performance conditions, restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the underlying shares subject to the Award. In no event may any dividends or Dividend Equivalents be distributed or paid to the Participant in respect of any Award before the underlying shares subject to the Award have become vested. All dividends and Dividend Equivalents shall be paid, if at all, and with or without interest or other earnings, at the time(s) determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
(g)
Replacement Awards.   In connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with the Company or the acquisition by the Company of property or stock of an entity, the Committee may grant Replacement Awards in substitution for any equity or equity-based awards granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof. Replacement Awards may be granted on such terms as the Committee deems appropriate in the circumstances, notwithstanding any limitations on Awards contained in the Plan.

​

original terms. To the extent the successor company (or a subsidiary or a parent thereof) does not so assume or substitute the outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Options, as applicable, on substantially the same terms and conditions, any such outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Options not previously exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested as of the date of such Change in Control; provided, that in such case only, the Committee may cancel such Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Options without the payment of consideration therefor, in the case of any Stock Appreciation Rights or Stock Options with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the Change in Control Price. 
(ii)
To the extent the successor company (or a subsidiary or parent thereof) assumes or substitutes the outstanding Performance Awards, such Performance Awards shall be assumed as or substituted for time-vesting restricted stock awards or units, as applicable, with the number of shares subject to such awards converted (x) at target, to the extent less than 50% of the applicable performance period has been completed or (y) based on actual performance through the date of such Change in Control, to the extent 50% or more of the applicable performance period has been completed, in each case, on otherwise substantially the same terms and conditions (with appropriate adjustments pursuant to Section 3(c) to preserve the value of the Awards), and shall vest and pay out as provided under the terms of the applicable Award Documentation; provided, however, that, if within 24 months following the date of such Change in Control the Participant's employment with the Company or the successor company (or a subsidiary or a parent thereof) is terminated without Cause, such Participant's assumed or substituted and outstanding Performance Awards not previously vested or earned shall become fully vested as of such date. To the extent the successor company (or a subsidiary or parent thereof) does not assume or substitute the outstanding Performance Awards on the terms described above, then such Performance Awards, to the extent not previously vested or earned, shall be deemed fully vested and earned as of the date of such Change in Control, subject to and as provided under (including with respect to payment terms) the terms of the applicable Award Documentation. 
​
(iii)
To the extent the successor company (or a subsidiary or a parent thereof) assumes or substitutes the outstanding Restricted Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards on substantially the same terms and conditions (with appropriate adjustments pursuant to Section 3(c) to preserve the value of the Awards), such Awards shall remain outstanding on substantially the same terms and conditions following a Change in Control, and shall vest and pay out as provided under the terms of applicable Award Documentation; provided, however, that, if within 24 months following the date of such Change in Control, the Participant's employment with the Company or the successor company (or a subsidiary or a parent thereof) is terminated without Cause, such Participant's assumed or substituted outstanding Restricted Stock Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards, as applicable, not previously vested or earned shall become fully vested as of such date. To the extent the successor company (or a subsidiary or a parent thereof) does not assume or substitute the outstanding Restricted Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards on substantially the same terms and conditions, then such Awards, to the extent not previously vested, shall become fully vested and unrestricted as of the date of such Change in Control, subject to and as provided under (including with respect to payment terms) the terms of applicable Award Documentation.

​

who were members of the Incumbent Board will constitute at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction; or 
(iv)

​
(c)
Change in Control Price.   For purposes of this Section 10, "Change in Control Price" means the actual price per share paid in connection with a Change in Control. 
​
SECTION 11.
Amendments and Termination.
​
The Board may amend, alter, discontinue or terminate the Plan, but no amendment, alteration, discontinuation or termination shall be made which would impair the rights of an optionee or Participant under an Award theretofore granted, without the optionee's or Participant's consent. 
The Committee may amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively; but no such amendment or other action by the Committee shall (i) impair the rights of any holder without the holder's consent or (ii) subject to Section 3(c), directly or indirectly, through cancellation and regrant or any other method, reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the exercise price per share of Stock subject to a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or cancel a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right in exchange for a cash payment or another Award, including a new Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right having a lower exercise price, without prior shareholder approval. 
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Award Documentation, the Plan and the Awards are not intended to provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code, and they shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with such intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary in the Plan or any Award, if any provision of the Plan or any Award would cause the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to be violated, or otherwise cause any Participant to recognize income under Section 409A of the Code, then such provision may be modified by the Committee or the Board in any reasonable manner that the Committee or the Board, as applicable, deems appropriate; provided that the Committee or the Board, as applicable, shall preserve the intent of such provision to the extent reasonably practicable without violating the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. With respect to Awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the provisions of the Plan and any Award Documentation shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall be operated accordingly. If any provision of the Plan or any term or condition of any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee considers a Participant to be a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such Participant's "separation from service" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), and any amount hereunder is "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, any distribution of such amount that otherwise would be made to such Participant with respect to an Award as a result of such "separation from service" shall not be made until the date that is six months after such "separation from service," except to the extent that earlier distribution would not result in such Participant's incurring interest or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. If an Award includes a "series of installment payments" (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations), a Participant's right to such series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment, and if an Award includes "dividend equivalents" (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-3(e) of the Treasury Regulations), a Participant's right to such dividend equivalents shall be treated separately from the right to other amounts under the Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan or any Award Documentation is not warranted or guaranteed, and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by a Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

Subject to the above provisions, the Board shall have broad authority to amend the Plan to take into account changes in applicable securities and tax laws and accounting rules, as well as other developments. 
SECTION 12.
Unfunded Status of Plan.
​
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant or optionee by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant or optionee any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. 
SECTION 13.
General Provisions.
​
(a)
Stock Subject to Awards.   The Committee may require each person purchasing shares of Stock pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that the optionee or Participant is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Stock is then listed, any applicable federal or state securities law, and any applicable corporate law. 
​
(b)
Other Plans.   Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation or equity plans or arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. 
​
(c)
Continued Employment or Service.   The adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any right to continued employment or service with the Company, as the case may be, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the employment or service of any of its employees or consultants at any time. 
​
(d)
Taxes and Withholding.   No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for income tax purposes with respect to any Award (including dividends or Dividend Equivalents on any non-vested Restricted Stock Award, Performance Award or Other Stock-Based Award), the Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding the payment of, any federal, FICA, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld or paid with respect to such amount. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant. Unless the Committee otherwise determines, at or before the time of payment, tax withholding or payment obligations up to the Participant's minimum required withholding rate shall be settled with Stock that is part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. If and to the extent determined by the Committee, a Participant may elect to satisfy any additional tax withholding or payment obligation up to the Participant's maximum marginal tax rate by delivery of unrestricted stock duly owned by the Participant (and for which the Participant has good title free and clear of any liens and encumbrances). 
​
(e)
Governing Law.   The Plan and all Awards and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 
​
(f)
Computation of Benefits.   Any payment under this Plan shall not be deemed compensation for purposes of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company and shall not affect any benefits under any other benefit plan now or subsequently in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits is related to the level of compensation.

​
(g)
Division Sale.   Unless the Committee otherwise determines at or after the time of grant, and except as otherwise provided herein, if any Participant's employment or service with the Company terminates solely due to a Division Sale, such Division Sale shall be treated as an involuntary termination of employment or service of such Participant hereunder and under the terms of any Award. 
​
(h)
Foreign Law.   The Committee may grant Awards to eligible individuals who are foreign nationals, who are located outside the United States, or who are otherwise subject to or cause the Company to be subject to legal or regulatory provisions of countries or jurisdictions outside the United States, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan and, in furtherance of such purposes, the Committee may make such modifications, amendments, procedures, subplans and the like as may be necessary or advisable to comply with such legal or regulatory provisions. 
​
(i)
Transferability of Awards.   Unless the Committee determines otherwise at or after grant, no Award may be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered prior to the date on which the Award is paid and any shares or amount of cash subject to such Award are distributed to the Participant, or, if later, the date on which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period lapses. Awards shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and, unless the Committee determines otherwise at or after grant, all Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee. Unless approved by shareholders, no Award shall be transferable by the Participant to a third-party for consideration. 
​
(j)
Recoupment, Cancellation or Clawback of Awards.   Any Awards granted under the Plan (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Awards) shall be subject to recovery by the Company in accordance with any clawback or recoupment arrangements or policies the Company has in place from time to time, including, without limitation, the terms of the Senior Executive Pay Recovery Policy of S&P Global and the S&P Ratings Services Pay Recovery Policy, or any successor policies thereto, as in effect from time to time. The Committee shall have full authority to implement any other policies and procedures necessary to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any rules promulgated thereunder and any other regulatory regimes. 
​
(k)
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.   The Committee may, in its sole discretion, condition eligibility to be designated a Participant in the Plan or to receive Awards and any of the benefits specified in the Plan or in the applicable Award Documentation on the Participant's execution of, compliance with, and/or certification of compliance with a non-competition and/or non-solicitation agreement in a form prescribed by the Committee or as set forth in any applicable Award Documentation. 
​
(l)
Miscellaneous.   
​
(i)
No employee, consultant, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Any Award granted under the Plan shall be a one-time Award that does not constitute a promise of future grants. The Company, in its sole discretion, maintains the right to make available future grants under the Plan. 
​
(ii)
If any provision of the Plan or any Award Documentation is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award Documentation, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award Documentation shall remain in full force and effect.

ARTICLE XIIAMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN
SECTION 12.01 Amendment.   The Board or the Committee may from time to time make such amendments to the Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interest of the Company without further approval of the Company's stockholders, except to the extent required by the Rules of the New York Stock Exchange (or rules of any other exchange or quotation system on which the Company's securities are then listed). 
SECTION 12.02 Company's Right to Terminate.   The Board or the Committee may terminate the Plan at any time and, in connection with any such termination, may deliver to each Participant the shares of Common Stock credited to his or her Deferred Stock Account, subject to and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) of the Code (or any successor provision thereto). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, neither the Board nor the Committee shall be authorized to exercise any discretion with respect to the selection of persons to receive credits of shares of Common Stock under the Plan or concerning the amount or timing of such credits under the Plan, and, subject to Section 12.03 of the Plan, no amendment or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect the interest of any Participant in shares previously credited to such Participant's Deferred Stock Account without that Participant's express written consent. 
SECTION 12.03 Section 409A.   With respect to deferrals subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan and any related election forms or agreements are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the provisions of the Plan and any related election forms or agreements shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall be operated accordingly. If any provision of the Plan or any term or condition of any related election forms or agreements would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee considers a Participant to be a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such Participant's "separation from service" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), and any amount hereunder is "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code, any distribution of such amount that otherwise would be made to such Participant with respect to a deferral as a result of such "separation from service" shall not be made until the date that is six months after such "separation from service," except to the extent that earlier distribution would not result in such Participant's incurring interest or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. If a deferral includes a "series of installment payments" (within the meaning of 
       2019 Proxy Statement       App B-8
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Appendix B (continued)
​
Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations), a Participant's right to such series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment, and if a deferral includes "dividend equivalents" (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-3(e) of the Treasury Regulations), a Participant's right to such dividend equivalents shall be treated separately from the right to other amounts under the deferral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan or any related election forms or agreements is not warranted or guaranteed, and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by a Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency. 
SECTION 13.03 Rights and Obligations.   Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any Director for reelection by the Company's shareholders or to limit the rights of the shareholders to remove any Director. No Director or other person shall have any claim to be entitled to make a deferral under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Directors or Beneficiaries under the Plan. The terms and conditions of deferrals under the Plan need not be the same with respect to each Director. 
SECTION 13.04 Binding Effect.   The Plan shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Participant or his or her Beneficiary, his or her heirs and legal representatives, and the Company.
