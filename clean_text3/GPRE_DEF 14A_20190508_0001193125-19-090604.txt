Common Stock, represented by the proxies received pursuant to this solicitation and not timely revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated in properly submitted proxies. If no instructions are indicated, such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board. If any other matters are properly presented to the Annual Meeting for action, the person(s) named in the enclosed form(s) of proxy and acting thereunder will have discretion to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. Broker non-votes and abstentions are not treated as votes cast for any of the matters to be voted on at the meeting.  A holder of Common Stock who has submitted a proxy may revoke it prior to its exercise by providing written notice of revocation or a later-dated proxy to the Corporate Secretary of the company at any time before the closing of the polls at the meeting, or by voting in person at the meeting. Any written notice revoking a proxy should be sent to: Green Plains Inc., Attention: Michelle S. Mapes, Corporate Secretary, 1811 Aksarben Drive, Omaha, Nebraska 68106. Attendance in person at the Annual Meeting does not itself revoke a proxy; however, any shareholder who attends the Annual Meeting may revoke a previously submitted proxy by voting in person. 
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, with respect to those shares, you are considered the shareholder of record, or a registered shareholder, and these materials were sent to you directly by us. If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and that organization should have forwarded these materials to you. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee holding your shares how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Please refer to the information forwarded by your broker or bank for instructions on how to direct their vote. However, since you are not a shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you bring with you a legal proxy from the shareholder of record. 
If you are a registered shareholder, there are four ways to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• going to the Internet website indicated on the Proxy Card or voting instruction card and following the instructions provided  (you will need the control number that is included in the Notice);  
• calling the toll-free telephone number indicated on the Proxy Card or voting instruction card (you will need the control  number that is included in the Notice);  
• signing, dating and returning the Proxy Card if you request to receive your proxy materials by mail; or   
• written ballot in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Your shares will be voted as you indicate. If you do not indicate your voting preferences, the appointed proxies will vote your shares "For" all nominees in Proposal 1, and "For" Proposals 2, 3 and 4. 
Broker Non-Votes 
Broker non-votes occur when nominees, such as brokers and banks holding shares on behalf of the beneficial owners, are prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions at least ten days before the Annual Meeting date. If no instructions are given within that time frame, the nominees may vote those shares on matters deemed "routine" by the New York Stock Exchange. On non-routine matters, nominees cannot vote without instructions from the beneficial owner, resulting in so-called "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy on any voting matter. All proposals are considered non-routine, except for Proposal 2. 
Expenses and Methods of Solicitation 
We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies. In addition to the use of the mail and Internet, proxies may be solicited personally, or by telephone or other means of communications, by directors, officers and employees of the company and its subsidiaries who will not receive additional compensation therefor. We will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and nominees for reasonable expenses incurred related to forwarding proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners of shares held by such banks, brokerage firms and nominees. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the holders of the Common Stock, assuming a quorum is present, is required to elect each director. The three persons receiving the greatest number of votes at the Annual Meeting shall be elected as directors. Since only affirmative votes count for this purpose, broker non-votes or votes withheld will not affect the outcome of the voting on Proposal 1. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the holders of the Common Stock, assuming a quorum is present, is required to approve Proposals 2, 3 and 4. Since only votes cast count for this purpose, broker non-votes and abstentions will not affect the outcome of the voting on Proposals 2, 3 and 4. 
BOARD HIGHLIGHTS 
Our current directors whose terms are expiring have been nominated by the Board for reelection at the Annual Meeting. For more information on all of the director nominees, see page 12 of this Proxy Statement. 
COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS 
Our company is a vertically integrated commodity processing company and one of the largest consolidated owners' of ethanol plants in North America. The company operates four business segments: (1) ethanol production, which includes the production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil, (2) agribusiness and energy services, which includes grain handling and storage and marketing and merchant trading for company-produced and third-party ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, natural gas and other commodities, (3) food and ingredients, which includes cattle feeding, and food-grade corn oil operations, and (4) partnership, which includes fuel storage and transportation services.  2018 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Fiscal 2018 presented a challenging operating environment, as our business continued to experience the impacts of a continued deflationary cycle within the agriculture and energy sectors. Both sectors continued to face pricing pressures from increased global supplies of grains, proteins, oilseeds and an oversupply of ethanol bolstered by escalating trade tensions around the world. 
Despite these challenging operating conditions, we continued to execute on our business strategies by managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams, as exemplified by the following: 
Key Operating Accomplishments 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Net income of $15.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    EBITDA of $224.7 million (see EBITDA reconciliation in the companys Form  10-K, filed February 20, 2019).  
[END TABLE]
Achievements 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The acquisition of cattle-feeding operations located in Sublette, Kansas and Tulia, Texas bringing the companys total  capacity to 355,000 head of cattle and making us the 4th largest feedlot operator in the U.S.;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Disposition of three ethanol plants and Fleischmanns Vinegar resulting in total net cash proceeds of approximately  $671.7 million and a pre-tax gain of $150.4 million;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Repayment of the remaining balance of our $500 million term loan due August, 2023; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Formation of Optimal Aquafeed, a 50/50 joint venture to produce high-quality aquaculture feeds utilizing proprietary  techniques and high-protein feed ingredients.  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
Compensation Philosophy.  Our Compensation Committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay that reflects corporate, business unit and individual performance that also aligns with the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our compensation philosophy we pay executive salaries that are lower than our competitors, with more compensation "at-risk" through long-term equity awards and annual cash incentive awards. Our annual cash incentive plan provides an incentive to achieve financial and operational performance aligned with our business plan and longer term strategy. 
The following chart illustrates the mix of total direct compensation elements for our NEOs at target performance, excluding our former Chief Operating Officer and the President of Fleischmann's Vinegar who both resigned during fiscal 2018. 
CEO Avg. Other NEOs 
Pay for Performance.  Our Compensation Committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay in alignment with corporate and individual performance, aligned with our strategy of growing ethanol and non-ethanol EBITDA, while operating safely and delivering an appropriate level of return to our shareholders. 
Performance against pre-established EBITDA goals is a key element of our annual incentive plan. As the chart on page 20 indicates, our CEO's total realizable compensation is well-aligned with our company and stock price performance. 
Our Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program effectively aligns executive pay with performance returns to shareholders and creates a growth-oriented, long-term value proposition for our shareholders. For more information, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Executive Overview – Pay for Performance" included in the Proxy Statement.  Response to Say On Pay Vote and Changes to our Executive Compensation Program.  At our 2017 annual meeting, our shareholders approved our NEOs' compensation, with approximately 76% of the votes cast in favor of our say on pay proposal. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee, with input from its independent compensation consultant, considered the 2017 vote results, shareholder input and current market practices and made significant changes to the compensation program for 2018 which have continued in 2019. Based on shareholder input and to better align our compensation programs with our strategy and market practice, we implemented the following changes for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We transitioned our long-term incentive program to a forward looking program, with awards contingent on future performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Beginning in 2018, one half of annual awards to executive officers under the LTIP will be in the form of performance share  units (PSUs) which vest based 50% on total shareholder return relative to a performance peer group and 50% based on return on net assets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We adjusted our Chief Executive Officer's salary and target annual incentive in 2018 to align more closely with market  norms, increasing salary, but maintaining a salary below market median and decreasing his target annual incentive to 200% of salary, to maintain his target cash compensation at the same level as in 2017;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We adopted a compensation recovery (clawback) policy to allow the Board to recoup incentive compensation in appropriate  circumstances;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We eliminated the excise tax gross up provision in our Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation advisor to provide advice in connection with our executive  compensation program and incentive plan design.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes these changes have strengthened alignment between executive compensation and the interests of our shareholders, and support the achievement of our strategic and financial goals. At our 2018 annual meeting, our shareholders approved our NEOs' compensation, with approximately 98% of the votes cast in favor of our say on pay proposal. 
For a more detailed discussion of these changes, please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 16 of this Proxy Statement. 
GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Our company has a history of strong corporate governance. By evolving our governance approach in light of best practices, our Board drives sustained shareholder value and best serves the interests of our shareholders.

 PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR AN ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD MAY 8, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of Green Plains Inc. in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors (the "Board") 
to be voted at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at 10:00 a.m., 
Central Standard Time, at the Scott Conference Center located at 6450 Pine Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68106, on Wednesday, May 8, 
2019, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). 
This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy is first being sent or made available to shareholders on or around March 28, 2019. This Proxy Statement provides information that should be helpful to you in deciding how to vote on the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
We are asking you to elect the three nominees identified in this Proxy Statement as directors of the Company until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, to ratify the election of our auditors, and to vote to approve both the 2019 
Equity Incentive Plan and our executive compensation.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Iowa, our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our amended and restated bylaws, our business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. 
Independent Directors 
Under the corporate governance listing standards of the NASDAQ and our committee charters, the Board must consist of a majority of independent directors. In making independence determinations, the Board observes NASDAQ and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") criteria and considers all relevant facts and circumstances. The Board, in coordination with its Nominating and Governance Committee, annually reviews all relevant business relationships any director nominee may have with our Company. As a result of its annual review, the Board has determined that each of its current non-employee directors meet the independence requirements of the NASDAQ and the SEC. 
Meetings of the Board 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Board held four regular meetings and four special meetings. Each of the serving directors attended at least 76% of all meetings held by the Board and committee meetings of the Board on which the applicable director served during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Board and committees met in executive session, without management at each meeting. 
The table below shows the meeting attendance for each director in 2018:

Communications with the Board 
Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board as a whole, or with individual directors, may direct any correspondence to the following address: c/o Corporate Secretary, Green Plains Inc., 1811 Aksarben Drive, Omaha, Nebraska 68106. All communications sent to this address will be shared with the Board, or the Board Chairman or any other specific director, if so addressed. 
It is a policy of the Board to encourage, but not require, directors to attend each annual meeting of shareholders. The Board's attendance allows for direct interaction between shareholders and members of the Board. All of our directors, with the exception of one, attended our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board and each of its committees are involved in overseeing risk associated with our company. In its oversight role, the Board annually reviews our company's strategic plan, which addresses, among other things, the risks and opportunities facing our company. While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, it has delegated certain risk management oversight responsibilities to the Board committees. 
One of the primary purposes of the Audit Committee, as set forth in its charter, is to act on behalf of the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee company processes for the management of business/financial risk and for compliance with applicable legal, ethical and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, as part of its responsibilities as set forth in its charter, the Audit Committee is charged with (i) inquiring of management and our company's outside auditors about significant risks and exposures and assessing the steps management has taken or needs to take to minimize such risks and (ii) overseeing our company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including the development and maintenance of an internal audit function to provide management and the Audit Committee with ongoing assessments of our company's risk management processes and internal controls. In connection with these risk oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee has regular meetings with our company's management, internal auditors and independent, external auditors.  The Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews our company's corporate governance guidelines and their implementation, as well as regularly evaluates new and continuing directors for election to the Board. The Compensation Committee considers risks related to the attraction and retention of talented senior management and other employees as well as risks relating to the design of compensation programs and arrangements.

Code of Ethics 
The Board has adopted a Code of Ethics to which all officers, directors and employees, who for purposes of the Code of Ethics are collectively referred to as employees, are required to adhere in addressing the legal and ethical issues encountered in conducting their work. The Code of Ethics requires that all employees avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all laws, rules and regulations, conduct business in an honest and fair manner, and otherwise act with integrity. Employees are required to report any violations of the Code of Ethics and may do so anonymously by contacting https://gpreinc.alertline.com. The Code of Ethics includes specific provisions applicable to the company's principal executive officer and senior financial officers. The full text of the code of ethics is published on our website in the "Investors – Corporate Governance" section. 
The Board also has adopted a Related Party Policy which addresses our company's procedures with respect to the review and approval of "related party transactions" that are required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. The Code of Ethics provides that any transaction or activity in which the company is involved with a "related party" (which is defined as an employee's child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of an employee of ours, or any entity that is either wholly or substantially owned or controlled by an employee of ours or any of the foregoing persons and any trust of which an employee of ours is a trustee or beneficiary) shall be subject to review and approval by our Audit Committee so that appropriate measures can be put into place to avoid either an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Stock Ownership Guidelines: Prohibition on Short-Term and Speculative Trading and Pledging

[END TABLE]
Furthermore, our directors and each officer who is subject to the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is prohibited from holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan, with one director being granted an exception for the pledge of shares. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No Compensation Committee member (i) was an officer or employee of GPI, (ii) was formerly an officer of GPI or (iii) had any relationship requiring disclosure under the SEC's rules governing disclosure of related person transactions. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we had no "interlocking" relationships in which (i) an executive officer of GPI served as a member of the Compensation Committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee of GPI, (ii) an executive officer of GPI served as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee of GPI, or (iii) an executive officer of GPI served as a member of the Compensation Committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of GPI.  PROPOSAL 1- ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Each year a different group of directors is elected on a rotating basis. James Crowley, Gene Edwards and Gordon Glade are up for reelection at the Annual Meeting (to serve until the 2022 annual meeting or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified). The terms of Jim Anderson, Wayne Hoovestol and Ejnar Knudsen expire at the 2020 annual meeting. The terms of Todd Becker, Thomas Manuel, Brian Peterson and Alain Treuer expire at the 2021 annual meeting. 
Age Director Tenure 
Director Nomination Process 
The Board is responsible for approving nominees for election as directors. To assist in this task, the Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending nominees to the Board. This committee is comprised solely of independent directors as defined by the rules of the NASDAQ and the SEC. 
The Board has a policy of considering director nominees recommended by our shareholders. A shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective board nominee for the Nominating and Governance Committee's consideration can write to the Nominating and Governance Committee, c/o Michelle S. Mapes, Corporate Secretary, Green Plains Inc., 1811 Aksarben Drive, Omaha, NE 68106. In addition to considering nominees recommended by shareholders, our Nominating and Governance Committee also considers prospective board nominees recommended by current directors, management and other sources. Our Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates all prospective board nominees in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation. 
As part of the nomination process, our Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board periodically the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the current make-up of the Board. This assessment includes issues of judgment, diversity, experience and skills. In evaluating prospective nominees, including nominees recommended by shareholders, our Nominating and Governance Committee looks for the following minimum qualifications, qualities and skills: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    outstanding achievement in the individuals personal career;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    ability to represent the total corporate interests of our company (a director will not be selected to, nor will he or she be  expected to, represent the interests of any particular group).  
[END TABLE]
As set forth above, our Nominating and Governance Committee considers diversity as one of a number of factors in identifying nominees for director. The Committee adopted a policy in 2017 specifically addressing gender diversity whereby it resolved to ensure that when a vacancy arises on the Board, it will ensure the candidate pool always contains at least one diverse candidate specifically with respect to gender. Based on shareholder comments, the Committee is continuing to evaluate additional ways to address gender diversity in particular. The Committee also views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint as well as traditional diversity concepts such as race, national origin and gender. 
Shareholders who wish to submit a proposal for inclusion of a nominee for director in our proxy materials must also comply with the deadlines and requirements of our bylaws and of Rule 14a-8 promulgated by the SEC. Please see "Additional Information" in   this Proxy Statement for more information regarding the procedures for submission by a shareholder of a director nominee or other proposals.

Executive Overview 
RESPONSE TO SAY ON PAY ADVISORY VOTE 
At our 2017 annual meeting, 76% of our shareholders approved our say on pay proposal. We were gratified by the passing vote, but recognized that the approval percentage was not at a level we deemed acceptable. As a result, management engaged with two proxy advisory firms and the feedback received was strongly supportive of the changes to our executive compensation program that had been made for 2017. The committee, with input from its independent compensation consultant, further considered the 2017 vote results and current market practices and introduced additional changes for 2018, as summarized in the proxy summary on page 2 of this proxy statement. 
At our 2018 annual meeting, our shareholders approved our NEOs' compensation, with approximately 98% of the votes cast in favor of our say on pay proposal. 
The committee and the Board value input from our shareholders and will carefully consider the results of the say on pay vote, and will continue to seek direct feedback from shareholders.  Fiscal 2018 Compensation Program Improvements 
In response to the results of previous say on pay votes and shareholder and proxy advisor feedback, our NEO compensation program was significantly amended to enhance alignment between executive compensation and the interests of our shareholders, as follows:

BEST PRACTICES AND GOOD GOVERNANCE

These changes follow several years of executive compensation program enhancements by the committee as summarized in the table above. 
COMPANY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Our Business 
Green Plains is an Iowa corporation, founded in June 2004 as an ethanol producer. We have grown through acquisitions of ethanol production facilities and adjacent commodity processing businesses. We are focused on generating stable operating margins through our diversified business segments and risk management strategy. We own and operate assets throughout the ethanol value chain: upstream, with grain handling and storage; through our ethanol production facilities; and downstream, with marketing and distribution services to mitigate commodity price volatility, which differentiates us from companies focused only on ethanol production. Our other businesses, including our partnership and cattle feeding operations leverage our supply chain, production platform and expertise. 
We formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to be our primary downstream storage and logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol we produce. The partnership completed its IPO on July 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, we own a 49.1% limited partner interest, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of the partnership's incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 48.9% limited partner interest. The partnership is consolidated in our financial statements. 
We group our business activities into the following four operating segments to manage performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ethanol Production.  Our ethanol production segment includes the production of ethanol, distillers grains  and corn oil at 13 ethanol plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas. At capacity, our facilities are capable of processing approximately 387 million bushels of corn per year and producing approximately  1.1 billion gallons of ethanol, 2.9 million tons of distillers grains and 292 million pounds of industrial grade corn oil, making us one of the largest ethanol producers in North America. On November 15, 2018, we completed the  sale of three ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa and Riga, Michigan and announced the permanent closure of our ethanol plant located in Hopewell, Virginia.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Agribusiness and Energy Services.  Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain procurement,  with approximately 47.2 million bushels of grain storage capacity, and our commodity marketing business, which markets, sells and distributes ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethanol for a  third-party producer as well as buy and sell ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, crude oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Food and Ingredients.  Our food and ingredients segment includes six cattle feeding operations with the  capacity to support approximately 355,000 head of cattle and grain storage capacity of approximately 11.7 million bushels and food-grade corn oil operations. Fleischmann's Vinegar, one of the world's largest producers of food-grade  industrial vinegar, was also included in the food and ingredients segment until its sale on November 27, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Partnership.  Our master limited partnership provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning,  operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. The partnership's assets include 32 ethanol storage facilities, seven fuel terminal facilities and  approximately 2,840 leased railcars.  
[END TABLE]
2018 Business Highlights 
Fiscal 2018 presented a challenging operating environment, as our business continued to experience the impacts of a continued deflationary cycle within the agriculture and energy sectors. Both sectors continued to face pricing pressures from increased global supplies of grains, proteins, oilseeds and an oversupply of ethanol obstructed by escalating trade tensions around the world. 
Despite these challenging operating conditions, we continued to execute on our business strategies by managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams, as exemplified by the following: 
2018 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Key Operating Accomplishments 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Net income of $15.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    EBITDA of $224.7 million (see EBITDA reconciliation in the companys Form  10-K, filed February 20, 2019).  
[END TABLE]
 Achievements 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The acquisition of cattle-feed operations located in Sublette, Kansas and Tulia, Texas bringing the companys total  capacity to 355,000 head of cattle and making us the 4th largest feedlot operator in the U.S.;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Disposition of three ethanol plants and Fleischmanns Vinegar resulting in total net cash proceeds of approximately  $671.7 million and a pre-tax gain of $150.4 million;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Repayment of the remaining balance of our $500 million term loan due August, 2023; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Formation of Optimal Aquafeed, a 50/50 joint venture to produce high-quality aquaculture feeds utilizing proprietary  techniques and high-protein feed ingredients.  
[END TABLE]
Pay for Performance 
The committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay in alignment with corporate, business unit and individual performance primarily based on the following three factors, which in turn are expected to align executive pay with returns to shareholders over time: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Expansion of our company, both organically and through acquisitions, as our scale creates the platform for future growth and  influences the stability of our companys earnings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The companys return on net assets (RONA); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The total shareholder return of our company as compared to our Performance Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
We have diversified our business significantly during the last few years and remain a growth-oriented company focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders. However, deflationary cycles within the global commodity markets can have a significant impact on the price of our Common Stock. As such, we believe that the current best indicator of our long-term performance is TSR versus our Performance Peer Group as well as performance of our RONA against our internal goals set by our Board. The other primary factor in aligning our pay and performance is whether we have remained a growth-oriented company as measured by EBITDA performance for both our ethanol and non-ethanol businesses. 
Performance against pre-established EBITDA goals was a key element of our 2018 annual incentive plan. In the last several years, we have used key acquisitions and a joint venture project to transform our platform and build future value through segment and product diversification. Consistent EBITDA growth will result in greater annual incentive plan payouts, while shortfalls in EBITDA will result in below target payouts. As the chart below indicates, our CEO's total bonus payout is well-aligned with our EBITDA performance.

 The following chart details our CEO's realizable compensation compared to his target compensation for each of the years ended 2016, 2017 and 2018. We believe this chart demonstrates that our CEO's compensation is, as intended, largely at risk and closely and appropriately linked to performance, including the performance of our stock price. 
CEO Realizable Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Target compensation is defined as (i) base salary, (ii) the target annual incentive opportunity for the year,  and (iii) the value as of grant date of RSAs and PSUs granted during each year.  
  (2)  Realizable compensation is defined as (i) base salary, (ii) the actual annual incentive earned for the year, and  (iii) the value as of December 31, 2018 of RSAs and PSUs (at target) granted during each year. The realizable value of RSAs and PSUs is based on our closing stock price on December 31, 2018 of $13.11 per share.  
[END TABLE]
The committee believes that our executive compensation program effectively aligns pay with performance based on the key factors discussed above, thereby aligning executive pay with returns to shareholders and creating a growth-oriented, long-term value proposition for our shareholders. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
The committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay in alignment with corporate, business unit and individual performance. A large portion of total direct compensation is "at-risk" through long-term equity awards and annual cash incentive awards. These awards are linked to actual performance and include a significant portion of equity. See charts on pages 4 and 26 for more information regarding the target annual compensation mix for our CEO and other NEOs. 
Ongoing Monitoring of Compensation Best Practices and Programs in a Dynamic Environment—Overview 
Our company has undergone diversification in the business over the last several years. As a result, and in response to our 2017 say on pay vote, the committees conducted an in-depth analysis of our compensation and governance practices, including an enhanced shareholder outreach process and a thorough review of all aspects of our compensation strategies and program. This analysis resulted in significant changes to our compensation programs for fiscal 2018 (discussed above under Fiscal 2018 Compensation Program Improvements at page 17). The committee engaged in an ongoing review of our compensation practices and governance policies in 2017 and 2018, and the solicitation of advice from the committee's compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian). 
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Actions at a Glance 
The following summarizes the key compensation decisions for the NEOs for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
☐  Base salary: In March 2018, the annual rate of Mr. Beckers salary  was increased and his 2018 target annual incentive was correspondingly decreased, to better align his compensation mix to market median and to maintain his target cash compensation at the same level as in 2017. The annual rate of base salary for  other NEOs was not adjusted for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
☐  Annual Incentive Bonus: For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded  annual bonuses, for the NEOs that were employed for the entire year, ranging from 64% to 104% of each NEOs target bonus. See the section entitled Annual Incentive Compensation for a complete discussion of our performance measures, targets and  performance for 2018 and annual bonuses awarded by the Committee for the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
☐  Long-Term Incentive Awards: As part of the significant changes made to our  executive compensation program for 2017 and beyond, we shifted from a backward-looking/trailing performance measurement to a forward-looking performance measurement for our LTIP. Accordingly, we discontinued our historical practice of issuing solely  service-based RSAs based on trailing performance, and instead, in early 2018, each of the NEOs was granted a combination of PSUs and RSAs. In addition, in order to foster retention of the NEOs and further align their interests with stockholders, the  Committee granted additional RSAs to the NEOs that vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date (Cliff Vesting RSA).  
[END TABLE]
 These compensation decisions are discussed in more detail in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and shown in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table that follows. 
The Incentive Plan 
The Incentive Plan advances our pay-for-performance philosophy by providing participants under the Incentive Plan with annual bonus incentive opportunities linked to the achievement of specific performance goals. The Incentive Plan is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforce the company's goal-setting and strategic planning process;  
• Recognize the efforts of its management in achievement objectives; and  
• Aid in attracting and retaining competent management, thus ensuring the long-range success of the company.   
[END TABLE]
In the first quarter of each year, the Compensation Committee sets objective performance measures for the company as a whole and establishes corresponding performance goals for each participant under the Incentive Plan, including our NEOs. In structuring the performance measures and goals, the Compensation Committee sets targets for achieving those goals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Minimum threshold before any annual performance bonus can be earned;  
• Target goal to incentivize a specific desired performance level; and  
• Maximum goal which sets an appropriate limit on the potential annual performance bonus that can be earned.   
[END TABLE]
After the end of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee determines whether the performance goals have been attained and approves any cash payment amount based upon the level of achievement of the annual performance goals. The Compensation Committee also evaluates each executive's performance for the year and determines their overall cash performance bonus based on an assessment of their performance, among other things, against the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leadership and company strategy;  
• Business performance and development;  
• Accomplishment of strategic objectives;  
• Commitment to development of management;  
• Growth initiatives; and  
• Financial and operational objectives.

Compensation Program Objectives and Philosophy 
The committee has designed our executive compensation program to serve several key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    attract and retain superior employees in key positions, with compensation opportunities that are competitive relative to the  compensation paid to executives at companies similar to us by generally setting target levels of annual total direct compensation opportunity for the NEOs within a competitive range of the median of our Pay Levels Peer Group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    align the interests of our NEOs with those of our shareholders by placing a significant portion of total direct compensation  at risk, and rewarding performance that exceeds that of our peer companies, through the use of equity-based LTIP awards and a share ownership and retention policy, with the ultimate objective of improving shareholder value over time.   
[END TABLE]
 In the chart below, we have summarized how the executive compensation program supports these executive compensation program objectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

ROLES OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS 
Compensation Committee 
The committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our executive compensation program. The Board appoints the members of the committee. Additionally, the Board has determined that each member of the committee meets the applicable requirements for independence established by applicable SEC rules and the listing standards of the NASDAQ. The committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    oversees our various compensation plans and programs and makes appropriate design decisions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    retains responsibility for monitoring our executive compensation plans and programs to ensure that they continue to adhere  to our companys compensation philosophy and objectives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    determines the appropriate compensation levels for all executives, including the NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
The committee meets on a regular basis and has an executive session without members of management present at each regular committee meeting. The committee's duties and responsibilities are described in its charter, which can be found on our website at http://investor.gpreinc.com/corporate-governance. The committee and the Board periodically review and, as appropriate, revise the charter. 
As provided by its charter and discussed in greater detail below, the committee engages an independent compensation consultant to advise it on the design of our executive compensation program. The committee engaged Meridian to advise it in connection with the 2017 executive compensation program and 2018 design. To determine the appropriate compensation levels, the committee considers, in conjunction with recommendations from its independent compensation consultant: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Total compensation paid to the NEOs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Our companys long-term and short-term incentive design and alignment with strategic and financial objectives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Our companys performance, the industry in which we operate, the current operating environment, our relative total  shareholder return performance and market compensation for similarly-situated executives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    How to balance short-term and long-term compensation to provide fair near-term compensation, to align executive pay with  long-term shareholder value, and to avoid structures that would encourage excessive risk taking.  
[END TABLE]
 The committee periodically reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that it remains competitive and provides the proper balance between cash and equity, and between short-term and long-term incentive compensation. The committee's regular analysis and refinement of the compensation program ensures continuing alignment of the elements of the compensation program with our company's business strategy and shareholder interests. During this process, the committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Evaluates the design of our compensation program to align pay and performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Evaluates the executive compensation policies to ensure a continued nexus between executive compensation and the creation of  shareholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Seeks to ensure that our companys compensation programs remain competitive, including comparing the total direct  compensation paid by our company with that of our Pay Levels Peer Group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Considers feedback received from our shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Consults as needed with its independent compensation consultant to review and refine the elements of our compensation  programs to ensure that our executive compensation meets our stated objectives and is consistent with the companys compensation philosophy; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Takes into consideration appropriate corporate acquisitions, if any, and the resulting impact on the size and complexity of  our companys business.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to its responsibilities for executive compensation plans and programs, the committee also evaluates and makes recommendations to the Board regarding our management and director compensation plans, policies and programs, and reviews benefit plans for management and other employees. 
Role of Chief Executive Officer 
The committee evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer who, in turn, on an annual basis, reviews the performance of his direct reports, which include each of the NEOs other than himself. The Chief Executive Officer presents his conclusions and recommendations with respect to performance and pay, including recommendations with respect to base salary adjustments and incentive award amounts, to the committee. The committee considers this information and then exercises its judgment in adopting or modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to be made to the NEOs. 
Use of an Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee's charter allows the committee to engage an independent compensation consultant to advise the committee on the design of our executive compensation. For 2018, the committee engaged Meridian, an independent executive compensation consulting firm, to provide advice to the committee on various factors relating to the development of our 2018 executive compensation program and design. 
Meridian is engaged directly by, and is fully accountable to, the committee and does not provide advice to management. The committee has determined that Meridian is independent based on the independence factors provided by the SEC and the NASDAQ. 
Use of Peer Companies in Setting Executive Compensation and Measuring Performance 
Purpose 
The committee uses peer groups for the following purposes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    To assess executive compensation opportunities (the Pay Levels Peer Group); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Beginning with the 2018 LTI awards, to assess the companys long-term performance, and in particular, to assess  relative total shareholder return for purposes of determining payouts for a portion of the PSU awards (the Performance Peer Group).  
[END TABLE]
As discussed in more detail below, our company has a unique product offering that makes it difficult to establish a group of peer companies for evaluating the competitiveness of our NEOs' compensation opportunities and for measuring our relative business performance. In particular, it is challenging to identify appropriate peers for our business performance among companies in our S&P 8-digit and 6-digit Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) codes, as many of the companies in those GICS codes that are of roughly similar size manufacture, market, and distribute food for human consumption. These companies typically use agricultural commodities as ingredients in their products, and as a result these companies would typically experience reduced performance when these commodity prices rise. In contrast, our products are not generally for human consumption and our product prices generally track the performance of an identified group of agricultural commodities. As those agricultural commodities prices rise, our financial performance will generally improve, and conversely, as those commodities prices fall, our financial performance will generally be negatively impacted. As a result, our company tends to operate in opposite economic cycles from many of the other food or agricultural-related companies in our general GICS codes. 
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with its former consultant Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC (Pearl Meyer), selected companies for the Pay Levels Peer Group that have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) similar in size and financial performance to us, (ii) within a relevant industry group (including companies engaged in the production of ethanol, alternative   fuels or gasoline oxygenates as well as the marketing and distribution of such fuels and companies engaged in the production of agriculture products), (iii) considered competitors to us according to analysts and advisory firms and other selection criteria. The composition of the peer group is periodically reviewed and, if appropriate, updated to ensure continued relevancy and to account for mergers, acquisitions, divestures or other business-related changes that may occur. The following companies comprised the Pay Levels Peer Group for 2018: 
The Andersons, Inc. / Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. / CVR Energy, Inc. / Darling Ingredients Inc. / Delek US Holdings, Inc. / Denbury Resources Inc. / H.B. Fuller Company / Koppers Holdings Inc. / Methanex Corporation / Renewable Energy Group, Inc. / SM Energy Company/ Whiting Petroleum Corporation 
The committee believes that it is appropriate to use companies that are generally similar in size to our company for pay comparisons. For performance comparisons, however, the committee believes it is appropriate to use a broader peer group that is not limited by size or location to set the standards for long-term incentive plan performance, as company size and location do not materially influence performance comparisons. Although the committee is referencing two different peer groups, there is a substantial overlap of companies in the two peer groups. 
The committee uses competitive pay information derived from the Pay Levels Peer Group to generally inform its compensation decisions, but does not formulaically benchmark based on this data. The committee generally sets target levels of annual total direct compensation for the NEOs within a competitive range of the market median at the Pay Levels Peer Group. The committee considers each executive's experience, responsibilities, performance and internal equity when setting compensation opportunities. Where company performance is strong, executives have the opportunity to earn above median compensation. Where company performance is weaker, compensation will be below the market median. 
Performance Peer Group 
To better reflect the company's operating segments of Feed, Food, and Fuel and the companies we compete with for employee talent and capital, in 2018, the Performance Peer Group was established for purposes of evaluating our performance under the company's incentive programs. In selecting the Performance Peer Group constituents, which are summarized in the table below, the Committee considered the following criteria: (i) industry, (ii) business operations similar to those of the company, focused on Feed, Food, and/or Fuel, (iii) the extent to which operations were global, (iv) company size, as measured by revenues and market capitalization, and (v) availability of publicly-disclosed financial information.

 Mix of Salary and Incentive Awards (at Target) 
The following charts illustrate the mix of total direct compensation elements for our NEOs at target performance, excluding our former Chief Operating Officer and the President of Fleischmann's Vinegar who both resigned during fiscal 2018. These charts demonstrate our executive compensation program's focus on variable, performance driven cash and equity-based compensation, a large portion of which is "at-risk" through long-term equity awards and annual cash incentive awards.

Components of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
BASE SALARY 
Our company provides NEOs with a base salary to compensate them for services rendered during each fiscal year. Base salary ranges for NEOs are determined for each executive based on the executive's position and responsibility by using market data supplied by the committee's independent compensation consultant. Base salary is designed to be competitive when compared with the Pay Levels Peer Group. The committee periodically reviews base salaries of senior executives, including the NEOs, to determine if adjustment is necessary based on competitive practices and economic conditions. Base salary for senior executives will also be reviewed and adjustment may be made based on individual performance and the individual's skills, experience and background. 
The chart below summarizes the annual base salary of our NEOs for fiscal 2018 and 2017.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
Overview 
To motivate performance, each of our NEOs was provided with an annual incentive award opportunity for fiscal 2018. The range of award payouts that an executive could earn, as well as the performance goals, were established in early 2018. 
We use incentive compensation in the form of annual bonuses to reinforce performance-based objectives and retain key personnel. The Compensation Committee established the Umbrella STIP, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 annual meeting. As required by and working within the parameters of the Umbrella STIP, the Compensation Committee set specific 2018 operational performance goals. The Umbrella STIP, effective January 1, 2014, limits individual annual incentive bonuses to no more than $10 million and eligible executives' incentive bonuses, as a pool, to no more than 6% of EBITDA, with each participating executive's share of the pool defined by the Umbrella STIP, 60% for the Chief Executive Officer and 10% for each other eligible executive, subject to reduction by the Compensation Committee. With 2018 EBITDA of $224,652,000, the maximum amount of the eligible pool was $22,465,200, of which the Chief Executive Officer would be eligible for a maximum of $13,479,120 and each other named executive officer would be eligible for a maximum of $2,246,520. The Umbrella STIP provides that certain specified employees may be awarded cash bonuses by the Compensation Committee upon meeting certain additional specified performance goals or other performance criteria as determined by the Compensation Committee.  Annual Incentive Award Opportunities 
In early 2018, the Compensation Committee established target annual incentive award opportunities for the NEOs for 2018, as summarized in the table below:

Annual Incentive Award Formula 
In early 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following performance measures weighting and goals for use in determining payouts under the 2018 annual incentive program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The plant safety goal is comprised of 11 different safety metrics inclusive of lost time, timeliness of incident  reporting, safety training, completion of safety drills, environmental plan review and training, environmental incident, third party audit close outs, process safety management (PSM) compliance, development of standard operating procedures (SOPs),  for maintenance, and for rail, SOP training, other on the job training requirements and compliance with the Food Safety Modernization Act. Safety is measured on a point basis with a base line score of 100 with deductions for not meeting safety  objectives.  
  (2)  Maximum potential payout for each measure (as a% of the weighting at target) is 200% of target.  
[END TABLE]
Each measure is separately weighted and a minimum level of total EBITDA of $100 million is required in order for executive officers to be eligible for a bonus payout under the 2018 annual incentive program. In addition, total Company EBITDA must exceed $160 million in order for NEOs to be eligible for an above target payout. If performance falls between the specified performance levels, the payout earned will be determined using a straight-line interpolation. 
The performance levels, aggregate performance required to earn a payout at each level and corresponding payouts for the NEOs are summarized in the table below:

 Determination of Payouts 
Following the end of 2018, the Compensation Committee assessed the company's performance on the two financial measures, cost savings, the execution of the Portfolio Optimization Plan and plant safety, and determined the initial payout. Since the company only exceeded the $100 million total Company EBITDA funding hurdle after the inclusion of the gains resulting from the execution of the Portfolio Optimization Plan, the Committee elected to generally cap payouts under the annual incentive program for 2018 at target.

[END TABLE]
Notably, in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, the annual bonus awarded (64.3% of his target bonus) is significantly below his target payout. The Committee also believes that the 2018 bonuses properly reflect the company's performance and each executive's contributions during the year and are consistent with our compensation philosophy and objectives. 
In addition, since the Committee exercised discretion to include the gains resulting from the execution of the Portfolio Optimization Plan in Total Company EBITDA for the purpose of determining whether the EBITDA funding hurdle was attained, and to foster retention of key executives including the NEOs, the 2018 bonus must be repaid in full, if the executive resigns from the Company prior to December 31, 2019. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
Overview 
Each of our NEOs was provided with long-term incentive award opportunities for fiscal 2018 that were tied to our performance. The principal objectives of the LTI awards are to (i) motivate our NEOs to drive sustained long-term shareholder value creation, (ii) grant award opportunities that are based on the competitive market, but then adjusted for our performance, and (iii) provide the NEOs with equity ownership opportunities that will further enhance their alignment with our shareholders' interests. The Committee believes that providing long-term equity-based awards incentivizes executives to balance short- and long-term decisions, which helps to mitigate excessive risk-taking by our executives. 
Grants are generally made in the first quarter of each year; however, in limited, special situations, equity awards may be granted at other times to attract new executives and to retain existing executives.  Fiscal 2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
After reviewing trends in executive compensation and pay-related governance policies and in response to the results of our 2017 say on pay vote, the Committee made the following changes to the company's LTI awards, beginning with the 2018 annual awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    As illustrated in the chart below, a shift was made from granting solely service-based RSAs based on an assessment of the  prior-years results to annual grants of (i) PSUs tied to three-year, forward-looking performance (based 50% on average annual RONA and 50% on total shareholder return relative to our Performance Peer Group) and (ii) service-based  RSAs that vest 33-1/3% on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd  anniversaries of grant, with one-half of opportunity granted in PSUs and RSAs, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    In addition, in 2018 the Committee awarded additional RSAs to the NEOs, in order to foster retention and further align their  interests with shareholders. The additional RSAs cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.

RONA was selected as a performance measure for PSU awards as strong RONA is very important to our sustained financial success and TSR was selected to further link executive officers' compensation to shareholder returns and drive shareholder value creation. 
The Compensation Committee views these modifications to be aligned with the objectives of motivating and rewarding executives for performance on key long-term measures, while also promoting retention of executive talent. 
Additional detail with respect to the design of PSUs is provided below. 
Performance Share Unit Awards. PSUs are tied to our company's long-term performance to ensure that our NEOs' compensation is directly linked to the achievement of sustained long-term operating performance and stock price performance. Reflective of the desire to balance prudent use of capital and returns to our shareholders, the committee has determined that awards will be earned based on a combination of our average annual RONA for a three-year performance period and our TSR relative to the Performance Peer Group (described on page 25 of the proxy) over the same period. PSUs are payable in shares of Common Stock on the vesting dates of the performance shares. Shares not earned in a given performance period expire and are forfeited. PSUs are also subject to potential forfeiture if an executive terminates their employment prior to vesting. The performance goals for the portion of the award tied to relative TSR is as follows:

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
The company provides limited perquisites to the NEOs. Consistent with the benefit offered to all other eligible employees, the company provides our NEOs with (i) a matching contribution to the company's 401(k) Plan, up to a maximum of $11,000 in 2018, as well as (ii) Company paid life insurance. In addition, in accordance with his employment agreement, Mr. Becker also receives additional insurance and disability benefits as well as a tax gross-up payment to cover the taxes associated with these benefits, the details of which are set forth below. 
EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS 
Our company has entered into Employment Agreements with Messrs. Becker, Neppl, Briggs, and Simril that provide for, among other things, potential payments and other benefits upon termination of employment for a variety of reasons.  See "Employment Agreements" and "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control" included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement for a description of these agreements, including the severance benefits thereunder. 
The Committee believes that these severance arrangements are an important part of overall compensation for our NEOs and an important recruitment and retention tool as most of our competitors have implemented similar arrangements for their senior employees. Certain of these agreements include Committee approved change of control provisions to provide reasonable personal protection to our senior executives in the context of an actual or potential change of control of our company. The committee views these arrangements as preventing management distraction during the critical periods prior to and immediately following a change of control. The Compensation Committee may adjust base salary, bonus percentage or long-term incentives to levels that exceed the initial terms of the executive officers' employment agreements based on its periodic review of compensation data. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION POLICY 
Our company has stock ownership guidelines to further align the interests of our non-employee directors and NEOs with those of our shareholders. The guidelines require our NEOs and non-employee directors to maintain an investment in our Common Stock at the following levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Chief Executive Officer, six times his annual base salary;  
● Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, four times their annual base salary;  
● All other NEOs, three times their base salary; and  
● Non-Employee Directors, five times their annual cash retainer.   
[END TABLE]
POLICY AGAINST HEDGING AND PLEDGING COMPANY STOCK 
In addition, the company has a policy that prohibits each NEO and director from (A) engaging in (i) short-term trading (generally defined as selling company securities within six months following the purchase), (ii) short sales, (iii) transactions involving derivatives, (iv) hedging transactions or (v) any other contractual derivative transactions, such as total return swaps and (B) holding company securities in a margin account or pledging company securities as collateral for a loan, unless granted an exception by the Board. One director has shares currently pledged and has been granted a Board exception. 
COMPENSATION RECOVERY (CLAWBACKS) 
In early 2018, we adopted a compensation recovery policy that goes beyond the policies currently required by law. Specifically, the policy requires each executive officer to reimburse the company for all or a portion of any annual or long-term incentive compensation paid to the executive officer based on achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement due to the executive's misconduct, to the extent determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may also determine to require the forfeiture of unvested awards, reduce future compensation or take other disciplinary actions (including termination of employment). The Committee believes that this compensation recovery policy enhances our governance practices by creating direct financial costs to NEOs whose misconduct leads to a material financial restatement. 
In addition, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, upon restatement of our company's financial statements, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer would be required to reimburse us for any (i) bonuses, (ii) other incentive or equity-based compensation, and/or (iii) profits from stock sales, received in the 12-month period following the filing of financial statements that were later required to be restated due to their misconduct. Our company will also implement the incentive compensation "clawback" provisions mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 in accordance with the requirements of that Act as the method of their implementation becomes finalized by the stock exchanges. 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million on compensation the company may deduct for federal income tax purposes in any one year with respect to any of certain covered officers employed by the company. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") in December 2017, compensation that was "performance-based" was excluded from this $1 million limitation and was deductible by the company. Under the TCJA, the performance-based exception has been repealed generally for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. A limited exception applies to certain compensation that qualifies as performance-based compensation under pre-TCJA IRC Section 162(m), provided it is paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 and which has not been modified in any material respect on or after that date. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on that review and those discussions, the Compensation Committee recommends to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated into the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Employment Agreements 
Mr. Becker. Effective October 16, 2008, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Becker to serve as our President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Becker was named President and Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2009. Mr. Becker's employment agreement was amended in December 2009 to provide for a tax gross-up payment in the event of any tax payments on fringe benefits. Mr. Becker's agreement was subsequently amended in March 2018 to remove the tax gross-up payment. The terms of the employment agreement provide that Mr. Becker will receive the following: (i) an annual base salary, currently at $700,000, (ii) an annual target bonus as a percentage of base salary based on performance objectives set by the Board's Compensation Committee, (iii) annual awards of long-term incentive benefits of a type and level that is competitive with long-term incentive plan benefits provided to chief executive officers of public companies of comparable size in similar industries, and (iv) a fully exercisable option to acquire 150,000 shares at an exercise price equal to $10 per share. Mr. Becker's employment is at-will and may be terminated at any time, by either party, for any reason whatsoever. If employment is terminated without cause or for good reason, Mr. Becker will receive one year of base salary plus the greater of his maximum annual cash bonus for that year or the average bonus paid for the prior two years, up to one year of continued health and dental coverage (which ceases   upon acceptance of a comparable position within such period) and certain relocation assistance if he relocates beyond 50 miles within six months of termination. In addition, all shares acquired upon exercise of options granted therein would then be released from certain lock-up restrictions, and all outstanding options and other equity awards would fully vest. See Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control for additional information. 
Mr. Neppl. Effective September 11, 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Neppl.

Mr. Simril's employment agreement provided that he is at-will and may be terminated at any time, by either party, for any reason whatsoever. If employment had been terminated without cause or for good reason, Mr. Simril would have received six month's base salary and all outstanding equity awards would have fully vested. In addition, Mr. Simril entered into a letter agreement prior to the disposition of Fleischmann's Vinegar to clarify that his outstanding equity awards would fully vest on a change in control of Fleischmann's Vinegar.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
Employment Agreement for Mr. Becker 
We have an employment agreement with Mr. Becker. See Employment Arrangements above for additional information. Upon termination without cause or for good reason, Mr. Becker is entitled to (a) one year of base salary plus the greater of his maximum annual cash bonus for that year or the average bonus paid for the prior two years, (b) up to one year of continued health and dental coverage (which ceases upon acceptance of a comparable position within such period) and (c) certain relocation assistance if he relocates beyond 50 miles within six months of termination. In addition, all shares acquired upon exercise of options granted therein would then be released from certain lock-up restrictions and all outstanding options and other equity awards would fully vest. 
For such purposes, cause is defined as one of the following: (a) a material breach by the executive of the terms of this agreement, not cured within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from the Board of such breach, (b) conviction of, or plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony; (c) willful misconduct or gross negligence in connection with the performance of executive's duties; or (d) willfully engaging in conduct that constitutes fraud, gross negligence or gross misconduct that results in material harm to us. For purposes of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the executive's part shall be considered willful unless done, or omitted to be done, by the executive in knowing bad faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in, or   not opposed to, our best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for cause unless and until the executive has received a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the executive and an opportunity for the executive, together with his counsel, to be heard by the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the executive is guilty of the conduct set forth above in (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this definition and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. 
For such purposes, good reason is defined as any of the following if the same occurs without the executive's express written consent: (a) a material diminution in executive's base salary as described in the employment agreement; (b) a material diminution in executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities; (c) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom the executive is required to report; (d) a material change in the geographic location at which the executive must perform the services (for this purpose, any relocation of more than 50 miles is deemed a material change); (e) any material reduction or other adverse change in the executive's benefits under any applicable and properly approved compensation plan or arrangement without the substitution of comparable benefits; or (f) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by us under the employment agreement. To terminate for good reason, the executive must incur a termination of employment on or before the second anniversary of the initial existence of the condition. 
Employment Agreement for Mr. Neppl 
On September 11, 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Neppl. See Employment Arrangements above for additional information. Upon termination without cause or for good reason, he will receive an amount equal to six months base salary plus the greater of one-half of the maximum bonus for that year or one-half of the average bonus paid in the prior two years and all outstanding equity awards will fully vest. The definitions for cause and good reason are the same as described above for Mr. Becker. 
Employment Agreement for Mr. Briggs 
On March 4, 2011, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Briggs. See Employment Arrangements above for additional information. Upon termination without cause or for good reason, he will receive an amount equal to six months base salary and all outstanding equity awards will fully vest. The definitions for cause and good reason are the same as described above for Mr. Becker, except that the definition of good reason for Mr. Briggs does not specify the distance for an applicable relocation. Mr. Briggs resigned from the Company on December 31, 2018. 
Employment Agreement for Mr. Simril 
On September 30, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Simril and on October 22, 2018 entered into a letter agreement to clarify that his outstanding equity awards would fully vest on a change on a change in control of Fleischmann's Vinegar. See Employment Arrangements above for additional information. On the closing of the disposition of Fleischmann's Vinegar all of his equity awards immediately vested. 
Equity Acceleration 
2007 Equity Incentive Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan will fully vest upon a change in control unless (a) assumed by the successor corporation; (b) replaced with a cash retention program providing the same value or (c) otherwise limited by the plan administrator. A change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if in a single transaction or series of related transactions: 
(a) any person (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), or persons acting as a group, other than a trustee or fiduciary holding securities under an employment benefit program, is or becomes a beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly of securities representing 51% or more of our combined voting power; 
(b) there is a merger, consolidation, or other business combination transaction with or into another corporation, entity or person, other than a transaction in which the holders of at least a majority of our shares of voting capital stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to hold (either by such shares remaining outstanding or by their being converted into shares of voting capital stock of the surviving entity) a majority of the total voting power represented by the shares of voting capital stock of the company (or surviving entity) outstanding immediately after such transaction; or 
(c) all or substantially all of our assets are sold. 
2009 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended. Awards outstanding under the Plan will fully vest upon a change in control (a) if not fully converted and assumed, (b) if the awards are converted and assumed, after a qualifying termination, or (c) by the participant for good reason, if it is defined in the applicable award agreement or employment agreement. Qualifying termination is defined as a termination of employment within twenty-four months following a change in control or by us other than for cause, gross negligence, or deliberate misconduct which demonstrably harms us. A change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if in a single transaction or series of related transactions: 
(a) any person (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), or persons acting as a group, other than a trustee or fiduciary holding securities under an employment benefit program, is or becomes a beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly of securities representing 51% or more of our combined voting power;  (b) there is a merger, consolidation, or other business combination transaction with or into another corporation, entity or person, other than a transaction in which the holders of at least a majority of the shares of voting capital stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction continue to hold (either by such shares remaining outstanding or by their being converted into shares of voting capital stock of the surviving entity) a majority of the total voting power represented by the shares of voting capital stock of the company (or surviving entity) outstanding immediately after such transaction; 
(c) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who, at the beginning of such period, constitute the Board together with any new director(s) (other than a director designated by a person who entered into an agreement with us to effect a transaction described in (a) or (b) above) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by our shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors still in office, who either were directors at the beginning of the two-year period or whose election or nomination for election was previously approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or 
(d) all or substantially all of our assets are sold. 
The following tables provide information on potential benefits that could be received by the NEOs upon a termination or change in control. The tables assume termination as of the close of business on December 31, 2018. The closing price of our Common Stock on the last trading day of 2018 was $13.11. Post-termination health care represents the approximate value of such benefits. Upon a change in control, the executive may be subject to certain excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on any excess parachute payments under Section 280G. Currently, amounts shown as compensation related to change in control do not trigger excise taxes for excess parachute payments; and therefore are not included in the tables below.

On December 31, 2018, Mr. Briggs received a termination payment of $350,000 representing one year of base salary and a payment of $950,000 in exchange for the cash settlement of his PSUs (at target) and RSAs. 
On November 27, 2018, consistent with his letter agreement with the company, Mr. Simril's PSUs (at target) and RSAs vested in connection with the change in control of Fleishmann's Vinegar. The value of those awards on the termination date was $481,010, based on the closing price of our Common Stock $15.83 on that date. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
With the help of its compensation consultant, in 2017 the Compensation Committee reviewed our executive compensation policies and practices, and determined that our executive compensation programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The Compensation Committee also reviewed our compensation programs for certain design features which have been identified by experts as having the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, with none being identified in our programs. 
Moreover, the Compensation Committee determined that, for all employees, our non-executive compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk and instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation, as these programs are fully discretionary after performance for the relevant period has been achieved, recommended by senior management to the Compensation Committee and reviewed at such time to support our goals and objectives. 
Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of Mr. Todd Becker, our Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO"). 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of our median employee, other than our CEO, was $69,219; and  
• The annual total compensation of our CEO was $4,584,466.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of annual total compensation of Mr. Becker, our CEO, to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 66 to 1. 
To identify the median employee, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, the last day of our payroll, our total employee population consisted of  approximately 1,060 individuals with all of these individuals located in the United States. This population consisted of our full-time, part-time and temporary employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  To identify the median employee from our employee population, we calculated the amount of salary, and wages of our  employees as reflected in our payroll records and reported to the Internal Revenue Service as taxable wages. We annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. We also excluded employees from the  2018 acquisitions of the cattle feedlots in Sublette, Kansas and Tulia, Texas.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees  included in the calculation. Since all our employees are located in the United States, as is our CEO, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the  "median employee."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in  accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in total compensation of $69,219. The difference between such employee's salary, wages and overtime pay and the  employee's annual total compensation represents the estimated value of such employee's health care benefits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of  our 2018 Summary Compensation Table include in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference under Item 11 of Part III of our Annual Report. To maintain consistency between the annual total compensation of our CEO and the median employee, we  added the estimated value of our CEO's health care benefits, estimated at $12,110 to the amount reported in the Summary Compensation Table. This resulted in annual total compensation for purposes of determining the ratio in the amount of  $4,584,466, which exceeds the amount reported for him in the Summary Compensation Table by $12,110.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation of Directors 
Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we compensate our non-employee directors through a retainer structure for knowledge of us and the industry in which we operate, serving in a stewardship role, preparing for and attending Board and committee meetings, and serving as a committee Chairman. During 2018, each non-employee director was paid a cash retainer of $75,000 for serving on the Board, including serving on Board committees. In addition, the Chairman of the Board received a $20,000 retainer, the Audit Committee Chairman received a $20,000 retainer, the Compensation Committee Chairman received a $10,000 retainer and the Nominating and Governance Committee Chairman received a $4,000 retainer. Additionally, annual individual restricted stock grants were awarded equal to $125,000 in value, as measured on the date of grant. Board members are also reimbursed for travel and other business-related expenses. The Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for its directors at five times their annual cash retainer, or $375,000. 
The Compensation Committee retained Pearl Meyer, an independent consultant, during 2016 to evaluate our non-employee director compensation program and provide recommendations for appropriate changes, if any, to achieve market-competitiveness and consistency with recognized corporate governance best practices. With an objective that total compensation for all non-employee directors would be awarded within a range of the 50th to 75th percentile of industry compensation defined by our peer group analysis and other methodologies consistent with industry practice, in 2016, the Board approved an increase in the annual individual restricted stock grants from $100,000 to $125,000. 
On May 11, 2018, the company's non-employee directors each received a grant of 6,476 shares of restricted stock with an award value of $125,000 pursuant to the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Equity Plan"). The award vests and shares of Common Stock are issued after one year. 
As an employee, Mr. Becker does not receive director compensation. See Summary Compensation Table for information on his compensation. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the fees earned or paid in cash and stock awards granted to each outside director during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

 PROPOSAL 2 – RATIFICATION OF COMPANY'S AUDITORS 
Introduction 
The board has assessed the performance and independence of KPMG LLP (KPMG) and recommends that KPMG be re-appointed as the Company's auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. KPMG has served continuously as our auditor since 2009. In determining whether to recommend the re-appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered various factors, including: KPMG's performance on prior audits, and the quality and efficiency of the services provided by KPMG; an assessment of the firm's professional qualifications, resources and expertise; KPMG's knowledge of the Company's business and industry; the quality of the Audit Committee's ongoing communications with KPMG and of the firm's relationship with the Audit Committee and Company management; KPMG's independence; the length of time the firm has served in this role; the impact on the Company of changing auditors; and data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG and peer firms. Considered together, these factors enable the Audit Committee to evaluate whether the selection of KPMG as the Company's independent auditor, and the retention of KPMG to perform other services, will contribute to and enhance audit quality. Based on its evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of our shareholders. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has recommended, subject to ratification by the stockholders, that KPMG serve as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Representatives from KPMG are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. Such representatives are also expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Required Vote 
The ratification of the selection of KPMG as the Company's independent auditors for the 2019 fiscal year must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by shares of Common Stock present or represented at the Annual Meeting. Unless otherwise directed by the shareholders, proxies received in response to this solicitation by the Board will be voted for approval of the selection of KPMG to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the 2019 fiscal year. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the ratification of KPMG as our independent auditor for the 2019 fiscal year as set forth in Proposal 2. 
Independence of Auditors 
We have adopted policies and procedures for pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services to be provided by our independent auditor. It is our policy that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit, tax and other non-audit services. A proposal for audit or non-audit services must include a description and purpose of the services, estimated fees and other terms of the services. To the extent a proposal relates to non-audit services, a determination that such services qualify as permitted non-audit services and an explanation as to why the provision of such services would not impair the independence of the independent auditor are also required. 
All of the services provided by KPMG during 2018 and 2017 were approved in advance by our Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the services performed by our principal accountant is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence. 
Auditors' Fees 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, KPMG LLP was our independent auditor. The following table sets forth aggregate fees billed to us, including fees related to services rendered for GPP, for professional services rendered by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Plan Overview 
On February 6, 2019, the Board adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). 
General Information 
The purpose of the Plan is to replace the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan which terminates in May 2019. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that currently may be issued under all stock-based awards made under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan is 4,110,000. 
Equity awards are currently granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants pursuant to the Plan. As of March 2, 2019, approximately 1,150,123 shares remained available for awards under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan which if Proposal 3 is approved by shareholders, such shares will roll into the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. 
The Board believes that equity incentive compensation is essential in attracting, retaining and motivating individuals. The flexibility of the Plan in types and specific terms of awards allows future awards to be based on then-current objectives for aligning compensation with shareholder value. Shareholder approval will permit the Company to award equity incentives that help achieve these goals. 
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan. A copy of the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan is included as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement and may also be obtained from us free of charge upon written request. 
Summary of the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan 
Administration 
The Compensation Committee, which is comprised of four Independent Directors, administers the Plan and has full power and authority to determine when and to whom awards are granted, consistent with the provisions of the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Compensation Committee may amend or waive the terms and conditions, or accelerate the exercisability, of an outstanding award. The Compensation Committee has authority to interpret the Plan, and establish rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan. 
Eligible Participants 
Any employee, director or consultant of the Company or its subsidiaries, who is selected by the Compensation Committee, is eligible to receive an award under the Plan. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,060 employees and nine non-employee directors eligible to participate. 
Shares and Amounts Available For Awards 
The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under all stock-based awards made under the Plan is 4,110,000. Shares related to awards that are forfeited, terminated, or are withheld from issuance to pay a participant's tax withholding liability are added back and are available again under the Plan. Subject to adjustment for certain corporate transactions, no participant may be granted stock options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs") in any year with respect to more than 500,000 shares, and no participant may be granted restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other stock-based awards in any year with respect to more than 500,000 shares. The maximum dollar value that may be earned by any participant in any 12-month period with respect to performance units that are intended to comply with the performance based exception under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("the Code") and are denominated in cash is $5,000,000. 
Terms of Awards 
General.  Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other award granted under the Plan or any other compensation plan. Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or for cash or other consideration as determined by the Compensation Committee or as required by applicable law. Awards may provide that upon the grant or exercise thereof, the holder will receive cash, or shares of Common Stock, or any combination of these in a single payment. The exercise price per share under any stock option and the grant price of any SAR may not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant of such option or SAR. The fair market value of a share under the Plan is the closing price on any securities exchange or NASDAQ or other over-the-counter market on which the shares are listed on the date of determination. If the shares are not listed, the Compensation Committee will determine the fair market value of the shares. The term of awards will not be longer than 10 years. Generally, awards must require a minimum period of service of at least one year after the grant date before they vest. However, awards for up to 5% of the shares that may be issued under the Plan may provide for vesting prior to one year after the grant date.  Awards other than options and SARs may be granted subject to the achievement of performance goals. The performance goals may be established by the Compensation Committee from time to time. The performance goals may be one or more of the following business criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue;  
• Operating income (before or after taxes);  
• Pre- or after-tax income (before or after  allocation of corporate overhead and bonus);  
• Net income (before or after taxes);

[END TABLE]
The measure of performance may be set by reference to an absolute standard or a comparison to specified companies or groups of companies, and may be established separately for the Company as a whole or for our various groups, divisions or subsidiaries. 
Stock Options.  The holder of an option is entitled to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock at a specified exercise price during a specified time period, all as determined by the Compensation Committee. The option exercise price may be payable either in cash or in previously-acquired shares of Common Stock, or at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, by any other lawful means. Options are either "incentive stock options ("ISOs")" within the meaning of Section 421 of the Code or "nonqualified stock options" and will vest and become exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule established by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price is established by the Committee and cannot be less than the fair market value of a share on the date of grant; the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to an employee who owns 10% or more of the combined voting power of our stock will not be less than 110% of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant. The aggregate fair market value of Common Stock for which ISOs are granted and which are first exercisable in any one calendar year by any one employee may not exceed $100,000 in fair market value, which is determined as of the date of the grant. 
Stock Appreciation Rights.  The holder of a SAR is entitled to receive the excess of the fair market value, calculated as of the exercise date, of a specified number of shares of Common Stock over the grant price of the SAR. Such amount shall be paid in shares of Common Stock or in cash, as specified in the award agreement. SARs shall vest and become exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule established by the Compensation Committee. 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.  The holder of restricted stock will own shares of Common Stock subject to restrictions imposed by the Compensation Committee for a specified time period determined by the Compensation Committee. The holder of restricted stock is entitled to vote the shares and to receive any dividends declared on the shares; however, any dividends declared in shares are subject to the same restrictions as the underlying shares. The holder of restricted stock units will have the right, subject to any restrictions imposed by the Compensation Committee, to receive shares of Common Stock, at some future date determined by the Compensation Committee. The holder of restricted stock units will not have voting rights but will receive dividends paid with respect to the underlying shares. If the participant's employment terminates during the vesting period for any other reason, the Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited, unless the Compensation Committee determines that it would be in the Company's best interest to waive any remaining time-based restrictions. 
Performance Awards.  Performance awards give participants the right to receive payments in cash, or shares based solely upon the achievement of certain performance goals during a specified performance period. Any shares granted may be subject to any restrictions as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Stock-Based Awards.  The Compensation Committee may grant other equity-based awards, including unrestricted shares of our Common Stock, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee and limitations imposed by the Plan. The awards may be conditioned on meeting performance goals.  Duration, Termination and Amendment.  Unless discontinued or terminated by the Board, the Plan will expire on the ten year anniversary of the Plan, estimated as May 8, 2029. No awards may be made after that date. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in an applicable award agreement, any award granted under the Plan prior to expiration may extend beyond the end of such period through the award's normal expiration date. 
The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan at any time, although shareholder approval must be obtained if required to maintain compliance with the Code, by any applicable law or for any action that would, absent such approval, violate the rules and regulations of any securities exchange applicable to the Company. 
Repricing Awards 
The Compensation Committee may cancel outstanding options and SARs and replace them with either new options or SARs covering the same or a different number of shares but with an exercise price not less than fair market value on the new grant date, but only with shareholder approval. The Compensation Committee also may reduce the exercise price of options or SARs to a price not less than the then current fair market value of Common Stock on the date of adjustment, but only with shareholder approval. 
Change in Control 
Upon change in control, as defined in the Plan, all outstanding options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units that are not converted into similar awards with respect to the survivor or successor parent corporation shall become fully vested and, in the case of options and SARs, fully exercisable. Options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units that are converted into similar awards with respect to the survivor or successor parent corporation upon a change in control shall vest and, in the case of options and SARs, become fully exercisable upon a qualifying termination, as defined in the Plan. 
Unless provided otherwise in an award agreement or employment agreement, performance shares will be converted into restricted stock upon a change in control. If the restricted stock is not converted into stock or units of the survivor or successor parent corporation, the restricted stock will vest upon a change in control, and if the restricted stock is converted into stock or units of the survivor or successor parent corporation, it will vest upon a qualifying termination. 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement or employment agreement, performance units shall be converted into time-vesting restricted cash upon a change in control, and will vest upon a qualifying termination or in accordance with the vesting schedule under the original award if earlier. 
Transferability of Awards 
Unless otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, awards under the Plan may only be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Compensation Committee may permit a participant to transfer all or a portion of his awards to members of his immediate family, to trusts for the benefit of immediate family members, or to family limited partnerships in which the participant and his family members are the only partners. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences 
Grant of Stock Options and SARs.  The grant of a stock option or SAR is not expected to result in any taxable income for the recipient. 
Exercise of Options and SARs.  Upon exercising a non-qualified stock option, the optionee must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock acquired on the date of exercise over the exercise price, and the Company will generally be entitled at that time to an income tax deduction for the same amount. The holder of an incentive stock option generally will have no taxable income upon exercising the option (except that an alternative minimum tax liability may arise), and the Company will not be entitled to an income tax deduction. Upon exercising a SAR, the amount of any cash received and the fair market value on the exercise date of any shares of Common Stock received are taxable to the recipient as ordinary income and generally deductible by the Company, subject to applicable limits of the Code. 
Disposition of Shares Acquired Upon Exercise of Options and SARs.  The tax consequence upon a disposition of shares acquired through the exercise of an option or SAR will depend on how long the shares have been held and whether the shares were acquired by exercising an incentive stock option, a non-qualified stock option or SAR. Generally, there will be no tax consequence to the Company in connection with the disposition of shares acquired under a non-qualified option or SAR. If shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an ISO are not disposed of by the employee within two years from the date of grant of the option or within one year after the transfer of shares to him, the entire gain, if any, realized upon disposition will be taxable to the employee as long-term capital gain or loss and the Company will not be entitled to any federal income tax deduction. If an employee sells or exchanges the shares acquired under an ISO before the expiration of the required holding period, the employee will realize ordinary income in the year of such disposition in an amount equal to the difference between the option price and the lesser of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise (minus the exercise price) or the selling price (minus the exercise price). In such event, the Company will be entitled to a tax deduction in the year of disposition equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the employee, subject to the limits of the Code if applicable. 
Awards Other than Options and SARs.  As to other awards granted under the Plan that are payable either in cash or shares of Common Stock that are either transferable or not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, the holder of the award must recognize ordinary income in the year of receipt equal to (a) the amount of cash received or, as applicable, (b) the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares received (determined as of the date of receipt) over (ii) the amount (if any) paid for the shares by the holder of the award. The Company will generally be entitled at that time to an income tax deduction for the same amount.  As to an award that is payable in shares of Common Stock that are restricted from transfer and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, unless a special election is made by the holder of the award under the Code, the holder must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares received (determined as of the first time the shares become transferable or not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier) over (ii) the amount (if any) paid for the shares by the holder of the award. The Company will generally be entitled at that time to an income tax deduction for the same amount. 
Application of Section 16.  Special rules may apply to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In particular, unless a special election is made pursuant to the Code, shares received through the exercise of a stock option or SAR may be treated as restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a period of up to six months after the date of exercise. Accordingly, the amount of any ordinary income recognized and the amount of our income tax deduction will be determined as of the end of that period. 
Delivery of Shares for Tax Obligation.  Under the Plan, the Compensation Committee may permit participants receiving or exercising awards, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and upon such terms and conditions as it may impose, to deliver shares of Common Stock (either shares received upon the receipt or exercise of the award or shares previously owned by the holder of the option) to the Company to satisfy federal and state income tax obligations. 
New Plan Benefits.  The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, will determine the number and types of other awards that will be granted. Thus, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by eligible participants if the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan were to be approved by the shareholders. The closing price of a share of our Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ on March 14, 2019, was $16.25. 
Required Vote 
Upon the recommendation of management, the Board adopted the Green Plains Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and recommends to the shareholders that they vote FOR the approval of the Plan. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote (excluding broker non-votes) is required to approve the Plan. It is intended that, unless otherwise instructed, the shares represented by the Proxy (other than broker non-votes) will be voted "For" the approval of the Plan. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the Green Plains Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan set forth in Proposal 3.  PROPOSAL 4 – ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Introduction 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and related tables and disclosure, commonly known as a "say on pay" proposal. At our 2017 annual meeting, our stockholders supported an annual frequency for this advisory vote. As such, the Board has determined that our company will hold this advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers each year. 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation program is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals and to align executives' interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance above established goals with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value. Stockholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, beginning on page 16 for a more detailed discussion of our executive compensation program, including information about fiscal year 2018 compensation of our NEOs. 
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This say on pay proposal gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" adoption of the following resolution at the Annual Meeting. 
Required Vote 
Approval of the above resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the company present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (assuming a quorum is present). Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, and therefore such broker "non-votes" will have no effect on the outcome. 
The say on pay vote is advisory and therefore not binding on our company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions of our stockholders and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote and take into consideration any concerns raised by stockholders when determining future compensation arrangements. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" our executive compensation plan set forth in Proposal 4.  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS, PROMOTERS AND CERTAIN CONTROL PERSONS 
Our Related Party Policy addresses our company's procedures with respect to the review and approval of "related party transactions" that are required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. The Related Party Policy provides that any transaction or activity, in which GPI is involved, with a "related party" (which is defined as an employee's child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of an employee of ours, or any entity that is either wholly or substantially owned or controlled by an employee of ours or any of the foregoing persons and any trust of which an employee of ours is a trustee or beneficiary) shall be subject to review by our general counsel so that appropriate measures can be put into place to avoid either an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Any waivers of this conflict of interest policy must be in writing and be pre-approved by our general counsel. 
In determining whether a related party transaction will be approved or ratified, the Audit Committee may consider factors such as (a) the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction; (b) the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; (c) whether the terms are competitive with terms generally available in similar transactions with persons that are not related parties; (d) the benefit to us; and (e) the aggregate value of the transaction. 
Related Party Transactions 
Commercial Contracts 
Three subsidiaries of the company previously executed separate financing agreements for equipment with Amur Equipment Finance. Gordon Glade, a member of the company's Board of Directors, was formerly a shareholder of Amur Equipment Finance. As of the third quarter of 2018, Amur Equipment Finance is no longer considered a related party. In March 2014, a subsidiary of the company entered into $1.4 million of new equipment financing agreements with Amur Equipment Finance. Balances of $0.7 million related to these financing arrangements were included in debt at December 31, 2017. Payments, including principal and interest, totaled $0.2 million for each of the year ended December 31, 2018, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 2017 and 2016. 
Aircraft Leases 
Effective January 1, 2015, the company entered into two agreements with an entity controlled by Wayne Hoovestol for the lease of two aircrafts. Mr. Hoovestol is Chairman of the company's Board of Directors. The company agreed to pay $9,766 per month for the combined use of up to 125 hours per year of the aircrafts. Flight time in excess of 125 hours per year will incur additional hourly charges. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, payments related to these leases totaled $159 thousand, $182 thousand and $190 thousand, respectively. The company had no outstanding payables related to these agreements at December 31, 2018, and $2 thousand in outstanding payables related to these agreements at December 31, 2017. 
During 2018, the Company conducted a study of the costs associated with the aircraft leases and compared them to third party providers and determined that the costs were at or below what other similar service providers charged. This study was reviewed by the Audit Committee who agreed with the Company's conclusion. 
Other Transactions 
Pursuant to an operational services and secondment agreement, we are reimbursed by GPP for certain compensation of our employees, including executive officers, who serve in management, maintenance and operational functions in support of its operations. GPP also has various fee-based commercial agreements with our subsidiary, Green Plains Trade Group LLC, including a storage and throughput agreement, a rail transportation services agreement, a trucking transportation agreement and various terminal services agreements for our fuel terminal facilities. See the Related Party Transaction footnote in our 10-K for a full description of all the related party transactions. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and any persons who own more than ten percent of our Common Stock to file with the SEC various reports as to ownership of the Common Stock. These persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of the reports furnished to us, the aforesaid Section 16(a) filing requirements were met on a timely basis during fiscal 2018, except for a late filing for Michael Metzler on March 27, 2018 pertaining to the disposal of shares on March 15, 2018, a late filing for Anthony Vojslavek on May 15, 2018 pertaining to the disposal of shares on March 2, 2018, a late filing for Walter Cronin on November 21, 2018 pertaining to the disposal of shares on November 12, 2018 and a late filing for Alain Treuer on December 28, 2018 pertaining to the disposal of shares on December 24, 2018.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The company has an Audit Committee established in accordance with section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board of Directors has designated Mr. James Crowley as its Audit Committee financial expert as defined in Rule 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. Mr. Crowley also serves as the Audit Committee Chairman. 
Management is responsible for the company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of the company's internal control over financial reporting and an independent audit of the company's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue reports thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which has primary responsibility for the financial statements. KPMG, the company's independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2018, is responsible for expressing an opinion as to whether the company's audited consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee met with KPMG and Company management to discuss the company's financial reports. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standard No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees), as may be modified or supplemented. Additionally, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required to be delivered to them under the applicable requirements of the Public Company Oversight Board regarding communications concerning independence, and the Audit Committee considered whether KPMG maintained its independence during the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on these discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended on December 31, 2018.

9.3       Performance Objectives and Other Terms. The Committee shall set Performance Goals in its sole discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of 
A-12 
 Performance Units or Performance Shares, or both, that will be paid out to the Participants. The time period during which the Performance Goals must be met shall be called the "Performance Period". Performance Periods of Awards granted to Section 16 Persons shall, in all cases, exceed six (6) months in length (or such shorter period as may be permissible while maintaining compliance with Rule 16b-3). Each Award of Performance Units or Performance Shares shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. 
9.4       Earning of Performance Units/Shares. Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares shall be entitled to receive payout on the number and value of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals or Performance Measures have been achieved. 
9.5       Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares. Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares shall be as determined by the Committee and as evidenced in the Award Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Plan the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period. Any Shares may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form of payout of such Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award. Awards shall be paid no later than the last date permitted in order for the payment to be exempted from the definition of deferred compensation under section 409A of the Code. 
9.6       Dividends and Other Distributions. At the discretion of the Committee, Participants holding Performance Units/Shares may be entitled to receive dividend equivalents with respect to dividends declared with respect to the Shares. Such dividends may be subject to the accrual, forfeiture, or payout restrictions as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. 
9.7       Termination of Employment/Service Relationship. In the event of a Participant's Termination of Service, all Performance Units/Shares shall be forfeited by the Participant unless determined otherwise by the Committee, as set forth in the Participant's Award Agreement. Any such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the Award Agreement entered into with each Participant, need not be uniform among all Performance Units/Shares issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination. 
ARTICLE X 
STOCK-BASED AWARDS 
10.1     Stock-Based Awards. The Committee may grant other types of equity-based or equity-related Awards (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted Shares) in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Committee shall determine. Subject to Section 5.3, the Committee shall have complete discretion in determining the amount of Stock-Based Awards granted to any Participant. Stock-Based Awards shall be available as a form of payment of other Awards granted under the Plan and other earned cash-based incentive compensation. 
ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS 
11.1     Deferrals. To the extent consistent with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, the Committee may provide in an Award Agreement or another document that a Participant is permitted to defer 
A-13 
 receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award. Any such deferral election shall be subject to such rules and procedures as shall be determined by the Committee. 
11.2     409A Compliance. To the extent any provision of the Plan or any Award or action by the Board or Committee would subject any Participant to liability for interest or additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code, it will be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee. It is intended that the Plan and all Awards will comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and each Award shall be interpreted consistent with such intent. The Plan and any Award may be amended in any respect deemed necessary (including retroactively) by the Committee in order to pursue compliance with or exemption from, as applicable, Section 409A of the Code. If any deferred compensation is payable to a "specified employee" upon "separation from service," as those terms are defined in Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then payment of such amount shall be delayed for a period of six months following separation from service and paid in a lump sum on the first payroll date following the expiration of such six month period. The foregoing shall not be construed as a guarantee of any particular tax effect for Plan benefits or Awards. A Participant or beneficiary as applicable is solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on the Participant or beneficiary in connection with any payments to such Participant or beneficiary under the Plan, including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, and neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant or beneficiary harmless from any and all of such taxes and penalties. 
11.3     No Effect on Employment or Service. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate any Participant's employment or service at any time, with or without Cause. Employment with the Company or any Subsidiary is on an at-will basis only, unless otherwise provided by an applicable employment or service agreement between the Participant and the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be. 
11.4     Participation. No Participant shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under the Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award. 
11.5     Indemnification. Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Committee, to the extent permitted under state law, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (a) any loss, cost, liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan or any Award Agreement, and (b) from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's prior written approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law or otherwise, or under any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 
11.6     Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan, with respect to Awards granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. 
11.7     Beneficiary Designations. If permitted by the Committee, a Participant under the Plan may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any vested but unpaid Award shall be paid in the event of the Participant's death. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be 
A-14 
 effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such designation, any vested benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate and, subject to the terms of the Plan and of the applicable Award Agreement, any unexercised vested Award may be exercised by the administrator, executor or the personal representative of the Participant's estate. 
11.8     No Rights as Stockholder. Except to the limited extent provided in Sections 7.6 and 7.7, no Participant (nor any beneficiary thereof) shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award (or the exercise thereof), unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (or his or her beneficiary). 
11.9     Investment Representation. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required. 
11.10   Uncertificated Shares. To the extent that the Plan provides for issuance of certificates to reflect the transfer of Shares, the transfer of such Shares may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange. 
11.11   Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, or Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
ARTICLE XII 
AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, AND DURATION 
12.1     Amendment, Suspension, or Termination. The Board, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that if and to the extent required by law or to maintain the Plan's compliance with the Code, the rules of any national securities exchange (if applicable), or any other applicable law, any such amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval; and further provided, that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, take any other action with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that may be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the principal securities market on which the Shares are traded, including a reduction of the exercise price of an Option or the grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right or the exchange of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right for cash or another Award. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant. No Award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan. 
12.2     Duration of the Plan. The Plan shall become effective in accordance with Section 1.1, and subject to Section 12.1 shall remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. 
ARTICLE XIII 
TAX WITHHOLDING 
13.1     Withholding Requirements. Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or the exercise thereof), the Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold from any amounts due to the Participant from the Company, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or the exercise thereof). 
A-15 
13.2     Withholding Arrangements. The Committee, pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part, by (a) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, or (b) delivering to the Company Shares then owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement shall be deemed to include any amount that the Committee agrees may be withheld at the time any such election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered shall be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld. 
ARTICLE XIV 
CHANGE IN CONTROL 
14.1     Upon the Occurrence of Change in Control: 
(a)            Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. 
(i)            If in connection with a Change in Control, any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not continued in effect or converted into an Option to purchase or Stock Appreciation Right with respect to stock of the survivor or successor parent corporation in a manner that complies with Sections 424 and 409A of the Code, such outstanding Option(s) or Stock Appreciation Rights shall vest and become fully exercisable. 
(ii)            If outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights are continued or converted as described in Section 14.1(a)(i), then upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Termination of the holder thereof, such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall vest and become fully exercisable. 
(b)            Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. 
(i)            If in connection with a Change in Control, any outstanding Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are not continued in effect or converted into restricted shares or units, as applicable, representing interests in stock of the survivor or successor parent corporation on a basis substantially equivalent to the consideration received by stockholders of the Company in connection with the Change in Control, such outstanding Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall vest and be valued at the time of the Change in Control. 
(ii)            If any outstanding Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are continued or converted as described in Section 14.1(b)(i), then upon occurrence of a Qualifying Termination of employment of the holder thereof, such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall vest in full. 
(c)        Performance Share. 
(i)            Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or an employment agreement, upon a Change in Control, any outstanding Performance Shares shall be converted into time-vesting Restricted Stock, based on actual performance, giving effect to the transaction constituting the Change in Control. Unless otherwise specified in the Award Agreement corresponding to the Performance Shares, the number of Shares converted into Restricted Stock shall be pro-rated based on the number of days in the Performance Period occurring prior to the Change in Control, and the vesting period of such Restricted Stock shall be the time remaining 
A-16 
 in the Performance Period of the converted Performance Shares. If in connection with such Change in Control, the converted Restricted Stock is not continued in effect or converted into restricted shares or units relating to the stock of the successor or survivor parent corporation on a basis substantially equivalent the consideration, if any, received by stockholders of the Company in connection with the Change in Control, then all such outstanding Restricted Stock shall vest and be valued pursuant to Section 14.1(b)(i). 
(ii)            The Restricted Stock into which any outstanding Performance Shares are converted as described in Section 14(c)(i) shall vest upon a Qualifying Termination of the holder. 
(d)        Performance Units 
(i)            Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or an employment agreement, upon a Change in Control, any outstanding Performance Units shall be converted into time-vesting restricted cash, based on actual performance, giving effect to the transaction constituting the Change in Control. Unless otherwise specified in the Award Agreement corresponding to the Performance Units, the value converted into restricted cash shall be pro-rated based on the number of days in the Performance Period occurring prior to the Change in Control, and the vesting period of such restricted cash shall be the time remaining in the Performance Period of the converted Performance Units. 
(ii)            The restricted cash into which any outstanding Performance Units are converted as described in Section 14(d)(i) shall vest upon a Qualifying Termination of the holder. 
(e)        Qualifying Termination. For purposes of this Section, a "Qualifying Termination" shall mean a termination of employment within twenty-four months following a Change in Control (i) by the Company other than for Cause, gross negligence, or deliberate misconduct which demonstrably harms the Company or (ii) by the Participant for "good reason," if "good reason" is defined in the applicable Award Agreement or employment agreement. 
14.2      Continued or Converted. For purposes of Section 14.1(a), (b), (c), and (d) hereof, (i) no Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit shall be treated as "continued or converted" on a basis consistent with the requirements of Sections 14.1(a)(i), (b)(i), (c)(i), or (d)(i) as applicable, unless the stock underlying such Award after such continuation or conversion consists of securities of a class that is widely held and publicly traded on a U.S. national securities exchange, and (ii) no Performance Share or Performance Unit will be treated as "continued or converted" on a basis consistent with the requirements described in Section 14.1(c)(i) and 14.(d)(i) unless the performance conditions applicable to a Participant's earning of the Award are practicably susceptible of continuing measurement following the Change in Control transaction and do not effectively increase the performance required to be achieved in order for the Participant to earn any portion or level of Award. 
14.3      Section 409A. If the implementation of any of the foregoing provisions of this Article XIV would cause a Participant to incur adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, the implementation of such provision shall be delayed until the first date on which such implementation would not cause any adverse tax consequences under Section 409A. 
14.4      Conflict. The preceding sections of this Article XIV shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, unless the Committee shall have expressly provided in any applicable Award for different provisions to apply in the event of a Change in Control. For the avoidance of doubt, any such different provisions may be more or less favorable to either of the parties to the Award, but if the application of such different provisions is unclear, uncertain or ambiguous, the provisions of this Article XIV shall govern. 
A-17 
ARTICLE XV 
LEGAL CONSTRUCTION 
15.1      Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural. 
15.2      Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
15.3      Requirements of Law. The grant of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required from time to time.
