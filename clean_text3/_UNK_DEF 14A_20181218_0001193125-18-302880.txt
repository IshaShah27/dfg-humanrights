In evaluating nominees for director the Board considers, among other things, the individual's character and professional ethics, judgment, integrity, diversity, prior professional experience, background, the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other Board members, the extent to which the candidate would be desirable as a member of the Board's Audit Committee, and the candidate's willingness to devote substantial time and effort to Board responsibilities. 
Director Nominees 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR each of these nominees to hold office for a term expiring at the 2019 Annual Stockholders' Meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified.

Corporate Governance 
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
Separate CEO and Chairman 
The Company currently operates under a leadership structure in which the positions of chairman of the Board and chief executive officer have been separated, such that each position is held by a different person. Although the Board has no mandatory policy with respect to the separation of the offices of chairman and the chief executive officer, the Board believes that it is appropriate to have these as separate positions at this time on account of the varying strengths, experiences and relationships of each of these individuals in the real estate industry. Mr. Seneff serves as the chairman of the Board and has unique knowledge, experience and relationships with the Board and management and within a broad spectrum of the real estate market. Mr. Mauldin serves as our president and chief executive officer, in addition to his position of vice chairman of the Board.  Board Structure and Director Independence 
Under our organizational documents, we must have at least three but not more than fifteen directors. The Board has currently set the number of directors at five. A majority of these directors must be "independent." An "Independent Director" is defined under our Third Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the "Charter") as one who is not, and within the last two years has not been, directly or indirectly associated with the Sponsor or the Advisor by virtue of (i) ownership of an interest in the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, (ii) employment by the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, (iii) service as an officer or director of the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, (iv) performance of services, other than as a director, for the Company, (v) service as a director or trustee of more than three real estate investment trusts sponsored by the Sponsor or advised by the Advisor, or (vi) maintenance of a material business or professional relationship with the Sponsor, Advisor or any of their affiliates. An indirect relationship shall include circumstances in which a director's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers- or fathers-in-law, sons- or daughters-in-law or brothers- or sisters-in-law is or has been associated with the Sponsor, the Advisor, any of their affiliates or the Company. A business or professional relationship is considered material if the gross revenue derived by the director from the Sponsor, the Advisor and any of their affiliates exceeds five percent of either the director's annual gross revenue during either of the last two years or the director's net worth on a fair market value basis. The Board annually reviews business and charitable relationships of directors in order to make a determination as to the independence of each director. Only those directors whom the Board determines have no material relationship with us or our affiliates that would impair their independent judgment are considered independent directors. The Board has considered the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director in accordance with the elements of independence set forth in our Charter and the elements of independence in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), even though our shares are not listed on the NYSE. After performing such a review, based upon information solicited from each nominee, the Board has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Martin, Haggerty and Holladay has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company) other than as a director of the Company and each satisfies the elements of independence set forth in our Charter and in the listing standards of the NYSE, as currently in effect. There are no familial relationships between any of our directors and executive officers. 
All Board members, through the chairman of the Board or the Audit Committee Chair, have input into meeting schedules, agendas, and the other important responsibilities of the Board or the Audit Committee. 
We believe that our Board leadership structure is effective for the Company and provides for appropriate oversight of the Company's risk management, by providing balanced leadership through the separated chairman and chief executive officer positions, and by having strong independent leaders on the Board who are fully engaged and provide significant input into Board deliberations and decisions. Below is additional information about our risk oversight procedures. 
Risk Oversight 
The Audit Committee focuses on the adequacy of the Company's enterprise risk management and risk mitigation processes. The Audit Committee meets regularly to discuss the strategic direction and the issues and opportunities facing the Company in light of trends and developments in the REIT industry and general business environment. Throughout the year, the Board provides guidance to management regarding the Company's strategy and helps to refine its operating plans to implement the Company's strategy. Annually, Internal Audit presents the results of the enterprise risk assessment to the Audit Committee. The risk assessment approach includes reviewing the categories of risk the Company faces, including any fraud and business risks, as well as the likelihood of occurrence, the potential impact of those risks and mitigating measures. The involvement of the Audit Committee in setting the Company's business strategy is critical to the determination of the types and appropriate levels of risk undertaken by the Company. The Board's role in risk oversight of the Company is consistent with the Company's leadership structure, with the president and chief executive officer and other members of senior management having responsibility for assessing and managing the Company's risk exposure, and the Board and the Audit Committee providing oversight of risk management efforts.  Board Meetings and Attendance 
The Board held four (4) meetings in 2017. All directors attended 100% of the meetings of the Board. Although the Company does not have a policy on director attendance at the annual meetings of stockholders, directors are encouraged to do so. 
Committees of the Board 
Audit Committee 
The Company has a standing Audit Committee, the members of which are selected by the Board each year. The Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of Independent Directors, is chaired by an Independent Director. The current membership of the Audit Committee and other descriptive information is summarized below.

The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Forms and Literature page of our website, CNLHealthcareProperties.com. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board by providing oversight responsibilities relating to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The integrity of financial reporting;

• The annual independent audit process;

• Our policies and procedures for risk assessment and risk management; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The process to estimate the Company's net asset value per share on an annual basis.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Audit Committee engages and is responsible for the compensation and oversight of the Company's independent auditors and internal auditors. In performing these functions, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors (including private sessions) to review the results of their work. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee held a total of four (4) meetings, including with the Company's independent auditors, internal auditors and management to discuss the annual and quarterly financial reports prior to the filing of such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Each member of the Audit Committee attended 100% of the meetings. 
The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent under our Charter and the listing standards of the NYSE, as currently in effect. In addition, the Audit Committee determined that Mr. Martin is an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules and regulations of the Commission for purposes of Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  More information about the Audit Committee can be found under "Item 3 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor," beginning on page 19. 
Other Board Committees 
In August 2013, the Board initiated a process to estimate the Company's net asset value per share and created a new committee, comprised solely of Independent Directors, charged with oversight of the Company's valuation process (the "Valuation Committee"). During 2017, the Valuation Committee met once. 
Currently, the Company does not have a nominating committee or a compensation committee. The Board is of the view that it is not necessary to have a nominating committee at this time because the Board is composed of only five members, a majority of whom are "independent" (as defined under our Charter and the listing standards of the NYSE, as currently in effect). The Board does not have a compensation committee because the Company is externally advised and does not have any employees. We do not separately compensate our executive officers for their services as officers. At such time, if any, as the Company's shares of common stock are listed on a national securities exchange such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, or the Company has employees to whom it directly provides compensation, the Board will form a compensation committee, the members of which will be selected by the full Board annually. 
On April 3, 2018, the Board formed a special committee (the "Special Committee") of the Board, consisting of Messrs. Martin, Haggerty and Holladay, the Company's independent directors, to consider possible strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to (i) the listing of the Company's or one of its subsidiaries' common stock on a national securities exchange, (ii) an orderly disposition of the Company's assets or one or more of the Company's asset classes and the distribution of the net sale proceeds thereof to the stockholders of the Company and (iii) a potential business combination or other transaction with a third party or parties that provides the stockholders of the Company with cash and/or securities of a publicly traded company. 
Committee Charters and Other Corporate Governance Documents

Five Percent Stockholders 
There are no persons who are known to us to be the beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017 or October 1, 2018. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Our executive officers and directors are required under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") to file with the Commission reports regarding their ownership and changes in their ownership of the Company's securities. Copies of those reports must also be furnished to us. Based solely on a review of the copies of reports furnished to us with respect to 2017 and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that our executive officers and directors have complied in a timely manner with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements. Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act also requires persons who own more than 10% of the Company's securities to report ownership and changes in ownership to the Commission. To the Company's knowledge, there are no stockholders who own more than 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock.  Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
The Company is externally advised and has no direct employees. Certain of the Company's executive officers are executive officers of, or are on the board of managers of, the Advisor. In addition, certain directors and officers hold similar positions with CNL Securities Corp. ("Managing Dealer"), the managing dealer of the Company's public offerings and a wholly owned subsidiary of CNL. The Company incurs offering and operating expenses (including reimbursements) which in general relate to administration of the Company on an ongoing basis. In connection with services provided to the Company, affiliates are entitled to the following fees: 
Managing Dealer — The Managing Dealer is entitled to receive selling commissions and marketing support fees of up to 7% and 3%, respectively, of gross offering proceeds for shares sold, excluding shares sold pursuant to the Company's Distribution Reinvestment Plan, all or a portion of which may be paid to participating broker dealers by the Managing Dealer. No selling commissions or marketing support fees were paid to the Managing Dealer for the year ended December 31, 2017 or the six months ended June 30, 2018. 
Advisor — The Advisor has responsibility for the Company's day-to-day operations, administering the Company's accounting functions, serving as the Company's consultant in connection with policy decisions to be made by the Board and identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Company's behalf. In exchange for these services, the Advisor is entitled to receive certain fees from the Company. The Company's Independent Directors are required to review and approve the terms of the advisory agreement at least annually. The current advisory agreement continues through June 7, 2019. Pursuant to the advisory agreement as amended on March 20, 2013 (the "advisory agreement"), the Advisor and certain affiliates are entitled to receive fees and compensation in connection with the acquisition, management and sale of the Company's assets, as well as the refinancing of debt obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. In addition, the Advisor and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of actual costs incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with the Company's organizational, offering, acquisition and operating activities. Pursuant to the advisory agreement, the Advisor receives investment services fees equal to 1.85% of the purchase price of properties (including its proportionate share of properties acquired through joint ventures) for services rendered in connection with the selection, evaluation, structure and purchase of assets. In addition, the Advisor is entitled to receive a monthly asset management fee of 0.08334% of the average real estate asset value (as defined in the advisory agreement) of the Company's properties, including its proportionate share of properties owned through joint ventures and the outstanding value of any loans made. The Advisor will also receive a financing coordination fee for services rendered with respect to refinancing of any debt obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries equal to 1.0% of the gross amount of the refinancing. 
The Company will pay the Advisor a disposition fee in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the sale of real property, the lesser of (A) one-half of a competitive real estate commission, or (B) 1% of the sales price of such property, and (ii) in the case of the sale of any asset other than real property or securities, 1% of the sales price of such asset, if the Advisor, its affiliates or related parties provide a substantial amount of services, as determined by the Company's independent directors, in connection with the sale of one or more assets (including a sale of all of its assets or the sale of it or a portion thereof). The Company will not pay the Advisor a disposition fee in connection with the sale of investments that are securities; however, a disposition fee in the form of a usual and customary brokerage fee may be paid to an affiliate or related party of the Advisor, if such affiliate is properly licensed. 
Under the advisory agreement and the Company's articles of incorporation, the Advisor will be entitled to receive certain subordinated incentive fees upon (a) sales of assets and/or (b) a listing (which would also include the receipt by the Company's stockholders of securities that are approved for trading on a national securities exchange in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock as a result of a merger, share acquisition or similar transaction). However, if a listing occurs, the Advisor will not be entitled to receive an incentive fee on subsequent sales of assets. The incentive fees are calculated pursuant to formulas set forth in both the advisory agreement and the Company's articles of incorporation. All incentive fees payable to the Advisor are subordinated to the return to investors of their invested capital plus a 6% cumulative, non-compounded annual return on their invested capital. Upon termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement by the Advisor for good reason (as defined in the advisory agreement) or by the Company other than for cause (as defined in the advisory agreement), a listing or sale of assets after such termination or non-renewal will entitle the Advisor to receive a pro-rated portion of the applicable subordinated incentive fee. 
In addition, the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to receive fees that are usual and customary for comparable services in connection with the financing, development, construction or renovation of a property, subject to approval of the Board, including a majority of its independent directors.  Pursuant to the advisory agreement, the Advisor shall reimburse the Company the amount by which the total operating expenses paid or incurred by the Company exceed, in any four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with the Expense Year ending June 30, 2013, the greater of 2% of average invested assets or 25% of net income (as defined in the advisory agreement) ("Limitation"), unless a majority of the Company's independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors ("Expense Cap Test"). In performing the Expense Cap Test, the Company uses operating expenses on a GAAP basis after making adjustments for the benefit of expense support under the Expense Support Agreements. For the Expense Year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not incur operating expenses in excess of the Limitation. 
Property Manager — Pursuant to a property management and leasing agreement, as amended in 2012 and 2013 (the "property management agreement"), but which terminated in accordance with its terms on June 28, 2018, with CNL Healthcare Manager Corp. (the "Property Manager"), the Property Manager was entitled to receive property management fees of (a) 2% of annual gross rental revenues from single tenant properties, and (b) 4% of annual gross rental revenues from multi-tenant properties. Pursuant to the property management agreement, in the event that the Company contracted directly with a third-party property manager, the Company may pay the Property Manager an oversight fee of up to 1% of annual gross revenues of the property managed; however, in no event would the Company pay both a property management fee and an oversight fee with respect to the same property. The property management agreement provided for the Company to pay to the Property Manager a construction management fee equal to 5% of hard and soft costs associated with the initial construction or renovation of a property, or with the management and oversight of expansion projects and other capital improvements, in those cases in which the value of the construction, renovation, expansion or improvements exceeded (i) 10% of the initial purchase price of the property, and (ii) $1.0 million, which fee was due and payable upon completion of such projects. 
On April 3, 2018, the Company and the Property Manager agreed that the property management agreement would expire on its stated termination date of June 28, 2018 and not be extended for a subsequent six-year term. Such determination was taken in part due to the Company's having substantially completed its acquisition, lease-up and development stages and having reached the maturation phase of the Company's lifecycle, thus diminishing the need for the services provided by the Property Manager. The duties previously undertaken by the Property Manager are being performed by the Advisor. No early termination fees or penalties were paid by the Company to the Property Manager in connection with the expiration of the property management agreement. 
Expense Support Agreements — Pursuant to expense support agreements entered into in March 2013 and August 2013, the Company's Advisor and Property Manager agreed to accept certain payments in the form of forfeitable restricted shares of the Company's common stock ("Restricted Stock") in lieu of cash for services rendered under their respective agreements with the Company in an amount equal to the positive excess, if any, of (a) aggregate stockholder cash distributions declared for the applicable quarter, over (b) the Company's aggregate modified funds from operations, as defined in the expense support agreements. The Advisor expense support amount will be determined for each calendar quarter, on a non-cumulative basis, on each quarter-end date ("Original Determination Date"). The Property Manager expense support amount was determined for each calendar quarter, on a non-cumulative basis, after the calculation of the Advisor expense support amount pursuant to the Property Manager expense support agreement on each quarter-end date. The Restricted Stock is subordinated and forfeited to the extent that shareholders do not receive their invested capital plus a 6% cumulative non-compounded annual return upon ultimate liquidity of the Company. Any amounts settled, and for which restricted stock shares were issued, pursuant to the expense support agreements have been permanently settled and the Company has no further obligation to pay such amounts.
In March 2016, the Company's board of directors approved the third amended and restated expense support agreements with both the Advisor and Property Manager that were effective January 1, 2016. These amendments changed the calculation and determination date of the respective affiliate's expense support amounts from each calendar quarter on a non-cumulative basis, to each calendar year on a cumulative year-to-date basis ("Amended Determination Date"). In February 2017, the Company's board of directors approved and the Company entered into the fourth amended and restated expense support agreements with both the Advisor and Property Manager that were effective January 1, 2017. These amendments limit the annual expense support amount, in the aggregate, to an annualized four percent of the weighted average of the Board's most recent determination of NAV per share and change the calculation to exclude the impact of completed development properties for a specified period of time after the property is placed into service (as defined in the agreements).  The aforementioned amendments, along with the original expense support agreements and previous amendments, govern the fees and expenses charged by the Advisor and Property Manager to the Company. For each quarter within a calendar expense support year, the Company records a proportional estimate of the cumulative year-to-date period based on an estimate of expense support amounts for the calendar expense support year. Moreover, in exchange for services rendered and in consideration of the expense support provided, the Company shall issue, within 90 days following each Amended Determination Date, a number of shares of Restricted Stock equal to the quotient of the expense support amounts provided by the Advisor and Property Manager for the preceding calendar year divided by the then-current estimated NAV per share of common stock. The terms of the expense support agreements automatically renew for consecutive one year periods, subject to the right of the Advisor or Property Manager to terminate their respective agreements upon 30 days' written notice. 
CNL Capital Markets Corp — CNL Capital Markets Corp. ("CCM") provides certain administrative services related to the ownership of the Company's shares. In March 2013, the Board approved an amendment to its agreement with CCM pursuant to which the agreement, unless terminated, will renew for consecutive one year periods. CCM receives a sliding flat annual rate (payable monthly) based on the average number of investor accounts that will be open over the term of the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million, and $0.5 million in such fees, respectively. These amounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

(2)  The number of restricted stock shares granted to the Advisor in lieu of payment in cash is determined by  dividing the expense support amount for the respective determination date by the then-current public offering price or NAV per share.  
(3)  Restricted stock shares are comprised of approximately 1.3 million issued to the Advisor as of  December 31, 2017. No fair value was assigned to the restricted stock shares as the shares were valued at zero, which represents the lowest possible value estimated at vesting. In addition, the restricted stock shares were treated as unissued  for financial reporting purposes because the vesting criteria had not been met as of December 31, 2017.  
(4)  The cash distributions have been recognized as compensation expense as issued and included in general and  administrative expense.  
(5)  This represents the number of shares issued to the Advisor as stock distributions on its restricted stock  shares. The par value of the stock distributions has been recognized as compensation expense as issued and included in general and administrative expense.

Policies Regarding Transactions with Certain Affiliates 
Item 404 of the Commission's Regulation S-K requires disclosure by the Company of any transaction between the Company and any related persons the amount of which exceeds $120,000 in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related parties include any executive officers, directors, director nominees, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the Company's voting securities, immediate family members of any of the foregoing persons, and any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed and in which such person has 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest. 
In order to reduce or eliminate certain potential conflicts of interest, the Charter contains restrictions, and/or the Board has adopted written procedures, relating to (i) transactions between the Company and its Advisor or its affiliates, (ii) certain future offerings, and (iii) allocation of properties and loans among certain affiliated entities. These restrictions include the following:  Provision of goods and services—No goods or services will be provided by the Advisor or its affiliates to the Company except for transactions in which the Advisor or its affiliates provide those goods or services in accordance with the Charter, or, if a majority of the Company's directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in such transactions approve such transactions as fair and reasonable and on terms and conditions not less favorable to the Company than those available from unaffiliated third parties. 
Purchase or lease of properties—The Company will not purchase or lease properties in which the Sponsor, the Advisor, the directors or any affiliate has an interest without the determination by a majority of the directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in such transaction that such transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company and at a price no greater than the cost of the asset to the Sponsor, Advisor, director or affiliate unless there is substantial justification for any amount that exceeds such cost and such excess amount is determined to be reasonable. In no event shall the Company acquire any such asset at an amount in excess of its current appraised value. Further, the Company will not sell or lease properties to the Sponsor, Advisor, a director or any affiliates thereof unless a majority of the directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in such transaction determine the transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company. 
Loans to affiliates—The Company will not make loans to the Sponsor, the Advisor, the directors, or any affiliate thereof, except (i) mortgage loans subject to the restrictions governing mortgage loans in the Charter or (ii) to its wholly owned subsidiaries or to ventures or partnerships in which the Company holds an interest. Any loans to the Company by the Sponsor, the Advisor, the directors or any affiliates thereof must be approved by a majority of the directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in such transaction as fair, competitive, commercially reasonable, and no less favorable to the Company than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 
Borrowing from affiliates – The Company will not borrow money from the Sponsor, the Advisor, the directors or any affiliate thereof, unless a majority of the directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction conclude that the transaction is fair, competitive, commercially reasonable and no less favorable to the Company than loans between unaffiliated parties under the same circumstances. 
Voting of shares—With respect to shares owned by the Advisor, the directors or any affiliate thereof, neither the Advisor, nor the directors, nor any of their affiliates may vote or consent on matters submitted to the Company's stockholders regarding the removal of the Advisor, the directors, or any affiliate thereof or any transaction between the Company and any of them. In determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares necessary to approve a matter on which the Advisor, the directors, and any affiliate thereof may not vote or consent, any shares owned by any of them shall not be included. 
Suitable investment opportunities—Certain of the Company's directors and executive officers also serve as directors and executive officers of CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc., a newly formed corporation that intends to operate as a REIT, sponsored by our Sponsor. Although the Company has different investment objectives than CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc., an investment opportunity may be suitable for both the Company and CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc. The Company's Board and the Advisor have agreed that, in the event an investment opportunity is presented to both the Advisor's Investment Committee and the investment committee of the advisor for CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc. and it is determined that the opportunity may be suitable for both the Company and CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc. and for which both entities have sufficient uninvested funds, the investment opportunity will be offered to the entities on an alternating basis as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The first investment opportunity that meets this criteria will be first offered to the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The second opportunity that meets this criteria will be first offered to CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc.  (whether or not the Company passed on the first investment opportunity, and whether or not CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc. accepted an investment in the first investment opportunity); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Thereafter, each offer of any investment opportunities will alternate on the foregoing basis. It shall be the  duty of the Board, including the independent directors, to ensure that these policies are applied fairly to the Company.  
[END TABLE]
This policy will continue in effect until such time as the Company's Sponsor no longer owns or controls the Advisor and the advisor of CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc.  Certain public or private entities affiliated with the Company's Sponsor and/or CNL are bound by conflict resolution procedures that may impact the investments that are available to the Company. In particular, certain of these public and private entities affiliated with the Company's Sponsor or CNL, some of which invest in assets similar to those in which the Company may invest, require that if an investment opportunity becomes available which is suitable for such sponsor- and/or CNL-affiliated entities, then the entity which has had the longest period of time elapse since it was offered an investment opportunity will first be offered the investment opportunity. For purposes of this conflict resolution procedure for these other entities, an investment opportunity will be considered "offered" when the opportunity is presented to the applicable board of directors for its consideration. In addition to various other factors, the determination as to whether or not an investment opportunity is suitable for more than one program will be determined based on the effect of the acquisition both on diversification of each program's investments by types of properties and geographic area, and on diversification of the tenants of the properties, the anticipated cash flow of each program, the size of the investment, the amount of funds available to each program, and the length of time such funds have been available for investment. A subsequent development regarding the investment opportunity, such as a delay in the closing of a property or a delay in the construction of a property, may cause any such investment to be more appropriate for an entity other than the entity which committed to make the investment. Although neither the Company nor its Advisor is bound by these conflict resolution procedures, the Company and its Advisor may be restricted by such procedures. 
Item 2 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor 
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board appointed the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered certified public accounting firm, as our independent auditor for 2018 (referred to throughout this proxy statement as the "independent auditor"). Although ratification by the stockholders is not required by law or the Company's governance documents, the Company believes ratification of this appointment is good corporate practice because the audit of the Company's books and records is a matter of importance to the Company's stockholders. In the event this ratification is not received, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. However, the Board may nevertheless elect to retain them. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent auditor at any time during the year, if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to questions from the Company's stockholders. 
Fees Paid to the Independent Auditor 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the audit of our annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and fees billed for other services rendered (for audit and non-audit services and all "out-of-pocket" costs incurred in connection with these services) by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during these periods. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit fees    $ 735,000      $ 994,250   
 Audit-related fees      —          —     
 Tax fees      582,139        492,957   
 All other fees      —          —     
 Total    $ 1,317,139      $ 1,487,207   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees – Consists of professional services rendered in connection with the annual audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reviews of the Company's interim financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Audit fees also include fees for services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that are closely related to the audit and in many cases could only be provided by the Company's independent auditors. Such services include consents related to the Company's registration statements, assistance with, and review of, other documents filed with the Commission and accounting advice on completed transactions.  Audit-Related Fees – Consists of services related to audits of properties acquired, due diligence services related to contemplated property acquisitions or dispositions and accounting consultations. There were no professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that would be classified as audit-related fees during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
Tax Fees – Consists of services related to corporate tax compliance, including review of corporate tax returns, review of the tax treatments for certain expenses and tax due diligence relating to acquisitions. 
All Other Fees – There were no professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that would be classified as other fees during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 
Under the Company's Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors in order to assure that the provisions of such services do not impair the auditor's independence. The policy, as described below and set forth in the Audit Committee Charter sets forth conditions and procedures for such pre-approval of services to be performed by the independent auditor and utilizes both a framework of general pre-approval for certain specified services and specific pre-approval for all other services. 
The annual audit services, as well as all audit-related services (assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the auditor's review of the financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor), requires the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may, however, grant general pre-approval for other audit services, which are those services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide (such as comfort letters or consents). The Audit Committee has pre-approved all tax services and may grant general pre-approval for those permissible non-audit services that it has classified as "all other services" because it believes such services are routine and recurring services, and would not impair the independence of the auditor. 
The fee amounts for all services to be provided by the independent auditor are established annually by the Audit Committee, and any proposed service fees exceeding approved levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Requests to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee are submitted to the Audit Committee by the independent auditor, the chief financial officer and the chief executive officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with the Commission's rules on auditor independence. 
Audit Committee Report 
The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act except to the extent that the Company incorporates it by specific reference. 
Review and Discussions with Management. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the management of the Company. The Audit Committee also discussed with the Company's senior management the process for certifications by the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer required by the Commission and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for certain of the Company's filings with the Commission. 
Review and Discussions with Independent Auditors. The Audit Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered certified public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees," which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the   audit of the Company's financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee has reviewed the selection, application and disclosure of the Company's critical accounting policies. The Audit Committee has also received written disclosures and letters from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by Rule 3524 and Rule 3526 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence," and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP their independence from the Company. 
Conclusion. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the Commission. 
The Audit Committee:

Other Information about the Meeting 
Voting and Attendance Information 
How to vote: You may vote by proxy by internet, telephone or mail, or you may attend the meeting and vote in person. Please see your proxy card or Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for more detailed voting instructions, or refer to the information your bank, broker or other nominee provided to you. If you vote by proxy before the meeting, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the meeting by filing with our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation, submitting a proxy bearing a later date, or attending the meeting and voting in person. Please see "Attending the Meeting in Person" below for information about attending the meeting. Even if you plan to attend, we request that you vote by proxy promptly. If you attend the meeting and wish to vote in person, your proxy will not be used. 
Who can vote: Only stockholders of record of CNL Healthcare Properties common stock as of the close of business on October 10, 2018 are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of that date, we had outstanding approximately 175,305,499 shares of common stock, the only class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share registered in their names on the record date with respect to all matters to be acted upon at the meeting. If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, see "Voting by Street Name Holders" below regarding directing your record holder on how to vote your shares. 
Quorum: The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of 50% of the shares outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes (defined below) will be considered as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
Voting by Street Name Holders: If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker or nominee (the "street name holder") along with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your street name holder how to vote your shares; and the street name holder is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give instructions to your street name holder at least ten days before the meeting, the street name holder will be entitled to vote your shares in its discretion on Item 3 (Ratification of Independent Auditor), but will not be able to vote your shares on any other proposal, and your shares will be counted as "broker non-votes" on Item 1 (Election of Directors). 
How your votes are counted and the votes required for approval: Shares represented by valid proxies received will be voted in the manner specified on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated on the proxy, the proxy will be voted as recommended by our Board. If other matters are properly presented at the meeting for consideration, the persons appointed as proxies on your proxy card will have the discretion to vote on these matters for you. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on each matter will be required to elect each director and to ratify the appointment of our independent auditor. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered as votes cast with respect to the applicable matter and, therefore, will have no effect on the voting results.  Attending the Meeting in Person: Only stockholders of record as of the record date, October 10, 2018, or their proxy holders and our guests may attend the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Personal photo identification may be required to enter the meeting. Below is additional information regarding required documentation necessary for admission to the meeting, which will be held at CNL Center at City Commons, Tower I, 13th Floor, 450 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801. To obtain directions to the 2018 Annual Meeting, please call the Company at (407) 650-1000. 
The use of cameras at the meeting is prohibited and cameras will not be allowed into the meeting or any other adjacent areas, except by credentialed media. We realize that many mobile phones have built-in cameras. While these phones may be brought into the venue, the camera function may not be used at any time. For safety and security reasons, bags, briefcases and other items will be subject to security check. 
If your shares are held in street name (in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee), please bring to the meeting an account statement or letter from the street name holder indicating that you beneficially owned the shares on October 10, 2018, the record date for voting. You may not vote your shares in person at the meeting, unless you obtain a legal proxy from the record holder that holds your shares. 
Revocation of Proxies 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote before the proxies are voted at the 2018 Annual Meeting. You may change your vote using the internet or telephone methods described herein, prior to the applicable cutoff time before the 2018 Annual Meeting, in which case only your latest internet or telephone proxy will be counted. Alternatively, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote by signing and returning a new form of proxy dated as of a later date, or by attending the 2018 Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy, unless you properly vote at the meeting, or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation to the Company prior to the meeting at the following address: CNL Healthcare Properties, Inc., CNL Center at City Commons, 450 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32801, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
Stockholder Proposals and Nominations for the 2019 Annual Stockholders' Meeting 
In order for proposals of stockholders to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials relating to the annual meeting of stockholders in 2019 pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, they must be received a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and send proxy materials for that meeting. The Company expects to announce the date by which such proposals must be submitted in a subsequent report filed by the Company on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act. Proposals should be sent to: Corporate Secretary, CNL Healthcare Properties, Inc. CNL Center at City Commons, 450 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801.    In order to avoid controversy, stockholders should submit their proposals by means, including electronic means, that permit them to prove the date of delivery. 
Under our bylaws, in order for a stockholder to bring business before or to make a proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act or to propose director nominations at an annual meeting, the stockholder must give written notice to our Corporate Secretary not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The notice must contain specified information about the proposed business or each nominee and the stockholder making the proposal or nomination. If the annual meeting is scheduled for a date that is more than 30 days prior to or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, the notice given by the stockholder must be received not earlier than 120 days prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of 90 days prior to such annual meeting. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail or internet, proxies may be solicited by telephone, facsimile or in person by directors and officers of the Company, or certain employees of CNL Capital Markets Corp., CNL Securities Corp., and affiliates of our Advisor, without special compensation therefor. In addition, we have retained Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $8,500, plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. All expenses of this solicitation, including the cost of preparing and mailing this proxy statement, and the reimbursement of brokerage houses and other nominees for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners of stock, will be paid by us.  Elimination of Duplicative Annual Meeting Materials 
Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may be "householding" our proxy statements and annual reports. This means that only one copy of the proxy statement or annual report to stockholders may have been sent to multiple stockholders in one household. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of either document to stockholders who write or call us at the following address or telephone number: CNL Center at City Commons, 450 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801, Attn: Corporate Secretary, telephone: 866-650-0650. Stockholders wishing to receive separate copies of the proxy statement or annual report to stockholders in the future, or stockholders currently receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement or the annual report who would prefer that a single copy of each be delivered, should contact their bank, broker or other nominee record holder or Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions, Inc. at (855) 928-4482. 
Other Matters 
The Board of Directors does not know of any business to be presented at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders other than the matters described in this proxy statement. If other business is properly presented for consideration at the meeting, the proxies will vote the shares in their discretion.  ANNEX 1
