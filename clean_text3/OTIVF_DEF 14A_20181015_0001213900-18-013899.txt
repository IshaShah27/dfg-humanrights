PROXY STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being sent by On Track Innovations Ltd. (the "Company") to the holders of record of the Company's outstanding ordinary shares on October 12, 2018 (the "Record Date") fixed by the Company's Board of Directors as described hereunder. The accompanying proxy is being solicited by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), for use at our 2018 Annual General Meeting (the "Meeting"), to be held on Tuesday, November 20, 2018, at 5:00 P.M. Israel time, at our offices, Z.H.R. Industrial Zone, Rosh Pina, Israel, 1200000 and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. Directors, officers and employees of the Company may also assist in the solicitation of proxies by mail, telephone, telefax, in person or otherwise, without additional compensation.  Brokers, custodians and fiduciaries will be requested to forward proxy soliciting materials to the owners of the Ordinary Shares held in their names and the Company will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the distribution of such proxy materials.
The Board has fixed October 12, 2018 as the Record Date for the Meeting. Only shareholders of record on the Record Date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. On October 12, 2018, there were 41,294,377 outstanding Ordinary Shares. Each Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote per share. Subject to the provisions of Israeli law and pursuant to the Articles of Association of the Company, no business may be transacted at any shareholder meeting unless a quorum is present when the meeting begins. The quorum required for a meeting of shareholders is at least two shareholders present in person or by proxy, holding in the aggregate at least one third (33 1/3%) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares as of the Record Date (the "Quorum"). Abstentions will not be counted with respect to the items below, but will be counted in determining if a Quorum is present.  Broker non-votes, as defined below, are counted in determining if a Quorum is present.
All Ordinary Shares represented in person or by valid proxies received by the Company prior to the Cut-Off Date (as defined below), and not revoked, will be voted as specified in the proxies or voting instructions.  Votes that are left blank will be voted as recommended by the Board. With regard to other matters that may properly come before the Meeting, votes will be cast at the discretion of the proxies.
Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed "non-routine." Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to give voting instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker or nominee can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" matters.  In the event that a broker, bank, or other agent indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a non-routine proposal, then those shares will be treated as broker non-votes.  Because Items No. 1 and 2 in this proxy statement are non-routine proposals, your broker, bank or other agent will not be entitled to vote on these proposals without your instructions. Item No. 3 is a routine proposal, so your broker, bank or other agents will be entitled to vote on those proposals without your instruction. No vote is required for Item No. 4.
Any shareholder who has submitted a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted, by written notice addressed to and received by our Secretary, by submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, but not after the Cut-Off Date, or by electing to vote in person at the Meeting. The mere presence at the Meeting of the person appointing a proxy does not, however, revoke the appointment.
We will not be able to count a proxy card unless we receive it at our principal executive offices at Z.H.R. Industrial Zone, P.O. Box 32, Rosh Pina, Israel, 1200000, or at our proxy agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. at Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way Edgewood, NY 11717, in the enclosed envelope, by Saturday, November 17, 2018, at 5:00 P.M. Israel time, which is Saturday, November 17, 2018 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time ("Cut-Off Date"). You may also vote by telephone or over the Internet on our proxy agent's website at www.proxyvote.com until the Cut-Off Date by following the instructions included on the enclosed proxy card.
Our website address and our proxy agent's website address are included several times in this proxy statement as a textual reference only, and the information in these websites is not incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. ITEM NO. 1 - ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMEDEXECUTIVE OFFICERS ("SAY-ON-PAY VOTE")
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and related rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are including a separate proposal subject to shareholder vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (as defined below) listed in the Summary Compensation Table as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K.  To learn more about our executive compensation, see "Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers" elsewhere in this proxy statement.
Our compensation policy for our Named Executive Officers is designed to reward high performance and innovation, to promote accountability and to ensure that executive interests are aligned with the interests of our shareholders. The following is a summary of the primary components of our Named Executive Officers' compensation. We urge our shareholders to review the "Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers" section of this proxy statement and related compensation tables for more information.
One component of our compensation program is base compensation or salary. We design base salaries to fall within a competitive range of the companies against which we compete for executive talent. Generally, the base salary established for an individual Named Executive Officer reflects many inputs, including our Chief Executive Officer's assessment of the Named Executive Officer's performance, the level of responsibility of the Named Executive Officer, and competitive pay levels based on salaries paid to employees with similar roles and responsibilities at our peer group companies.
Another component of our compensation program is cash bonuses. We structure our cash bonus award program to reward Named Executive Officers for our Company's successful performance, and for each individual's contribution to that performance.
A third component of our compensation program is equity awards. We grant share options to our Named Executive Officers in order to align their interests with the interests of our shareholders by tying the value delivered to our Named Executive Officers to the value of our Ordinary Shares. We also believe that share option grants to our Named Executive Officers provide them with long-term incentives that will aid in retaining executive talent by providing opportunities to be compensated through the Company's performance and rewarding executives for creating shareholder value over the long-term.
At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders held on November 21, 2017, we provided our shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. Over 95% of the votes cast on this "say-on-pay vote" were voted in favor of the proposal. We have considered the say-on-pay vote and we believe that strong support from our shareholders for the say-on-pay vote indicates that our shareholders are supportive of our approach to executive compensation. In the future, we will continue to consider the outcome of our say-on-pay votes when making compensation decisions regarding the Named Executive Officers. At our extraordinary shareholders meeting held in May 2014, our shareholders also voted in favor of the proposal to hold say-on-pay votes annually. We expect to conduct the next advisory vote at our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.
The vote on this proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  To the extent there is any significant vote against our Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee of our Board will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of shareholders.
Our Board believes that the information provided in this proxy statement demonstrates that our Named Executive Officer compensation is designed to provide incentives and rewards for both our short-term and long-term performance, and is structured to motivate the Company's Named Executive Officers to meet our strategic objectives, thereby maximizing total return to shareholders.
Therefore, it is proposed that the following resolution be adopted at the Meeting:
"RESOLVED, to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables and narrative discussion set forth in this proxy statement."
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares voting on the matter is required to approve this resolution, provided either (i) included in such majority is at least a majority of the Ordinary Shares of shareholders who are non-controlling1 shareholders nor having a personal interest in said resolution; or (ii) the total number of Ordinary Shares of shareholders specified in clause (i) who voted against this resolution does not exceed two percent of the voting rights in the Company. Since abstentions are not considered votes cast, they will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Broker non-votes will not impact the results of the vote on executive compensation, but will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum.
1 Under the Israeli Companies Law of 1999 (the "Companies Law") , in general, a person will be deemed to be a controlling shareholder if the person has the power to direct the activities of the Company, other than by reason of being a director or other office holder of the Company, and you are deemed to have a personal interest if any member of your immediate family (spouse, sibling, parent, grandparent or each of the foregoing with respect to your spouse or their spouse) has a personal interest in the adoption of the proposal. In addition, you are deemed to have a personal interest if a company, other than the Company, that is affiliated with you has a personal interest in the adoption of the proposal. Such company is a company in which you or a member of your immediate family serves as a director or chief executive officer, has the right to appoint a director or the chief executive officer, or owns 5% or more of the outstanding shares. You are also deemed to have a personal interest if you are voting another person's shares pursuant to a proxy provided by a shareholder who has a personal interest in the said resolution, even if you do not have a personal interest in the said resolution. ITEM NO. 2- SALARY INCREASE TO MR. SHLOMI COHEN, 
A DIRECTOR AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY
In August 2015, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Cohen with respect to Mr. Cohen's employment as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and its subsidiaries starting August 11, 2015, in consideration of a monthly gross salary of New Israeli Shekels ("NIS") 90,000 and other standard benefits. On November 30, 2016, the Compensation Committee and the Board approved a ten percent increase to Mr. Cohen's monthly gross salary effective December 1, 2016 and on February 6, 2017, the Compensation Committee and the Board approved an additional ten percent increase to Mr. Cohen's salary effective January 1, 2017, so that Mr. Cohen's current monthly salary is equal to NIS 108,900.
On October 11, 2018, following a review of Mr. Cohen's performance the Compensation Committee and the Board approved an additional ten percent increase to Mr. Cohen's monthly gross salary effective January 1, 2019, so that Mr. Cohen's monthly gross salary shall be NIS 119,790. The said monthly gross salary is within the framework of the Compensation Policy of the Company.
The following is a summary of the main current terms of the employment of Mr. Shlomi Cohen:

Equity:  Currently Mr. Cohen has options to acquire 540,000 Ordinary          Shares of the Company. As of October 1, 2018, 326,667 of such options are vested.

The issuance of such options will be subject to the          discretion and approval of both the Company's Compensation Committee and the Board.   Mr. Cohen, like all of our incumbent Named Executive Officers          and our directors, is entitled to acceleration of the vesting of any unvested share options and restricted shares in the event          of a change of control of the Company.

For additional information see "Summary Compensation Table" on page 7 below and the description of our employment agreement with Mr. Shlomi Cohen on page 9 below.
Our Compensation Committee and Board believe that the aforesaid compensation is designed to provide incentives and rewards for both our short-term and long-term performance, and is structured to motivate Mr. Cohen to meet our objectives, thereby maximizing total return to shareholders.
Therefore, it is proposed that the following resolution be adopted at the Meeting:
"RESOLVED, to approve the salary increase of Mr. Cohen and all other terms and provisions of his compensation terms, as described above in this proxy statement."
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares voting on the matter is required to approve this resolution, provided either (i) included in such majority is at least a majority of the Ordinary Shares of shareholders who are non-controlling2 shareholders nor having a personal interest in said resolution; or (ii) the total number of Ordinary Shares of shareholders specified in clause (i) who voted against this resolution does not exceed two percent of the voting rights in the Company. Since abstentions are not considered votes cast, they will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Broker non-votes will not impact the results of the vote on executive compensation, but will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum.
2 See footnote 1 above. ITEM NO. 3 - APPOINTMENT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND
AUTHORIZATION OF AUDIT COMMITTEE DETERMINATION OF REMUNERATION
Our Audit Committee and Board have recommended that Somekh Chaikin, a member of KPMG International ("Somekh Chaikin"), be re-appointed as our independent registered public accounting firm to perform the audit of our consolidated financial statements until the 2019 annual general meeting of shareholders. Somekh Chaikin confirmed that they have no relationship with the Company or with any affiliate of the Company, except as auditors. A representative of Somekh Chaikin is not expected to be present at the Meeting.
Shareholder approval of the appointment of Somekh Chaikin as our independent registered public accounting firm until the 2019 annual general meeting of shareholders, is required under the Companies Law. Our Audit Committee and Board believe that such appointment is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Shareholder approval is further necessary under the Companies Law in order to delegate the authority to fix the remuneration of our independent registered public accounting firm. Subject to the approval of this proposal, the Board, with the recommendation of our Audit Committee, will fix the remuneration of Somekh Chaikin in accordance with the volume and nature of their services to the Company.
Proposed Resolution
It is proposed that the following resolution be adopted at the Meeting:
"RESOLVED, to appoint Somekh Chaikin, a member of KPMG International, as our independent registered public accounting firm until the 2019 annual general meeting of shareholders, and to authorize the Board, upon the recommendation of our Audit Committee, to determine the remuneration of Somekh Chaikin in accordance with the volume and nature of their services."
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares voting on the matter is required to approve this resolution. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Because this is a routine matter, there will not be any broker non-votes. ITEM NO. 4 - PRESENTATION OF 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company's financial information for the year ended December 31, 2017, is contained in our Annual Report, available at www.sec.gov (where the contents of the SEC's website are not part of this proxy statement).

In accordance with requirements and limitations set forth in the Companies Law, we adopted a Compensation Policy, which was formulated by our Compensation Committee, approved by our Board and recommended to our shareholders, which approved the adoption of the Compensation Policy at our annual general meeting held on December 6, 2013. Pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Law, on December 15, 2016, an Amended and Restated Compensation Policy was approved at our annual general meeting.
The Compensation Policy sets rules and guidelines with respect to our compensation strategy for executive officers, and is designed to provide for the retention of, and to attract, highly qualified executives. The Policy is designed to balance competitive compensation of executive officers with our financial resources, while creating appropriate incentives considering, inter alia, risk management factors arising from our business, executive compensation benchmarks used in the industry, our size (including without limitation, sales volume and number of employees), the nature of our business and our then current cash flow situation, in order to promote our long-term goals, work plan, policies and the interests of our shareholders.
The Compensation Policy is designed to allow us to create a full compensation package for each of our executives based on common principles. With respect to variable compensation components, the Compensation Policy is designed to allow us to consider each executive's contribution in achieving our short-term and long-term strategic goals and in maximizing its profits from long-term perspective and in accordance with the executive's position.
The Compensation Policy further provides for an annual performance bonus payable to executive officers. The payment of such bonus is tied to long-term corporate performance, rather than short-term stock market performance. Bonuses are paid in accordance with specific performance targets and based, among others, upon the following factors: (i) the Company's achievement of certain financial performance metrics, consisting of annual revenue targets, EBITDA target, each based on our annual budget; (ii) achievement by the respective executive of certain predetermined objectives; and (iii) other discretionary considerations, taking into account tangible and intangible performance factors, including the executive's relative contribution to the Company.
Bonus payments shall not exceed, in the case of a Chief Executive Officer, an aggregate amount equivalent to 12 months' base salary, and for other executive officers, an aggregate amount equivalent to nine months' base salary of the respective executive. Employment Agreements
We maintain written employment and related agreements with all of our current executive officers. These agreements provide for monthly salaries and contributions by us to executive insurance and vocational studies funds. The employment agreements of certain executive officers provide for the achievement of an annual bonus, as described above. In addition, we may decide to grant our executive officers stock options from time to time. All of our executive officers' employment and related agreements contain provisions regarding noncompetition, confidentiality of information and assignment of inventions. The enforceability of covenants not to compete in Israel is unclear.
We have the following written agreements and other arrangements concerning compensation with our current executive officers: Outstanding Equity Awards At Fiscal Year-End
The following table shows options to purchase our ordinary shares outstanding on December 31, 2017 held by each of our Named Executive Officers (as of December 31, 2017, Mr. Tamir Ben-Yoseph did not own any options). Director Compensation for 2017

 Our executive directors do not receive additional separate compensation for their service on the Board or any committee of the Board. During 2017, our non-executive directors were reimbursed for their expenses for each board meeting and committee meeting attended and in addition received the foregoing compensation with respect to attendance in such meetings. The aggregate amount paid by us to our non-executive directors for their service during 2017 was $119,709.
See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" for information on beneficial ownership of our shares by our directors and executive officers. We have no outstanding loans to any of our directors or executive officers. Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions; and Director Independence
Our policy is to enter into transactions with related parties on terms that are on the whole no less favorable to us than those that would be available from unaffiliated parties at arm's length.  
Agreements with Directors and Officers
We have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers as mentioned above. In addition, we have granted options to purchase our Ordinary Shares to our officers, as mentioned elsewhere in this proxy statement.
Other than described above, none of our directors, executive officers of 5% shareholders has any relationship with the Company besides serving as directors.
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
We have engaged Somekh Chaikin, a member form of KPMG International, as our principal independent registered public accounting firm until the 2018 annual general meeting. Under Item No. 3 above, we are seeking shareholder approval to appoint Somekh Chaikin until our 2019 annual general meeting.  
Our Audit Committee is generally responsible for the oversight of our independent auditors' work. The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by Somekh Chaikin. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services, as further described below. The Audit Committee sets forth the basis for its pre-approval in detail, listing the particular services or categories of services which are pre-approved, and setting forth a specific budget for such services. Additional services may be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual basis. Once services have been pre-approved, Somekh Chaikin and our management then report to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis regarding the extent of services actually provided in accordance with the applicable pre-approval, and regarding the fees for the services performed.
Our Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and non-audit services provided to us and to our subsidiaries during the periods listed below. The Audit Committee approves discrete projects on a case-by-case basis that may have a material effect on our operations and also considers whether proposed services are compatible with the independence of the independent auditors.
Pursuant to our pre-approval policy, the Audit Committee pre-approves and delegates to our Chairman of the Board the authority to approve the retention of ad-hoc audit and non-audit services from our independent auditors, beyond the scope approved by the Audit Committee as part of the annual audit plan.
Principal Accountant Fees and Services
