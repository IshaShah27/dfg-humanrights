CORPORATE CAPITAL TRUST II

2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

PROXY STATEMENT 
GENERAL 
Corporate Capital Trust II (the "Company") has made these proxy materials available to you on the Internet or has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of trustees of the Company for use at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday, December 13, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and any postponements or adjournments thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). The Annual Meeting will be held at the offices of FS Investments located at 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19112. You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement"). 
The Company's proxy materials for the Annual Meeting, including, this Proxy Statement, the Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Notice of Annual Meeting"), and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 3, 2018 (the "Annual Report"), were first sent or made available to shareholders on or about October 26, 2018. 
Items of Business 
All properly executed proxies representing shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, which we refer to as the "Shares," received prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the day before the Annual Meeting, or the "cut-off time," will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. If no specification is made, the Shares will be voted FOR: 
(i) the proposal to re-elect Todd C. Builione for a one year term expiring at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified; 
(ii) the proposal to re-elect James H. Kropp for a one year term expiring at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified; 
(iii) the proposal to re-elect Mark D. Linsz for a one year term expiring at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified; 
(iv) the proposal to re-elect Thomas W. Morgan for a one year term expiring at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified; 
(v) the proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 (which we refer to as the "Accountant Proposal"). 
Record Date 
Only shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 17, 2018, which we refer to as the "Record Date," are entitled to notice of, to attend and to vote at, the Annual Meeting and any postponements or adjournments thereof. As of the Record Date, there were 12,442,996 issued and outstanding Shares held by 2,508 holders of record.  Proxy and Voting Procedures 
Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each Share held, and may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy in accordance with the instructions provided below. 
Your vote is important. By authorizing a proxy promptly, the expense of a second mailing and/or additional solicitations by other means, including, in person and by telephone, facsimile, and email may be avoided. 
Voting by Shareholders of Record 
If your Shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, DST Systems, Inc., you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those Shares, and the Notice of Annual Meeting and other proxy materials were furnished directly to you by the Company. If you are a shareholder of record, there are four ways to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting by requesting a ballot when you arrive. You must  bring valid picture identification such as a driver's license or passport and may be requested to provide proof of Share ownership as of the Record Date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet. You may vote by proxy via the Internet by visiting www.proxyvote.com and entering  the control number found on the proxy card. After inputting the control number, you may direct your proxy how to vote on each proposal. You will have an opportunity to review your directions and make any necessary changes before submitting your  directions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone. If you receive or request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a  proxy card; and you may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number and entering the control number located on the proxy card. After inputting the control number, you may direct your proxy how to vote on each proposal. You will have an opportunity  to review your directions and make any necessary changes before submitting your directions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. If you receive or request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a proxy  card; and you may vote by proxy by filling out the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the envelope provided. Allow sufficient time for your proxy card to be timely received prior to the cut-off time.   
[END TABLE]
Voting by Beneficial Owners of Shares 
If your Shares are held by a broker or other custodian, the proxy materials were furnished to the broker or other custodian that holds your Shares. If you are the beneficial owner of Shares, there are four ways you can vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. If you are the beneficial owner of Shares held by a broker or other custodian and you wish to  vote your Shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker or other custodian that holds your Shares. A legal proxy is a written document that will authorize you to vote your Shares held by a broker  or other custodian at the Annual Meeting. Please contact the broker or other custodian that holds your Shares for instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy.  
[END TABLE]
You must bring a copy of the legal proxy to the Annual Meeting and request a ballot when you arrive. You must also bring valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. In order for your votes to be counted, you must hand both the copy of the legal proxy and your completed ballot to a Company representative to be provided to the inspector of election. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet. You may vote by proxy via the Internet by visiting www.proxyvote.com and entering  the control number found on the voting instruction form. The availability of Internet voting may depend on the voting process of the broker or other custodian that holds your Shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting  instruction form; and you may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number and entering the control number found on the voting instruction form. The availability of telephone voting may depend on the voting process of the organization that holds  your Shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting  instruction form; and you may vote by proxy by filling out the voting instruction form and returning it in the envelope provided. Please allow sufficient time for the proxy card to be timely received prior to the  cut-off time.  
[END TABLE]
To request a printed set of the proxy materials, beneficial owners of Shares should send a written request to the organization that holds their Shares. 
Shares represented by valid proxies at the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the directions given. If the enclosed proxy card is signed and returned without any directions given, the shares will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees for director named in this proxy statement and for the other proposals described in this proxy statement. 
The Board does not intend to present, and has no information indicating that others will present, any business at the Annual Meeting, other than as set forth in this Proxy Statement. However, if other matters requiring the vote of our stockholders come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the proxies held by them in their discretion. 
Quorum; Adjournments 
At least fifty percent of the Shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present at the Annual Meeting to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Your Shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum, if you: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Are entitled to vote and you are present in person at the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Have properly voted by proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by mail.  
[END TABLE]
Shares for which brokers have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Shares and do not have, or choose not to exercise, discretionary authority to vote the Shares on certain proposals (which are considered "broker non-votes" with respect to such proposals) will also be treated as Shares present for quorum purposes. If a quorum is not present, the Company may adjourn the Annual Meeting to a date not more than 120 days after the Record Date without further notice, other than announcement at the Annual Meeting, to solicit additional proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies "FOR" such adjournment. Any business that might have been transacted at the Annual Meeting as originally noticed may be transacted at any adjourned meeting(s) at which a quorum is present. 
Vote Required; Broker Non-Votes; Effect of Abstentions 
Approval of Director Election Proposals. Each director nominee will be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, provided that a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the election of Messrs. Builione, Kropp, Linsz and Morgan. 
Approval of Accountant Proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, provided that a quorum is present, is necessary for approval of the Accountant Proposal. Abstentions will not count as votes cast and will therefore have no effect on the Accountant Proposal. Because brokers will   have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Shares, there will not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Accountant Proposal.
Shareholders of Record 
If you are a shareholder of record, your properly executed proxy received prior to the Annual Meeting, and not duly revoked, will be voted in accordance with your instructions marked thereon. However, if you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your Shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. With respect to any other business that may be properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote your Shares in such manner as they may determine in their discretion. 
Beneficial Owners of Shares 
If you are a beneficial owner of Shares held by a broker or other custodian, you may instruct the broker or other custodian that holds your Shares as to how to vote your Shares via the voting instruction form included with this proxy statement. All voting instruction forms timely received by the broker or other custodian that holds your Shares, and not duly revoked, will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. However, if you do not provide your broker or other custodian of your Shares with specific voting instructions, then your Shares are referred to as "uninstructed shares;" and whether your broker or other custodian has the discretion to vote such uninstructed shares on your behalf depends on the ballot item. Generally, the organization that holds your Shares may vote them in its discretion on "routine" matters, such as the Accountant Proposal. However, the broker or other custodian cannot vote uninstructed shares on "non-routine" matters, and will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on such matters with respect to your Shares. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Brokers and other custodians cannot vote uninstructed shares on your behalf on any of the proposals at the Annual Meeting other than the Accountant Proposal. For your vote to be counted on any other proposal, you must submit your voting instruction form to your broker or other custodian. 
Revocation of Proxies 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote before the proxies are voted at the Annual Meeting. You may change your vote using the Internet or telephone methods described herein, prior to the applicable cutoff time before the Annual Meeting, in which case only your latest Internet or telephone proxy will be counted. Alternatively, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote by signing and returning a new proxy dated as of a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy, unless you properly vote at the Annual Meeting, or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation to the Company prior to the Annual Meeting at the following address: Corporate Capital Trust II, 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19112, Attention: Stephen S. Sypherd, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. 
Information Regarding this Solicitation 
The Company is paying all costs associated with the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting. The Company has retained Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc., which we refer to as "Broadridge," to assist in the solicitation of proxies at a cost that the Company anticipates will not exceed $2,900 plus the reimbursement of Broadridge's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
In addition, the Company must pay brokers or other custodians representing beneficial owners of Shares certain fees associated with forwarding the printed proxy materials by mail to beneficial owners who specifically request them, and obtaining beneficial owners' voting instructions. The Company will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses in so doing.  In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by other means, including, in person and by telephone, facsimile, and email, by Broadridge and/or by trustees, officers and employees of the Company, FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, the Company's investment advisor (the "Advisor") and/or affiliates of FS Investments and KKR Credit Advisors (US), LLC ("KKR"), none of whom will receive any additional compensation for their services. 
Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials 
In accordance with SEC regulations, the Company has made this Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting and the Annual Report available to Shareholders on the Internet. Shareholders may (i) access and review the Company's proxy materials, (ii) authorize their proxies, as described in "Proxy and Voting Procedures," below, and/or (iii) elect to receive future proxy materials by electronic delivery, via the Internet address provided below. 
This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting and the Company's Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
Electronic Delivery of Proxy Materials 
Pursuant to the rules adopted by the SEC, the Company furnishes proxy materials by email to those shareholders who have elected to receive their proxy materials electronically. While the Company encourages shareholders to take advantage of electronic delivery of proxy materials, which helps to reduce the environmental impact of annual meetings and the cost associated with the physical printing and mailing of materials, shareholders who have elected to receive proxy materials electronically by email, as well as beneficial owners of Shares held by a broker or custodian, may request a printed set of proxy materials. Instructions on how to request a printed set of the proxy materials are provided in the section entitled "Proxy and Voting Procedures." 
Where to Obtain More Information 
The Company makes available free of charge on its website, www.fsinvestments.com/investments/funds/corporate-capital-trust-ii, its Annual Report as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files the Annual Report with the SEC. A copy of the Company's Annual Report will be furnished shareholders, without exhibits, at no charge, upon written request to the Company at its principal executive offices: 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19112, Attention: Stephen S. Sypherd, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Upon payment of a reasonable fee, shareholders may also obtain a copy of the exhibits to the Company's Annual Report.  TRUSTEES, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Information about the Board, Trustee Nominees and Executive Officers 
Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), the number of trustees on the Board may not be fewer than the minimum number required by applicable law. Each trustee is elected annually for a term of one year, and serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Our Nominating & Governance Committee has nominated four trustees, Mr. Todd C. Builione, Mr. James H. Kropp, Mr. Mark D. Linsz, and Mr. Thomas W. Morgan, and certain information with respect to these trustees is set forth below, including their names, ages, a brief description of their recent business experience, including present occupations and employment, certain trusteeships that each person holds, and the year in which each person became a trustee of the Company. 
The role of the Board is to provide general oversight of the Company's business affairs and to exercise all of the Company's powers except those reserved for the shareholders. The responsibilities of the Board also include, among other things, the oversight of the Company's investment activities, the quarterly valuation of the Company's assets, oversight of the Company's financing arrangements and corporate governance activities. 
The Board is currently composed of four trustees, three of whom are not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of the Company or the Advisor. These individuals are referred to as the "Independent Trustees." Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act defines an "interested person" to include, among other things, any person who has, or within the last two years has had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company. The members of the Board that are not Independent Trustees are referred to as the "Interested Trustees." 
The Board has determined that Mr. Kropp, Mr. Linsz and Mr. Morgan are Independent Trustees. Based upon information requested from each trustee concerning his background, employment and affiliations, the Board has affirmatively determined that none of the Independent Trustees has, or within the last two years has had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company or the Advisor.
In considering each trustee and the composition of the Board as a whole, the Board utilizes a diverse group of experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills that the Board believes enables a trustee to make a significant contribution to the Board, the Company and its shareholders. These experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills, which are more fully described below, include, but are not limited to, management experience, independence, financial expertise and experience serving as a director or trustee of other entities. The Board may also consider such other experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills as it deems appropriate, given the then-current needs of the Board and the Company. Although the Board does not have any formal policy regarding the amount of diversity needed on the Board, diversity is one of the factors considered by the Board in assessing the composition of the Board. 
Interested Trustees 
Todd C. Builione has served as a director since March 2017. He also serves as the Company's President and the president and member of the board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, of FS Investment Corporation, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, FS Investment Corporation IV and Corporate Capital Trust, Inc. (including the Company, the "Fund Complex"). Mr. Builione joined KKR in 2013 and is a Member of KKR and President of KKR Credit & Capital Markets. Mr. Builione also serves on the KKR Global Risk Committee. Prior to joining KKR, Mr. Builione served as President of Highbridge Capital Management, CEO of Highbridge's Hedge Fund business and a member of the Investment and Risk Committees.

Mr. Builione was selected as one of the Company's two Interested Trustees because of his prior experience and familiarity with the markets we primarily target to invest in. Equally significant is his knowledge and prior experience in the management of large businesses in the areas we operate in, and portfolio risk management and analytics, both of which we believe are key qualifications for providing sound direction and leadership.

 Risk Oversight and Board Structure 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Company's business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. Among other things, the Board sets broad policies for the Company and approves the appointment of the Company's investment advisors, administrator and officers. The role of the Board, and of any individual trustee, is one of oversight and not of management of the Company's day-to-day affairs. 
Under the Company's Bylaws, the Board may designate one of the Company's trustees as chair to preside over meetings of the Board and meetings of shareholders, and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the Board. The Company believes that the Board's flexibility to determine its chair and reorganize its leadership from time to time is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Presently, Mr. Builione serves as chairman of the Board and is an "interested person" by virtue of being the Company's chief executive officer and his employment with KKR. The Company believes that this creates a firm link between management and the Board and provides unified leadership for carrying out the Company's strategic initiatives and business plans. The Board has determined that the compositions of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and the Independent Trustee Committee are appropriate means to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from the chair's status as an interested person of the Company. The Board, which reviews its leadership structure periodically as part of its annual self-assessment process, further believes that its structure is presently appropriate to enable it to exercise its oversight of the Company. 
All of the Independent Trustees play an active role on the Board. The Independent Trustees compose a majority of the Board and will be closely involved in all material deliberations related to the Company. The Board believes that, with these practices, each Independent Trustee has an equal involvement in the actions and oversight role of the Board and equal accountability to the Company and its shareholders. The Independent Trustees are expected to meet separately (i) as part of each regular Board meeting, and (ii) with the Company's chief compliance officer, as part of at least one Board meeting each year. The Independent Trustee Committee may hold additional meetings at the request of any Independent Trustee. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees the Company's business and operations, including certain risk management functions. Risk management is a broad concept comprising many disparate elements (for example, investment risk, issuer and counterparty risk, compliance risk, operational risk, and business continuity risk). The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through its committees. In the course of providing oversight, the Board and its committees receive reports on the Company's and the Advisor's activities, including reports regarding the Company's investment portfolio and financial accounting and reporting. The Board also receives a quarterly report from the Company's chief compliance officer, who reports on the Company's compliance with the federal and state securities laws and the Company's internal compliance policies and procedures as well as those of the Advisor, the Company's administrator and the Company's transfer agent. The Audit Committee's meetings with the Company's independent public accounting firm also contribute to its oversight of certain internal control risks. In addition, the Board meets periodically with the Advisor to receive reports regarding the Company's operations, including reports on certain investment and operational risks, and the Independent Trustees are encouraged to communicate directly with senior members of the Company's management. 
The Board believes that its role in risk oversight is appropriate. The Company believes that there are robust internal processes in place and a strong internal control environment to identify and manage risks. However, not all risks that may affect the Company can be identified or processes and controls developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects, and some risks are beyond the control of the Company, the Advisor and the Company's other service providers.  On March 16, 2017, Mr. Erik Falk, in connection with his retirement from KKR & Co., resigned from the Board, and the Board appointed Mr. Builione effective as of Mr. Falk's resignation. On December 6, 2017, Mr. Thomas Sittema resigned from the Board and his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On December 7, 2017, the Board appointed Mr. Chirag J. Bhavsar, then Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Sittema's resignation. On April 5, 2018, in connection with the transition of advisory services to the Advisor, Mr. Bhavsar resigned from the Board. The Board met five times during the fiscal year ended 2017 at regularly scheduled meetings. Each trustee attended all meetings of the Board held during 2017 to which they were invited, with the exception of Mr. Sittema and Mr. Builione who each missed one meeting.

Committees of the Board 
In addition to serving on the Board, the Company's trustees also serve on one or more of the following committees that have been established by the Board to handle certain designated responsibilities. The Board has designated a chairman of each committee.

The Company's Nominating and Governance Committee will consider shareholders' proposed nominations for trustees. A shareholder who desires to recommend a nominee must submit a request in writing pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Company's Bylaws. The Company's Nominating and Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended in writing by a shareholder (other than shareholder recommendations of himself or herself) to serve as trustees, provided that: (i) such person is a shareholder of the Company at the time he, she or it recommends such nominee and is entitled to vote at the meeting of shareholders at which trustees will be elected; and (ii) the Company's Nominating and Governance Committee will make the final determination as to the qualifications of the individual to be nominated.

The Advisor also provides administrative services to the Company under the Administrative Services Agreement. In connection with its services, the Advisor has agreed to provide the Company with personnel to serve as the Company's appointed officers. The Company's appointed officers (who, while associated with the Advisor, serve on behalf of the Company) consist of the Company's chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, chief investment officer, , secretary, treasurer, general counsel, chief compliance officer, , and vice president of investments. The Company does not pay any compensation to any of the Company's officers.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Company is subject to certain regulatory requirements that restrict the Company's ability to engage in certain related-party transactions. The Company has policies and procedures in place for the review, approval and monitoring of transactions involving the Company and certain persons related to it, to ensure that it does not enter into any prohibited transactions. For example, the Company's Bylaws provide that, among other things, the Company may not engage in certain transactions with the Advisor or a trustee of the Company or an affiliate thereof unless (a) such transaction complies with all applicable law and (b) a majority of the Company's trustees (including a majority of the Independent Trustees) not otherwise interested in such transaction approve such transaction as fair and reasonable to the Company and on terms and conditions not less favorable to the Company than those available from non-affiliated third parties. In addition, the Independent Trustee Committee evaluates transactions between the Company and its affiliates that are subject to restrictions under Section 57 of the 1940 Act.
Investment Advisory Services 
On April 9, 2018, the Company terminated the Former Investment Advisory Agreement (as defined below) and concurrently entered into a new investment advisory agreement with the Advisor (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Advisor a fee for its services consisting of two components – a base management fee based on the average value of the Company's gross assets and incentive fees based on the Company's performance. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 1.50% of the average value of the Company's gross assets, as compared to the annual rate of 2.00% under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, the calculation of the base management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement excludes cash and cash equivalents from gross assets, as compared to the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, which included cash and cash equivalents within the definition of gross assets. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the serves as the sole investment adviser of the Company. 
Previously, the Company was a party to an investment advisory agreement (the "Former Investment Advisory Agreement") with CNL Fund Advisors II, LLC ("CNL") for the overall management of the Company's activities. CNL was a party to a sub-advisory agreement with KKR (the "Former Sub-Advisory Agreement"), under which KKR was responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company's investment portfolio. Pursuant to the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, CNL earned (i) a management fee equal to an annual rate of 2.00% of the Company's average gross assets, and (ii) an incentive fee based on the Company's performance. The incentive fee consisted of (i) a subordinated incentive fee on income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. CNL compensated KKR for advisory services that it provided to the Company with 50% of the fees that CNL received under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement. 
A subordinated incentive fee on income is payable to the Advisor each calendar quarter if the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment fee income (as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement and approved by the Company's board of trustees) exceeds the 1.75% quarterly preference return to the Company's shareholders (the ratio of pre-incentive fee net investment income divided by average adjusted capital). 
The annual incentive fees on capital gains recorded for GAAP purposes are equal to (i) 20% of the Company's realized and unrealized capital gains on a cumulative basis since inception, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception, less (ii) the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on capital gains. For financial reporting purposes, in accordance with GAAP, the Company includes unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio in the calculation of incentive fees on capital gains; however, such amounts are not payable by the Company unless and until the net unrealized appreciation is actually realized. The actual amount of incentive fees on capital gains that are due and payable to the Advisor is determined at the end of the calendar year.  The terms of the incentive fees are substantially the same as those to which CNL was entitled to receive under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement. 
The Company did not incur any subordinated incentive fee on income under the Investment Advisory Agreements during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company had accrued $15,000 of incentive fees payable on capital gains under the Investment Advisory Agreements as of June 30, 2018. 
Administrative Services Agreements 
Pursuant to the administrative services agreement dated April 9, 2018 (the "Administrative Services Agreement"), the Advisor oversees the Company's day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities and other administrative services. The Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. Pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, the Company reimburses the Advisor no less than monthly for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) the Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. The Advisor allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics consistent with past practice (but solely to the extent such past practice is not inconsistent with the policies of the Advisor). The Company does not reimburse the Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of the Advisor. 
The Company was previously party to an administrative services agreement with CNL (the "Former Administrative Services Agreement"), which terminated effective April 9, 2018, the terms of which were substantially the same as the Administrative Service Agreement with the Advisor. The administrative service fees paid pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement and the Former Administrative Services Agreement during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are set forth in the table below. 
Managing Dealer Fees and Expenses 
The managing dealer for the Company's continuous public offering was CNL Securities Corp. (the "Managing Dealer"), which is an affiliate of CNL. Prior to the closing of the Company's continuous public offering, the Managing Dealer was entitled to receive an upfront sales load of 4.75% of the gross offering proceeds of shares sold of Shares sold in the offering pursuant to an Amended and Restated Managing Dealer Agreement that became effective on April 28, 2017 (the "Managing Dealer Agreement"). Additionally, the Managing Dealer received an annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee of the net asset value with respect to shares sold in the offering. The ongoing distribution and shareholder servicing fee were paid by the Company to the Managing Dealer pursuant to a distribution plan (the "Distribution Plan") adopted by the Company in compliance with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the 1940 Act, as if those rules applied to the Company. Among other requirements, such plan must be approved annually by a vote of the Company's board of trustees including the trustees who are not "interested persons" as defined in the 1940 Act and have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of such plan or in any agreements related to such plan. The Managing Dealer engaged unrelated, third-party participating broker-dealers in connection with the Offerings and, in connection therewith, re-allows all or a portion of such fees to participating broker-dealers. The Managing Dealer Agreement and Distribution Plan were terminated effective April 30, 2018, in connection with the closing of the Company's continuous public offering and the transition of advisory services to the Advisor.  Organization and Offering Costs 
Historically, under the terms of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, CNL (and indirectly KKR) was entitled to receive up to 1.5% of gross offering proceeds as reimbursement for organization and offering expenses incurred on behalf of the Company. CNL and its affiliates have incurred organization and offering costs of approximately $5.4 million as of March 31, 2018. CNL waived the reimbursement of organization and offering expenses in connection with the Company's gross capital raise from the Offering from March 1, 2016 (the period beginning at the time the Company satisfied the minimum offering requirement) through June 30, 2017 (the "O&O Reimbursement Waiver"). The O&O Reimbursement Waiver did not reduce the amount of organization and offering expenses incurred by CNL and KKR that were eligible for reimbursement in future periods based on subsequent gross capital raised by the Company after April 30, 2017. Gross capital raised by the Company after April 30, 2017 was subject to the maximum organization and offering cost reimbursement of 1.50%. CNL and KKR were entitled to reimbursement of approximately $400,000 of organization and offering costs for gross capital raised for the period May 1, 2017 through April 9, 2018, all of which had been reimbursed to the Former Advisors as of April 9, 2018. A contingent obligation for the balance of organization and offering costs, subject to reimbursement based on future gross proceeds raised assuming a reinstatement of the Company's Offering, was approximately $5.0 million as of April 30, 2018. 
On April 30, 2018, the Company terminated its Offering and in conjunction therewith, the Former Advisors agreed to permanently waive their rights to receive reimbursement of approximately $5.0 million of organization and offering expenses that they had incurred on the Company's behalf. As such, as of June 30, 2018, the Company had no contingent obligations to reimburse its Former Advisors for organization and offering expenses. 
Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreements 
The Company was party to an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement, as amended (the "Former Expense Support Agreement") with the Advisor pursuant to which CNL and KKR (together, the "Former Advisors") jointly and severally agreed to pay to the Company some or all operating expenses (an "Expense Support Payment") for each month during the Expense Support Payment Period (as defined below) in which the Company's board of trustees declares a distribution to its shareholders. The "Expense Support Payment Period" commenced on March 1, 2016 and terminated effective with the termination of the Former Expense Support Agreement on April 9, 2018. 
The Former Advisors were entitled to be reimbursed promptly by the Company (a "Reimbursement Payment") for Expense Support Payments made with respect to any class of common shares, subject to the limitation that no Reimbursement Payment may be made by the Company to the extent that it would cause the Company's other operating expenses (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) for such class of common shares to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of average net assets attributable to shares of such class of common shares and (B) the percentage of our average net assets attributable to shares of such class of common shares represented by other operating expenses (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from the Advisor was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support payment from the Advisor made during the same fiscal year). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Expense Support Agreement, no Reimbursement Payment will be made with respect to any class of common shares if the effective rate of distributions per share on such class of common shares declared by the Company at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the effective rate of distributions per share on such class of common shares at the time the Expense Support Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. For this purpose, "effective rate of distributions per share" means actual declared distribution rate per share exclusive of return of capital, if any. The Company's obligation to reimburse each Expense Support Payment will terminate three years from the date on which such Expense Support Payment was made or waived.  Concurrently with the Company's entry into the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement, on April 9, 2018, the Company entered into a new expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the "Expense Support Agreement"), which replaced the Former Expense Support Agreement. The Expense Support Agreement is substantially similar to the Former Expense Support Agreement.

Indemnification 
The Investment Advisory Agreement provides certain indemnification to the Advisors, their trustees, officers, persons associated with the Advisor, and their affiliates. The Former Investment Advisory Agreement and the Former Sub-Advisory Agreement, each of which were terminated on April 9, 2018, provided certain indemnification to the Former Advisors, their trustees, officers, persons associated with the Former Advisors, and their affiliates The managing dealer agreement, which was terminated on April 5, 2018, provided certain indemnification to the Managing Dealer and each participating broker and their respective officers, trustees, partners, employees, associated persons, agents and control persons. In addition, the Company's Declaration of Trust provide certain indemnifications to its officers, trustees, agents, and certain other persons. As of December 31, 2017, management believed that the risk of incurring of any losses for such indemnification was remote. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and trustees, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Officers, trustees and greater than ten percent shareholders also are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely upon a review of the copies of such statements furnished to the Company, and on written representations from the reporting persons, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the Company's trustees and officers were timely met during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

Proposal No. 2 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee have re-appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP, 555 Mission Street, San Francisco, California 94105, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and as auditors of the Company's consolidated financial statements for 2018. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2015. 
At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018. The Company is not required to have the shareholders ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, however, the Company is doing so because it believes it is a matter of best corporate   practices. In the event of a negative vote on such ratification, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year, if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present in person at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to questions.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Company maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things, mandates that the Audit Committee review, negotiate and approve in advance the scope of work, any related engagement letter and the fees to be charged by the independent registered public accounting firm for audit services and permissible non-audit services for the Company, and for permissible non-audit services for the Company's investment advisors and any affiliates thereof that provide services to the Company, if such non-audit services have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting of the Company. All of the audit and non-audit services described above for which fees were incurred by the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with its pre-approval policy. 
Audit Committee Report 
As part of its oversight of the Company's financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with both management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the Company's financial statements filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Management advised the Audit Committee that all financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and reviewed significant accounting issues with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
The Audit Committee has pre-approved, in accordance with its pre-approval policy, the permitted audit, audit-related, tax, and other services to be provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the firm's independence.  Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval in accordance with its pre-approval policy, irrespective of the amount, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the Audit Committee Chair, James H. Kropp, who will report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP to management. 
The Audit Committee received and reviewed the written disclosures from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rule regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with audit committees concerning independence, and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed the audit fees paid by the Company to Deloitte & Touche LLP. It has also reviewed non-audit services and fees to assure compliance with the Company's and the Audit Committee's policies restricting Deloitte & Touche LLP from performing services that might impair its independence. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for 2016, for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also recommended the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.
