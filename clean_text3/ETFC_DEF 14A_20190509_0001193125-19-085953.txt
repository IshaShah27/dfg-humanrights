Stockholders Should Read the Entire Proxy Statement Carefully Prior to Returning Their Proxy Cards 
PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OF E*TRADE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
To Be Held May 9, 2019 
This proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") which will be held at The Westin New York at Times Square, 270 West 43rd Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10036, on May 9, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. EDT, or at any adjournments or postponements thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These materials were first sent or made available to stockholders on or about March 26, 2019. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
We have made these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, have delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the Board's solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting to be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. EDT, and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will act upon the matters outlined in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  the election of directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of the  Company's Named Executive Officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public  accounting firm.  
[END TABLE]
Once the business of the Annual Meeting is concluded, representatives from the Company and Deloitte & Touche LLP will be available to respond to questions from stockholders. 
What is a proxy and how does it work? 
The Board is asking for your proxy. A "proxy" is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own in the manner you direct. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or proxy card. By giving your proxy to the persons named as proxy holders in the proxy card accompanying this Proxy Statement, you authorize them to vote your shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. You may vote your shares for, against or abstain for all, some or none of the director nominees and you may choose to vote your shares for, against or abstain with respect to the other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. 
If you complete and submit your proxy in one of the manners described below, but do not specify how to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares FOR the election of directors as described in "Proposal 1—Election of Directors"; FOR the approval of the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") as described in "Proposal 2—Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote")"; and FOR the ratification of the appointment of accountants as described in "Proposal 3—Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm." 
How can I receive a paper or electronic copy of this Proxy Statement? 
We mailed the Notice of Internet Availability to our stockholders, except those who had previously requested paper materials. The Notice of Internet Availability contains instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (the   "2018 Annual Report"), on the Internet. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice of Internet Availability. 
Who may vote and how many votes do I have? 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019 (the "Record Date") may vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, there were 245,136,653 outstanding shares of our Common Stock. 
All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders of record on the Record Date will have one vote for each share of Common Stock they hold. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of stock held in street name? 
Stockholders of Record. If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are a "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares and the Notice of Internet Availability or the proxy materials were sent directly to you by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 
Street Name Holders. If you hold your shares in an account at a bank or broker, you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." The Notice of Internet Availability or proxy materials were forwarded to you by your bank or broker, who is the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank or broker on how to vote the shares held in your account. See the voting instruction form provided by your bank or broker for instructions. 
How can I vote my shares? 
By Written Proxy. All stockholders of record who received a Notice of Internet Availability or the proxy materials electronically may request a proxy card at any time by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability or on the voting website at www.proxyvote.com. If you are a street name holder, you will receive instructions on how you may vote from your bank or broker, unless you previously enrolled in electronic delivery. 
By Telephone or Internet. All stockholders of record may vote by telephone using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card, or on the Internet by visiting www.proxyvote.com before 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 8, 2019. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. If you would like to receive future stockholder materials electronically, please enroll after you complete your voting process on www.proxyvote.com. Street name holders may vote by Internet or telephone if their bank or broker makes those methods available, in which case the bank or broker will provide instructions with the proxy materials. 
In Person. All stockholders of record may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Street name holders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described below. 
Whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting or not, we encourage you to vote by proxy as soon as possible. Please note that the Notice of Internet Availability is not a proxy card and it cannot be used to vote your shares. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or Voting Instruction Form? 
You may receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or voting instruction form depending on how you hold your shares. You will receive a Notice of Internet Availability for shares registered in your name, unless you previously requested paper materials. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may receive a voting instruction form from your bank or broker asking how you want to vote. If your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account, you will receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or voting instruction form. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, please vote each account on the Internet or by telephone, or sign and return by mail all proxy cards and voting instruction forms. We encourage you to vote all of your shares. 
Can I change my vote? 
Stockholders of record may revoke a proxy and/or change their vote before the time of voting at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting again at www.proxyvote.com or by telephone before 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 8, 2019,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• mailing a revised proxy card dated later than the prior proxy, or

To be counted, revocations submitted in a manner provided for above must be received no later than the day before the Annual Meeting. You may also revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• contacting your bank or broker to request a legal proxy in order to vote your shares in person at the Annual  Meeting.

Who can attend the Annual Meeting? 
Only stockholders or their duly appointed proxies, and guests of the Company may attend the Annual Meeting. 
Stockholders of Record. Please bring photo identification and proof of share ownership with you to the Annual Meeting. For example, the Notice of Internet Availability received in connection with this meeting is acceptable proof of share ownership. 
Street Name Holders. Please bring photo identification and proof of share ownership with you to enter the Annual Meeting. For example, a bank or brokerage account statement showing that you owned Common Stock in the Company on the Record Date is acceptable as proof of share ownership. You may not, however, vote your shares at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your bank or broker. A legal proxy is a bank's or broker's authorization for you to vote the shares it holds in its name on your behalf. To obtain a legal proxy, please contact your bank or broker for further information. 
What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting? 
A quorum is necessary to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. A quorum requires the presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote, in person or represented by proxy. Your shares will be counted toward the quorum requirement if you have voted by proxy. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes count as "shares present" at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee who holds shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular item because the nominee does not have discretionary voting authority to vote on that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. 
If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained. 
How many votes are needed to approve each of the proposals and what are the effects of such votes? 
For "Proposal 1—Election of Directors," directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes (described above) will have no impact, as they are not counted as votes cast. In an uncontested election, such as this year's election, any director nominee currently serving as a director who receives an equal or greater number of votes "against" as compared to votes "for" must tender his or her resignation to the Governance Committee of the Board. The Governance Committee is required to make recommendations to the Board with respect to any such tendered resignation. The Board will act on the tendered resignation within 90 days from the certification of the stockholder vote and will publicly disclose its decision, including its rationale. Please see "Majority Voting Standard and Director Resignation Policy" on page 12 for further details. 
For "Proposal 2—Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote")," the outcome of the vote will not be binding on the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee, in the exercise of their fiduciary duties, will consider the outcome of the advisory vote in determining future compensation decisions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast will be considered approval by our stockholders of the compensation of our NEOs. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no impact, as they are not counted as votes cast, on Proposal 2. 
For "Proposal 3— Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm," an affirmative vote of the majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the item will be considered ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal 3.  If you are a street name holder and you do not instruct the bank or broker on how to vote your shares, your bank or broker may exercise its discretionary authority to vote your shares with regard to Proposal 3, but cannot exercise its discretionary authority to vote your shares regarding Proposals 1 and 2, thus resulting in "broker non-votes." 
Who pays for the solicitation of proxies? 
The Company pays the cost of soliciting proxies. We retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to advise the Company and assist with our solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $17,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for sending soliciting materials to beneficial owners and obtaining their votes. 
In addition, our employees, without additional compensation, may assist with our solicitation of proxies either personally or by mail, telephone or electronic media. 
What if only one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy materials was delivered to multiple stockholders who share a single address? 
Under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules, a single Notice of Internet Availability (or one copy of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying 2018 Annual Report, for those stockholders who previously requested paper copies) will be delivered in one envelope to multiple stockholders having the same last name and address and to individuals with more than one account registered at American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC with the same address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. This procedure, referred to as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate materials that stockholders receive and reduces mailing expenses. 
You may revoke your consent to future householding mailings or enroll in householding by submitting a written request to our Corporate Secretary at the Company's offices located at Ballston Tower, 671 North Glebe Road, 15th Floor, Arlington, VA 22203-2120. You may also send an email to ir@etrade.com or call us at (646) 521-4340. 
We will promptly deliver, upon verbal or written request, a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability and other proxy materials to any stockholder residing at an address to which only a single copy of the documents was originally delivered. Requests for additional copies should be directed to our Corporate Secretary as described above.  PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Listed below are the Company's twelve nominees standing for election at this Annual Meeting, each of whom has been nominated by the Board for election by the stockholders and has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. Under the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each of the twelve nominees would, if elected, serve for a term beginning on the date of election and ending at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. 
In the absence of contrary instructions, the proxy holders intend to vote all proxies received by them FOR the nominees for director listed below. Although we know of no reason why any of the nominees would not be able to serve, if any nominee is unavailable for election, the proxy holders intend to vote your Common Stock for any substitute nominee proposed by the Board. 
Qualifications of Directors 
The Board, acting through its Governance Committee, is responsible for recommending to the stockholders a group of nominees that, taken together, have a significant breadth and diversity of relevant experience, professional expertise, knowledge and abilities to carry out the Board's responsibilities. Our Governance Committee Charter requires the Governance Committee to periodically review the composition of the Board and its committees in light of the risks, current challenges and needs of the Company and determine whether to add or remove individuals after considering issues of knowledge, expertise, judgment, term of service, age, skills, diversity of background and experience and relationships with various constituencies. 
In presenting this year's nominees, the Governance Committee considered, among other things, the experience the directors standing for re-election gained in enhancing their oversight over management in light of the heightened standards from the Company's and its subsidiaries' regulators, their ability to work as a collegial group during a period of increased competitive pressures and the nominees' willingness to spend the time necessary to perform their duties despite other professional commitments. 
In addition to the characteristics common to all of our nominees, which include expertise within the financial services industry, integrity, a strong professional reputation and a record of achievement in senior executive capacities, the Governance Committee has recommended for inclusion on the Board persons with diverse backgrounds and skills reflecting the needs of the Company. 
In evaluating each nominee for service on the Board, the Governance Committee considered the following specific experience and skills of the nominees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience in a broad range of occupations and industries, which provides a diversity of viewpoints and expertise  relating to execution of the Company's business plans, including the banking, brokerage and financial services industry which is common to all our nominees, technology and digital media (Messrs.

During 2018 the Board maintained two advisory working groups, the Growth Initiative Advisory Working Group and the Integration Advisory Working Group, which provided advice and counsel to management on their respective topic. 
Each of these committees is composed entirely of directors that meet the applicable independence requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"). Additionally, each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence requirements for audit committee members set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), and each member of the Compensation Committee qualifies as a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and as an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
The charters of each of these committees are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at about.etrade.com in the sub-section titled "Corporate Governance." You may also request a copy of each of these documents free of charge by writing to E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Ballston Tower, 671 North Glebe Road, 15th Floor, Arlington, VA 22203-2120, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

Risk Management 
The Board plays an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risks. The Board regularly reviews reports from members of senior management and committees on areas of material risk to the Company, including credit, liquidity, market, operational, strategic, reputational, information technology, including cybersecurity, data, legal, and regulatory and compliance risks. In particular, the Risk Oversight Committee assists the Board   and senior management, including the Company's Chief Risk Officer, the Company's General Counsel, the Company's Chief Compliance Officer and the Company's Chief Information Security Officer (the "CISO"), in the effective identification, assessment and management of the Company's risks and in working to manage and monitor the financial risk and return of the Company. The Risk Oversight Committee oversees and reviews with senior management the capital planning processes, the Company's capital position and capital adequacy, and consolidated capital reporting. The Risk Oversight Committee also oversees, reviews and challenges senior management and, when applicable, recommends to the Board for its approval policies related to the financial and risk management of the Company and its subsidiaries and oversees the Company's implementation of such policies. These include policies relating to capital, funding, liquidity and funds transfer, asset and liability management and cash management, and policies for assessing and managing exposure of the Company's operational risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk, information technology risk, including cybersecurity risk, data risk, strategic risk, legal risk, and regulatory and compliance risk. Additionally, the Risk Oversight Committee reviews the Company's business continuity plan, strategic plan, strategic transactions, and proposed investments, and assists in defining the Company's Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement. The Risk Oversight Committee makes recommendations regarding the Company's Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement to the Board for its approval considering with senior management the Company's risk capacity, risk appetite, global risk limits, current risk profile, remediation protocols and risk exceptions. 
On a quarterly basis, the CISO updates the Risk Oversight Committee on Information Security and Cybersecurity developments. On an annual basis, the Risk Oversight Committee reviews and approves the Company's Information Security Program and the Information Technology/Cybersecurity Risk Management Policy and the Board reviews and approves the Company's Information Technology Strategy, including its Information Security Strategy, and its Information Security/Cybersecurity Policy. 
The Compensation Committee assists the Board in evaluating risks arising from Company executive and non-executive compensation programs. The Governance Committee assists the Board in overseeing risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for our directors and executive officers, and corporate governance. The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing risks associated with financial reporting and internal controls. 
Director Independence 
The Board has adopted categorical standards to assist in its evaluation of the independence of directors. These standards describe various types of relationships that could exist between a Board member and the Company and set thresholds at which such relationships would be deemed to be material in the determination of a director's independence. Although any director who meets the independence criteria of Nasdaq and the Board's own categorical standards (as well as Rule 10A-3(b) under the Exchange Act of 1934, in the case of Audit Committee members, and Nasdaq Rule 5605(d)(2), in the case of Compensation Committee members) will be presumed to be independent, the Board may make a decision to the contrary based on its review of any other relevant factors. The Board's categorical standards are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who serves as an executive officer or employee of, or beneficially owns more than a 10% equity  interest in, any corporation, partnership or other business entity that during the most recently completed fiscal year made payments to the Company or received payments from the Company for property or services, is still presumed independent if such  payments were less than the greater of: (a) 5% of such other entity's gross consolidated revenues for such fiscal year; and (b) $200,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who serves as an executive officer or employee of, or beneficially owns more than a 10% equity  interest in, any bank, corporation, partnership or other business entity to which the Company was indebted at the end of its most recently completed fiscal year is still presumed independent if the indebtedness is in an amount less than the greater  of: (a) 5% of such other entity's total consolidated assets at the end of such fiscal year; and (b) $200,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is a member or employee of a law firm that has provided services to the Company during the most  recently completed fiscal year is still presumed independent if the total billings for such services were less than the greater of: (a) 5% of the law firm's gross revenues for such fiscal year; and (b) $200,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is a partner, executive officer or employee of any investment banking firm that has performed  services for the Company (other than as a participating underwriter in a syndicate) during the most recently completed fiscal year is still presumed independent if the total compensation received for such services was less than the greater of:  (a) 5% of the investment banking firm's consolidated gross revenues for such fiscal year; and (b) $200,000.  
[END TABLE]
After a review of all relevant factors and applying these categorical standards and the independence criteria of Nasdaq, the Board determined that, except for Messrs. Lawson and Roessner, all directors and Mr. Ellertson are independent.  The Board also determined that each member of the Company's Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance Committee and Risk Oversight Committee is independent under the applicable standards and that each of Messrs. Carbone and Chersi is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined under SEC rules. 
Identifying and Evaluating Director Nominees 
The Governance Committee uses various methods to identify director nominees. The Governance Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size and composition of the Board and the particular needs of the Board, considering skill sets required and whether any vacancies are expected due to retirement or otherwise. Candidates may come to the attention of the Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other parties. While there is no formal diversity policy or fixed set of qualifications that must be satisfied before a candidate will be considered, we seek nominees with a broad diversity of skills, experience, expertise, professions and backgrounds. All candidates are then evaluated based on a review of the individual's qualifications, skills, independence, experience, expertise and business acumen, including the criteria included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Board's desire to draw on diverse perspectives and expertise in conducting its work. 
Under our Bylaws, there shall be no fewer than six and no more than twelve directors concurrently serving on the Board. Our Bylaws permit the Board to increase or decrease its size within the authorized range and to add new directors between stockholder meetings. Any director appointed by the Board in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
Submission of Director Nominees to the Governance Committee by Stockholders 
The Governance Committee will consider director candidates submitted by any stockholder who has continuously held at least 5% of our voting securities (either directly or as part of a group) for at least one year and is not a competitor of the Company. Such submissions should (i) be accompanied by evidence of the stockholder's ownership during the preceding 12 months; (ii) include a statement that the stockholder is not a competitor of the Company; and (iii) comply with the advance notice requirements set forth in Section 1.08 of the Company's Bylaws. Candidates submitted by any stockholder for election must also comply with the additional requirements set forth in Section 1.09 of the Company's Bylaws. The Governance Committee will follow the same process and use the same criteria for evaluating candidates proposed by stockholders as it does for candidates proposed by other parties. The Governance Committee will consider such candidacy and will advise the recommending stockholder of its final decision. Each Board nominee, at the request of the Board, must submit a statement that, if elected, the nominee intends to comply with the Company's majority voting policy described below. 
Submissions of director candidates by stockholders should be mailed to E*TRADE Financial Corporation, Ballston Tower, 671 North Glebe Road, 15th Floor, Arlington, VA 22203-2120, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
Board Leadership 
The Board currently believes that separating the functions of Chair of the Board, Lead Independent Director and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is appropriate for the Company because it strengthens the Board's independence from management while continuing to leverage the experience and perspective of the Chair of the Board and positions the Company to continue to execute on its commitment to stockholders to grow our core business. 
Majority Voting Standard and Director Resignation Policy 
Our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections is a majority voting standard. Under our majority voting standard, in an uncontested election, each nominee shall be elected to the Board by the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director's election (that is, the number of votes "for" a director's election must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director's election). Directors will be elected by plurality vote in contested elections (that is, when the number of nominees for election exceeds the number of directors to be elected). Whether an election is contested or not is determined on the last day by which stockholders may submit notice to nominate a person for election as a director pursuant to the Company's Bylaws. 
If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in an uncontested election, Delaware law provides that the director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." However, under our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines, each director must submit in advance an irrevocable, contingent resignation to the Chair of the Governance Committee that the Board may accept if the director fails to be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director's election in an uncontested election. In that situation, the Governance Committee will act on an expedited basis to determine whether to recommend that the Board accept the director's   resignation, and submit its recommendation to the Board. The Board will act on the Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind its decision within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. The Governance Committee, in making its recommendation, and the Board, in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. 
The Board expects that any director whose resignation becomes effective pursuant to this policy will excuse himself or herself from participating in the consideration of his or her resignation by either the Governance Committee or the Board. If an incumbent director's resignation is not accepted, he or she will continue to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected, or until his or her earlier removal. All nominees currently serve on the Board. 
Board Evaluation Process 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charter of each committee, on an annual basis our Board and committees each conduct a rigorous self-evaluation process that includes individual evaluations by each director. The process, which proceeds independently from the Company's management, is overseen by our Governance Committee with the assistance of an independent outside advisor. Each director provides written responses and discusses his or her feedback on the performance and effectiveness of the Board and the committees on which they serve. The feedback is compiled anonymously and presented to the Board. The Board believes that this annual evaluation process supports its effectiveness and continuous improvement.  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Introduction 
Our Director Compensation program reflects our desire to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified individuals who have the skills, experience, expertise and background necessary to serve on the board of directors of a company of our size and regulatory complexity and who can continue to guide the Company to provide long-term value to its stockholders. Accordingly, our Director Compensation program is designed to provide our non-employee directors with a mix of cash and long-term equity compensation that both fairly compensates them for the services they provide to us as non-employee directors and aligns their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
2018 Annual Review of Director Compensation Program 
The Governance Committee reviews the structure and philosophy of our Director Compensation program on an annual basis. In the second quarter of 2018, the Governance Committee, supported by its independent compensation consultant, analyzed the overall level and mix of compensation delivered by our Director Compensation program as compared to the Company's peer group and conducted a thorough review of current trends and best practices regarding director compensation. The Governance Committee determined during its 2018 annual review that the existing Director Compensation program remained appropriate and therefore did not make any change to the programs in effect on December 31, 2017. 
In early 2019, the Governance Committee conducted a review of the compensation of our Chair of the Board and our Lead Independent Director determining it was appropriate to realign the compensation of these two roles with respect to the Company's peer group. As a result of this review, the Governance Committee determined it was appropriate to make the following changes to the Director Compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased the additional annual equity compensation for service as the Chair of the Board from $50,000 to  $150,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Decreased the additional annual cash retainer paid for service as the Lead Independent Director from $50,000 to  $25,000; and

• Our non-employee directors who were serving as such on the date of our  2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, other than Mr. Kabat, our Lead Independent Director, each received a grant of restricted stock awards with a fair market value on the date of grant equal to $130,000.

• Mr. Kabat, who was serving as our Lead Independent Director on the date of our 2018 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders, received a grant of restricted stock awards with a fair market value on the date of grant equal to $180,000.  
[END TABLE]
 As a part of our Director Compensation program, non-employee directors may elect, on an annual basis, to defer all or a portion of their cash and equity compensation for service on the Board and/or its committees into deferred restricted stock units ("DSUs") issued under the Company's 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to the terms of our Director Compensation Deferral Program (the "Deferral Program"). Grants of DSUs are issued based on the fair market value of our Common Stock on the grant date (measured as the average of the high and low prices of our Common Stock on the grant date) and fully vest one year following the grant date. At the time of deferral, non-employee directors must elect settlement of the DSUs into shares of our Common Stock. In 2018, directors had the option to elect settlement in (i) one distribution on the first anniversary of the date on which Board service is completed, (ii) five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date on which Board service is completed, or (iii) one distribution 30 days following the date on which Board service is completed. 
Each restricted stock or DSU award, as applicable, granted to a non-employee director in 2018 vests one year from the date of issuance, subject to immediate vesting upon (i) certain changes in the ownership or control of the Company or (ii) the death or disability of the director while serving as a Board member. 
Expense Reimbursement and Perquisites. All non-employee directors receive reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with meetings of the Board and its committees and for attending up to three director education programs. Non-employee directors do not receive perquisites. 
2018 Director Compensation Table 
The following table shows information regarding the compensation paid during 2018 to non-employee directors who served on the Board during the year. Messrs. Lawson and Roessner were both employees of the Company during 2018 and therefore received no compensation under the Director Compensation program.

The fair market value  of the stock awards (measured as the average of the high and low sale prices of our Common Stock on the grant date) for each such non-employee director was equal to $130,000, except Mr. Kabat who received  a grant of stock awards equal to $180,000 in connection with his role as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Carbone elected to receive his annual cash retainer, annual stock compensation and annual cash retainer for service on a special pricing  committee in the form of DSUs in accordance with the Deferral Program.

Equity Ownership Policy for Board of Directors 
The Board believes that directors should hold meaningful equity ownership positions in the Company to help align the interests of directors with those of stockholders. Under our Equity Ownership Policy for directors, non-employee directors are expected to be beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock with a market value equivalent to at least three years of annual cash retainer fees (not including any additional retainer for service as a Committee Chair, Non-Executive Chair of the Board, Lead Independent Director or on an advisory working group or special committee, as adjusted from time to time) within three years of joining the Board. As a result, within three years of joining the Board, each of our non-employee directors is required to hold shares of the Company's Common Stock with an aggregate value of at least $360,000. 
For purposes of the Equity Ownership Policy described above, a non-employee director's shareholdings include, in addition to shares held outright, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"), vested DSUs and the in-the-money portion of vested but unexercised stock options. The value of each RSU and DSU is treated the same as a share of the Company's Common Stock. 
Until a non-employee director has met the requirements of our Equity Ownership Policy, he or she is expected to hold 100% of any stock acquired through exercise of a stock option or vesting of restricted stock, net of shares sold to cover the cost of acquisition and any tax obligation. During 2018, each of the Company's non-employee directors was in compliance with our guidelines. 
Anti-Pledging and Hedging Policy 
The Company's Equity Ownership Policy prohibits directors from engaging in hedging transactions involving the Company's securities. This prohibition extends to short selling and trading in derivatives with respect to the Company's securities. The Equity Ownership Policy also prohibits directors from pledging shares of the Company's common stock.  PROPOSAL 2 
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (THE "SAY-ON-PAY VOTE") 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which Congress adopted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, we are asking that you indicate your support, in a non-binding advisory vote, for the compensation policies and practices relating to our NEOs as described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative appearing on pages 22 through 40 of this Proxy Statement. The next such vote will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
As described in detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we strive to provide a majority of compensation for our NEOs in the form of cash and equity incentives that encourage and reward strong long-term performance and align the financial interests of our NEOs with the interests of our stockholders. Although, as an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the Board or the Compensation Committee, the Board and the Compensation Committee, in exercise of their fiduciary duties, will consider the outcome of the advisory vote in determining future compensation decisions. 
Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (Item 402 of Regulation S-K), including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosures. 
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as described in this Proxy Statement.  PROPOSAL 3 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm responsible for auditing the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, and we are asking the stockholders to ratify its appointment of Deloitte. Deloitte has been retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 1994. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Deloitte to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee of the Board will reconsider the appointment but is not obligated to appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
A representative of Deloitte is expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will be given an opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
Audit Fees Paid to Deloitte & Touche LLP

The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the Company's retention of Deloitte and all audit and non-audit services and fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee either individually or by category. The Audit Committee has reviewed the nature of all non-audit services provided by Deloitte and concluded that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining the firm's ability to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee charter allows the Audit Committee to delegate its authority to pre-approve services to one or more Audit Committee members, provided that the designees present the pre-approvals to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. 
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.  EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY

Our Executive Compensation Philosophy 
Our compensation program for our NEOs is designed to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified individuals and establish a strong link between their pay and the achievement of our business goals. We seek to accomplish these objectives by maintaining a pay-for-performance program heavily weighted toward incentives that promote sustainable long-term performance, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash bonus payments based on important near-term financial and operational goals that the Compensation  Committee believes will improve our long-term results and strategic objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity compensation grants during 2018 consisted of: (1) PSUs, which vest and settle based upon the  achievement of specified pre-established performance criteria over three successive one-year performance periods, and (2) RSUs, which vest ratably over a three-year  period, each subject to continued service to the Company.  
[END TABLE]
In consultation with the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee determined that beginning with grants made in 2019, PSUs will vest and settle based upon the achievement of specified pre-established performance criteria at the end of a single three-year performance period. The new PSU program is designed to align with the Company's long term business strategy and key financial targets and metrics. For 2019 PSU grants, the Compensation Committee set the performance criteria based upon the achievement of a cumulative EPS target over the three-year period and return on the average ROE metric over the three-year period. 
The Compensation Committee believes that granting a mix of performance-based vesting and time-based vesting awards provides the best method to both align the economic interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders and ensure that a significant portion of each NEO's compensation is tied to our long-term stock performance.  Key Compensation Practices and Governance 
Our 2018 compensation program for our NEOs contains the following notable good corporate governance features:

Compensation Considerations for 2018 
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of our compensation program for our NEOs through our annual "say-on-pay vote." The Compensation Committee believes this approval by our stockholders shows strong support for our compensation philosophy of placing significant weight on incentive pay and continues to use that philosophy as the basis for our compensation program. 
Fiscal 2018 Business Highlights. Our business strategy in 2018 centered on two key objectives: accelerating the growth of our core brokerage business to drive organic growth and improve competitive position and generating robust earnings growth and healthy returns on capital to deliver long-term value for our stockholders. To accelerate the growth of our core brokerage business we focused on enhancing the overall customer experience and capitalizing on the value of our corporate services channel. To generate robust earnings growth and healthy returns on capital we focused on utilizing our balance sheet to enhance returns, generating double-digit growth in EPS, putting capital to work for the benefit of our stockholders and executing on our financial commitments. Our executive compensation program has been designed to recognize and support these efforts. 
In determining the appropriate compensation for our NEOs in 2018, the Board and the Compensation Committee considered our business and financial performance. In addition to our metrics and financial results during 2018, they considered the Company's strategic positioning, the Company's accomplishment of various operational, strategic and growth goals, the competitive environment, market developments and the macro-economic environment, as well as compensation of each of the NEO's internal and external peers. 
Mr. Roessner and his team of experienced executives have continued to deliver on our key business objectives, and the Board and the Compensation Committee recognized the following achievements in particular: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We engaged with our customers to generate 282,000 DARTs during 2018, up more than 30% from 2017 and a Company  record.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We implemented $23.0 billion in new stock plan relationships in 2018, a Company record, which compares  favorably to the $25.3 billion implemented during the four prior years combined.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result of our improved capital and cash position, the Company was able to declare its first quarterly cash  dividend of $0.14 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on November 15, 2018. On February 15, 2019, the Company paid its second quarterly common stock dividend.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We completed repurchases under the prior $1 billion share repurchase program and our Board authorized a new  $1 billion share repurchase program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We completed the acquisition of approximately one million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One for a cash  purchase price of $109 million. The acquisition introduced a significant number of retail customers to our platforms and service offerings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We issued $420 million of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (Senior Notes) and used the net proceeds to redeem all  $413 million of outstanding TRUPs during the third quarter of 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We completed the acquisition of TCA, a leading provider of technology and custody services to RIAs for a cash  purchase price of $275 million, which we rebranded E*TRADE Advisor Services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We launched the E*TRADE Advisor Network, a referral program to connect retail customers with qualified RIAs,  which expand our ability to retain retail customers and expand net new assets.

Process for Determining Executive Compensation 
Compensation Committee. As previously described, all members of the Compensation Committee are independent. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and administering compensation programs for our senior executives, including programs for the NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves NEO compensation and, with respect to the compensation of the Executive Chairman, if any, and CEO, recommends their compensation to the independent members of the full Board for approval. 
Compensation Consultants. The Compensation Committee has full authority to retain any consultants it deems appropriate. In 2018, the Compensation Committee again retained Pay Governance LLC as its outside compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on matters including executive compensation practices and market compensation levels. Representatives from Pay Governance LLC attended meetings of the Compensation Committee. No services were provided by Pay Governance LLC to the Company outside of its engagement with the Compensation Committee and the Governance Committee as described above. The Compensation Committee considered all relevant factors in determining the independence of Pay Governance LLC, including those set forth in Rule 10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) under the Exchange Act, and determined no conflicts of interest existed with respect to the Committee's compensation consultant. 
Role of Management. The Compensation Committee works with management, led by the CEO, in an effort to ensure that our NEO compensation programs effectively meet the Compensation Committee's objectives of retaining and motivating highly qualified individuals with the skills and experience necessary to achieve our key business objectives and rewarding desired performance and achievement of goals. In particular, the Compensation Committee considers the CEO's review of the performance of our other executive officers, given his daily experience with them and particular knowledge of their roles. However, the Compensation Committee ultimately makes its own determinations regarding the form and amount of each NEO's compensation and may accept or reject any recommendation from its consultants and management. In addition, the Executive Chairman, if any, and CEO are not present when the Compensation Committee or independent members of the full Board determine their respective compensation. 
Comparative Data. To determine whether our compensation programs are competitive, the Compensation Committee considered publicly available data provided by Pay Governance LLC concerning programs and compensation levels offered by other companies as well as third party survey information in relevant markets and our industry. In particular, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation data for the companies listed below, although it did not target a specific percentile for comparing compensation or place specific weights on the sources of pay information. Instead, it used this information as a reference point when considering whether compensation was appropriate and competitive.  The Compensation Committee conducts a thorough review of the peer comparator group each year to ensure the size, scope, performance and business focus of the peer comparator companies reflect the Company's competitive environment. In 2018, the Compensation Committee, with assistance from Pay Governance LLC, determined it was appropriate to adjust the Company's peer comparator group to better align the group with the Company's business and talent need characteristics. The peer comparator group companies that we used in 2018 are as follows:

[END TABLE]
The total target compensation for 2018 for our NEOs, including each element of compensation and changes in particular elements with respect to certain individuals from 2018, are described below. 
At least once a year, the Compensation Committee reviews "tally sheets" for each of the NEOs. These tally sheets are prepared by Pay Governance LLC, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and quantify the elements of each NEO's total compensation, including potential total annual compensation at different performance levels and the value of outstanding equity awards. The Compensation Committee did not recommend specific changes for NEOs' fiscal 2018 compensation based on this particular review, although it uses the tally sheet information as a resource when considering executive compensation matters. 
The differences in pay among NEOs is a result of the Compensation Committee's review of each NEO's position and level of authority within the Company, experience, unique skill sets, significant achievements, competitive level of total compensation as compared with internal and external peers and/or individual negotiations in connection with accepting employment with the Company. The Compensation Committee also considers compensation of our NEOs in light of changes in roles and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee does not place a specific weight or emphasis on any of these factors. 
2018 Performance Metrics. Our business strategy for 2018 was to accelerate the growth of our core brokerage business and to generate robust earnings growth and healthy returns on capital. Accordingly, our incentive compensation program focused on these areas, but included a significant element associated with strategic and qualitative performance. 
The cash bonuses awarded to NEOs for 2018 performance were based 70% on the Company's pre-tax income for the year and 30% on the achievement of specified quantitative key brokerage metrics, including net new brokerage accounts, net new brokerage assets, margin contribution, daily average revenue trades, managed products and derivative mix. In addition, the Compensation Committee had discretion to adjust the overall cash bonus pool amount upward or downward by 20%. For purposes of the annual cash incentive plan, pre-tax income excludes certain costs relating to regulatory, structural, legal and compliance, executive severance, business disruption, strategic investments and legacy provision (benefit) for loan losses. 
The PSUs granted to NEOs for 2018 performance were based 50% on consolidated EPS targets relating to 2018 and 50% on ROE targets relating to 2018. In addition, the Compensation Committee had discretion to adjust the overall performance factors downward by 20%. 
For additional information regarding the annual cash bonuses paid to the NEOs in early 2019 for 2018 performance and the vesting and settlement of the PSUs that were granted with respect to 2018 performance, please see pages 29 through 30 of this Proxy Statement. 
Determination of Compensation Levels for our NEOs 
Compensation of Our Former Executive Chairman. Mr. Lawson was appointed as our Executive Chairman on September 12, 2016. In connection with his appointment as our Executive Chairman, Mr. Lawson entered into an employment   agreement with us (the "Lawson Agreement"), which remained in effect until his service as our Executive Chairman ceased on December 31, 2018 and Mr. Lawson resumed his position as our non-executive Chair of the Board effective January 1, 2019. 
The Lawson Agreement provided that Mr. Lawson would receive an annual base salary of $850,000. The Lawson Agreement further provided that Mr. Lawson was eligible to receive an annual cash performance bonus for each of 2017 and 2018 with a target of $1,650,000. Mr. Lawson was also eligible to receive an annual equity compensation award for each of 2017 and 2018 with a target of $1,500,000 in the form of PSUs and $1,000,000 in the form of RSUs. 
Compensation of Our CEO. Mr. Roessner entered into an employment agreement with us originally effective September 12, 2016 and later amended effective February 16, 2017, February 9, 2018 and February 8, 2019 (collectively, the "Roessner Agreement"). The Roessner Agreement is scheduled to remain in effect until December 31, 2019. 
In 2018, Mr. Roessner's annual base salary was $1,000,000, his annual cash performance bonus target was $2,000,000 and his annual equity compensation was $3,000,000 ($1,500,000 in the form of PSUs and $1,500,000 in the form of RSUs). For 2019, Mr. Roessner's annual cash performance bonus target increased to $2,500,000, representing an increase of $500,000 over Mr. Roessner's 2018 cash performance bonus target, and his annual equity compensation increased to $4,500,000 ($2,250,000 in the form of PSUs and $2,250,000 in the form of RSUs). The 2019 increases to Mr. Roessner's annual cash performance bonus target and annual equity compensation were made to reflect his increased responsibilities in his role as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company following Mr. Lawson's transition to serving as a non-executive Chair of the Board and to better align his compensation with his external peer group. 
Compensation of Our Current Chief Financial Officer. In connection with Mr. Turner's appointment on December 3, 2018 as the Company's Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved an annual base salary of $500,000, an annual cash performance bonus target of $550,000 and an annual equity compensation award target of $1,050,000 (in the form of RSUs). In February 2019, prior to granting the RSUs to Mr. Turner, the Compensation Committee revised Mr. Turner's equity compensation terms with respect to 2019 performance. As a result, Mr. Turner received annual equity compensation in the amount of $525,000 in the form of PSUs and is eligible to receive a grant of RSUs in early 2020 with a target value of $525,000 in respect of 2019 performance. 
Compensation of Our Former Chief Financial Officer and Current Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Pizzi entered into an employment agreement with us effective February 14, 2017 (the "Original Pizzi Agreement"), which had an initial term that remained in effect until December 31, 2017 and thereafter automatically renewed for additional one-year periods until it was replaced by a new employment agreement effective December 3, 2018 (the "New Pizzi Agreement"). The New Pizzi Agreement has an initial term to remain in effect until December 31, 2019 and thereafter automatically renews for additional one-year periods unless terminated. 
The Original Pizzi Agreement provided that Mr. Pizzi would receive an annual base salary of $600,000. During 2018, Mr. Pizzi's annual cash performance bonus target was $1,300,000 and his annual equity compensation awards were $1,800,000 ($900,000 in the form of PSUs and $900,000 in the form of RSUs). In addition, upon his appointment as Chief Operating Officer on September 21, 2018, Mr. Pizzi was granted an award of RSUs having a grant date fair market value of $500,000. 
The New Pizzi Agreement provides that Mr. Pizzi's annual base salary is increased to $700,000 for 2019. Mr. Pizzi will be eligible to receive an annual cash performance bonus for 2019 with a target of $1,600,000, representing an increase of $300,000 over Mr. Pizzi's 2018 cash performance bonus target, and is eligible to receive equity compensation awards from time to time at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors or its designee. For 2019, Mr. Pizzi's annual equity compensation awards increased to $2,700,000 ($1,350,000 in the form of PSUs and $1,350,000 in the form of RSUs). The 2019 increases to Mr. Pizzi's annual salary, annual cash performance bonus target and annual equity compensation awards were made to better align his compensation with his expanded role and responsibilities as the Company's Chief Operating Officer having, in addition to the finance functions, additional responsibilities over the operations and technology organizations within the Company. 
Compensation of our Former Chief Brokerage Officer and Current Executive Vice President, Institutional and Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee. Mr. Curcio entered into an employment agreement with us effective February 15, 2017, as amended on March 7, 2019 (the "Curcio Agreement"), which will remain in effect until December 31, 2019 and thereafter automatically renews for additional one-year periods unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Curcio Agreement. The Curcio Agreement provides that Mr. Curcio will receive an annual base salary of $600,000, and that he is eligible to receive an annual cash performance bonus and equity compensation awards from time to time at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors or its designee. For 2018, Mr. Curcio's annual cash performance bonus target was $1,300,000 and his annual equity compensation awards were $1,800,000 ($900,000 in the form of PSUs and $900,000 in the   form of RSUs), which the Compensation Committee believes aligns his compensation with that of his external peer group and recognizes his responsibility in leading the achievement of record breaking metrics in the brokerage business. 
Base Salary 
The annual base salary payable to each of our NEOs was set at a level that is reflective of the NEO's position within the Company, experience, unique skills, internal peer and external peer group salaries, and individual negotiations undertaken during the hiring process. We strive to set base salaries for each of our NEOs at levels that are competitive with those paid to similarly situated executives at our peer companies. For 2018, the Compensation Committee made no significant changes to the base salaries of our NEOs. 
Annual Cash Incentive Program 
Annual Cash Incentive Awards. This cash-based element of compensation provides NEOs with an incentive and a reward for achieving meaningful near-term performance objectives that the Compensation Committee believes will lead to sustainable long-term performance. The Compensation Committee believes that it is important to rigorously assess achievement of our performance goals in determining whether and how much to pay in cash bonuses, but that it is also important to retain a degree of flexibility given the nature of our business. The target amount for each of our NEOs was set at a level that is reflective of each individual's position within the Company, the importance of the various business areas or functions overseen to the Company's strategy and success and each individual's overall compensation. 
Cash Awards for 2018 Performance. In 2018, the Compensation Committee established target cash bonus awards for each of our NEOs, in the amounts set forth in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table, for which the actual payout amounts would depend on the Compensation Committee's review of our 2018 performance against the performance criteria described below. In early 2019, after reviewing both our financial and strategic performance, the Compensation Committee approved a total bonus pool based on the factors described below and then determined appropriate individual payments. In determining the total bonus pool for 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that (i) the pre-tax income of the Company, which generally accounts for 70% of the bonus pool, was above budget; and (ii) the Company's key brokerage metrics on an aggregate basis, which generally account for 30% of the bonus pool, and included out-performance with respect to generating net new brokerage accounts, margin contribution and daily average revenue trades, were also above budget. The achievement of these pre-established performance criteria resulted in a bonus pool that was equal to 122.4% of the accrued target budget. The Compensation Committee applied negative discretion to exclude the impact of the unbudgeted increases to the Federal Funds Rate reducing the bonus pool to a total of 115.3% of the accrued target budget. 
Individual Cash Bonus Payouts. In determining the individual NEO payments from this bonus pool, the Board (with respect to the former Executive Chairman and CEO) and the Compensation Committee primarily considered which business areas were most successful and their importance to our strategy and successes, together with its view of leadership and effort by each individual officer and each individual's overall compensation. As further described below, this resulted in each of Messrs. Lawson, Roessner, Turner, Pizzi, and Curcio receiving payments of $1,650,000, $2,250,000, $550,000, $1,600,000 and $1,500,000 respectively. In paying cash bonuses at or above target, the Board (with respect to the former Executive Chairman and CEO) and the Compensation Committee sought to recognize the achievements of the Company during the year and continue to emphasize its objective to pay for performance. 
Given our strong financial and operational results in 2018, all bonus payouts to NEOs who were eligible to receive a bonus with respect to 2018 were at or above target. However, the Board (with respect to the former Executive Chairman and CEO) and the Compensation Committee approved slightly different allocations (as a percentage of targets) due to the particular responsibilities and roles of each individual NEO. Mr. Lawson received 100% of target in line with his employment agreement. Mr. Roessner received 113% of target in recognition of the Company's strong financial results, his responsibility for all of the Company's business units and functions, his leadership of the executive management team and positioning the Company for accelerated growth. Mr. Turner received 138% of target in recognition of his contributions to the Company's finance functions, leadership and strategic positioning, and his increased responsibilities as CFO of the Company. Mr. Pizzi received 123% of target in recognition of his leadership in significant efforts that contributed to the Company's strategic plan and financial results, including the execution against our ambitious capital plan which included the completion of a $1 billion share repurchase program, the launch of the new $1 billion share repurchase program, the Company's issuance of $420 million of 4.50% Senior Notes, the proceeds of which were used to redeem all of our outstanding TRUPs, and his leadership in completing the acquisitions of TCA and the Capital One accounts. Mr. Curcio received 115% of target in recognition of his efforts in leading the brokerage business growth goals in a period during which the Company set numerous brokerage records and was a key leader through a time when the Company achieved exceptional year-over-year growth.  Equity Compensation 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Practices for 2018. We generally grant each of our NEOs an equal mix of both performance-vesting PSUs and time-vesting RSUs. The Compensation Committee believes that awarding an equal mix of time-vesting equity awards and performance-vesting equity awards based on pre-established goals achieves a balance in our equity-based compensation program and serves to further align the interests of our NEOs and our stockholders because the time-vesting RSU grants will continue to provide retention value, while the PSU grants help to further ensure a strong pay-for-performance alignment of our compensation program with stockholder interests and will further motivate our NEOs to strive to achieve our key business and strategic objectives. The target amount for each of our NEOs was set at a level that is reflective of each individual's position within the Company, the importance of the various business areas or functions overseen to the Company's strategy and success and each individual's overall compensation. 
PSU Grants Relating to 2018 Performance. The PSUs that were granted to our NEOs in 2018 are subject to vesting over three successive one-year performance periods, with one-third of the PSUs relating to performance goals with respect to each of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, Messrs. Lawson, Roessner, Pizzi and Curcio were each granted PSUs in 2017, of which a total of one-third were subject to vesting over a one-year performance period relating to 2018 and Messrs. Roessner and Pizzi were each granted PSUs in 2016, of which a total of one-third were subject to vesting over a one-year performance period relating to 2018 performance goals. Accordingly, for Messrs. Roessner and Pizzi, a total of one-third of the PSUs granted in 2016, a total of one-third of the PSUs granted in 2017 and a total of one-third of the PSUs granted in 2018 were subject to vesting based on performance goals relating to 2018. For Messrs. Lawson and Curcio, one-third of the PSUs granted in 2017 and one-third of the PSUs granted in 2018 were subject to vesting based on performance goals relating to 2018. Due to the timing of Mr. Turner's appointment as Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee did not approve a grant of PSUs to Mr. Turner in respect of 2018 performance. 
The performance goals that apply to the PSUs that were subject to vesting based on 2018 performance (the "2018 PSUs") were established at the beginning of 2018. One-half of the 2018 PSUs were subject to the Company's achievement in 2018 of EPS targets, and the other one-half of the 2018 PSUs were subject to ROE targets. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed 2018 performance relative to the pre-established goals and, based on that performance, confirmed that the Company had achieved 156.0% of overall target performance with respect to the 2018 PSUs and applied negative discretion to exclude the impact of the unbudgeted increases to the Federal Funds Rate reducing the payout factor to 136.3%. 
RSU Grants Made in 2018. The RSUs granted to our NEOs in 2018 vest annually over three years, subject to the NEO's continued service to the Company. 
RSU Grants Relating to Prior Performance. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Lawson an RSU award with a grant date fair market value of $1,000,000 in recognition of his leadership over the strategic direction of the Company during a period of invigorated growth, strong financial results and meaningful shareholder returns. In addition, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Pizzi an RSU award relating to 2018 performance with a grant date fair market value of $250,000. These RSU grants will vest ratably over three years, subject to each NEO's continued service to the Company. Because these awards were made in 2019, SEC disclosure rules require that they not be reflected in the "Summary Compensation Table" or "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table below. We are describing these grants in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" because they were made to Messrs. Lawson and Pizzi in recognition of their significant contributions to the Company's success in 2018. 
Equity Ownership Policy for NEOs 
The Compensation Committee believes that requiring significant stock ownership by our NEOs further aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. Under our Equity Ownership Policy in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The former Executive Chairman and the CEO were each expected to beneficially own shares of our common stock with  a market value equal to at least six times his base salary (as adjusted from time to time).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of the other NEOs (as well as certain other employees of the Company) were expected to beneficially own  shares of our Common Stock with a market value equal to at least four times his or her base salary (as adjusted from time to time).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Until an NEO (as well as certain other employees of the Company) has met this equity ownership guideline, he or  she is required to hold 50% of all after-tax shares remaining from the vesting of RSU and PSU awards and 50% of all after-tax shares remaining from the exercise of  vested stock options until such time as the NEO meets the applicable threshold.  
[END TABLE]
 For purposes of the Equity Ownership Policy described above, an NEO's shareholdings include, in addition to shares held outright, any unvested RSUs that vest subject to the NEO's continued service to the Company. The value of each RSU is treated the same as a share of the Company's Common Stock. 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews compliance with these ownership requirements. As of December 31, 2018, all of our NEOs were in compliance with the Equity Ownership Policy. 
Recoupment Policy 
Our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy is applicable to all NEOs and certain other employees. If the Compensation Committee determines that incentive compensation was overpaid as a result of a restatement of our reported financial results or any inaccurate data used to calculate such compensation, the Compensation Committee will review the cash bonus and long-term incentive plan awards granted, vested or accrued and determine the amount and kind of the overpayment. To the extent practicable, in the best interests of stockholders, and as permitted by applicable law, the Compensation Committee will seek to recover or cancel any such overpayments. The Compensation Committee may make determinations of overpayment at any time through the date the Company files its audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year that follows the year for which the inaccurate performance criteria were measured. However, if the Compensation Committee determines that any person purposefully provided inaccurate information or otherwise was culpable in the inaccuracy of the performance metrics, the Compensation Committee is entitled to determine that the overpayment with respect to such person is the entire amount of the bonus or other incentive payment or equity awarded for the applicable year, and without regard to when the event occurred. 
Benefits in Connection with Termination of Employment Relating to Change in Control 
As described in detail (including a quantification of potential benefits) under "Potential Payments on Termination or Change in Control" below, we have entered into agreements with Messrs. Lawson, Roessner, Pizzi and Curcio providing for severance benefits, including enhanced severance benefits in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with a change in control, as well as certain other benefits outside of a change in control. We have also agreed to certain provisions with Mr. Turner providing for severance benefits in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with a change in control. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews these arrangements and considers the costs and benefits, but believes they are appropriate to help alleviate any uncertainty and concern these individuals may have over being terminated and therefore help to ensure that they remain focused solely on their duties. The Compensation Committee balances the potential costs of these arrangements with the need to retain these individuals in a market for top executive candidates that has become increasingly competitive. Our arrangements with these individuals do not provide for tax gross-ups, including with respect to any excise taxes resulting from Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Other Benefit Plans and Perquisites 
We do not offer a defined benefit pension plan or "SERP" for our executives and only provide matching contributions to our 401(k) plan, which are made for NEOs in the same manner as for our other employees. 
We offer a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for our NEOs, but the amounts in a participating executive's plan account consist solely of the deferred compensation portion of his or her salary or cash incentive payments (as elected by the executive) and the market return on the deferred amounts, and we do not provide matching contributions or guaranteed returns. We have retained life insurance policies to support the payment of obligations under this plan. 
Our philosophy is to provide minimal perquisites. We only provide NEOs with an "umbrella" liability insurance policy, providing for insurance coverage for the executive beyond what the executive has retained on his or her own behalf, with a cost per individual of less than $5,000 per year. Beyond this, there are no perquisites offered to our NEOs with anything other than a de minimis value. 
Anti-Pledging and Hedging Policy 
The Company's policies prohibit executive officers and other employees from engaging in hedging transactions involving the Company's securities. This prohibition extends to short selling and trading in derivatives with respect to the Company's securities. The Company's securities are non-marginable for employees, including executive officers. The Equity Ownership Policy also prohibits executive officers from pledging shares of the Company's common stock.  Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million per year on the amount of compensation paid to certain of our executive officers that the Company may deduct for federal income tax purposes. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, substantially modified Section 162(m) and, among other things, eliminated the previously applicable performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit effective as of January 1, 2018. As a result, beginning in 2018, compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million is generally nondeductible, whether or not it is performance-based. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) described above will not apply to compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and is not subsequently materially modified. However, in order to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in accordance with the considerations described in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Compensation Committee will not limit its actions with respect to executive compensation to preserve deductibility under Section 162(m) if the Committee determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Company. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the risk profile of our compensation programs, including a review of both executive and non-executive compensation in a series of meetings with Pay Governance LLC, its independent compensation consultant, and members of our Legal, Human Resources and Risk teams. In particular, the Compensation Committee requested that Pay Governance LLC review all of our incentive plans. We may periodically adjust individual plans in response to this review to ensure that the plans do not pose a material risk to the Company. We believe the compensation program for our NEOs supports long-term growth and does not encourage excessive risk-taking because of the following features, as further described in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis": 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The balance between fixed and variable pay;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Formulaic funding mechanisms and thresholds;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The aggregate bonus pool funding is capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We grant RSU awards with long-term vesting criteria, which we believe prevents a focus on a short-term run-up in our stock price;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EPS governs a portion of the PSU awards, meaning NEOs' goals are directly aligned with the profitability of  the Company and the successful execution of our capital plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Equity Ownership Policy, as further described above, discourages the short-term gain our NEOs could realize  if permitted to sell a large portion of their holdings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive compensation for NEOs depends on balanced use of multiple performance metrics, including pre-established financial performance and business objectives, to avoid placing an undue weight on any particular measure, and assessments by the Compensation Committee of the quantitative and qualitative  performance at the business and individual level;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use of discretion is permitted to allow for the application of informed judgment rather than basing payouts  solely on quantitative allocations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Defined governance structure and policies to ensure proper protocols are in place for incentive compensation plan  review and administration; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We maintain an incentive compensation recoupment policy.

PENSION BENEFITS AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION

Although we have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, none of our NEOs elected to contribute to this plan and there were no aggregate withdrawals, distributions or balances as of December 31, 2018 with respect to any of our NEOs. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Agreements with Named Executive Officers 
Under the terms of their employment agreements and equity award agreements in effect as of December 31, 2018, each NEO (other than Messrs. Lawson and Turner) is entitled to severance benefits in the event of (i) an involuntary termination of the NEO's employment without "Cause" (as defined in the employment agreement) or (ii) a voluntary termination of the NEO's employment due to an event of "Good Reason," in each case subject to the NEO signing a release of claims in favor of the Company. The term "Good Reason" is defined in the applicable agreement, but generally includes such events as a material decrease in compensation; a material, adverse change in the NEO's title, authority, responsibilities or duties; relocation; or a material breach by the Company of the agreement. If the termination occurs in anticipation of, or within two years following, a change in control (which we refer to as a "CIC Termination" below), the severance benefits are increased, as described below. 
The severance benefits for our NEOs (other than Messrs. Lawson and Turner) include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment equal to one times (or two times upon a CIC Termination) the sum of the NEO's base salary  and target cash bonus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A pro-rated annual cash bonus for the year of the termination based on  our actual achievement of the applicable performance objectives for the full year;

As noted above, Mr. Lawson served as the Company's Executive Chairman pursuant to the Lawson Agreement until December 31, 2018. Mr. Lawson did not receive any severance benefits. 
In addition, under our standard forms of equity award agreements for awards granted in 2018, the NEOs, or their estate, as applicable, are entitled to receive the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in the event of the NEO's death or disability. Under their employment agreements, our NEOs (other than Messrs. Lawson and Turner) are also entitled to the payment of a pro-rata portion of the NEO's annual cash bonus in the event of the NEO's death or disability.  The following table shows the estimated value of benefits under each of the above scenarios, assuming the specified event occurred on December 31, 2018.

PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company determined that the annual total compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer in respect of 2018 was approximately 61 times the annual total compensation of the median employee (other than our Chief Executive Officer) in respect of 2018. 
For purposes of the pay ratio calculation, as there has been no change in the employee population or compensation arrangements that would significantly impact the required pay ratio disclosure and there has not been a significant change in the original median employee's circumstances, we have used the same median employee identified last year. As permitted by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, this year we excluded 181 individuals that became employees as a result of our acquisition of TCA during 2018 because their legacy compensation arrangements, which are no longer in place, differed from the remainder of our employee population. 
We originally identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total compensation for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on October 1, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis, excluding contingent and outsourced employees, consultants and interns. To calculate the annual total compensation for each employee we included all compensation earned by the employee for 2017, including, salary, bonus, equity compensation and Company 401(k) contribution, as applicable. During 2018, the median employee's annual total compensation (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $102,732. The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer is set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 34 of this Proxy Statement under the heading "Total Compensation."  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Policies and Procedures for Approval of Related Party Transactions 
The Board has formally adopted a policy with respect to related party transactions that provides the framework under which such transactions are reviewed, approved or ratified. The policy applies to any transaction in which (1) the Company is a participant, (2) any related party (as defined in our policy, which includes the Company's directors, executive officers, any nominee to become a director of the Company, stockholders owning more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, and any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest and (3) the amount involved exceeds $120,000, but excludes any transaction that does not require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing, approving and ratifying any related party transaction. The Governance Committee intends to approve only those related party transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The policy is available, without charge, from our Corporate Secretary and on the Investor Relations section of our website at about.etrade.com in the sub-section titled "Corporate Governance." 
There were no related party transactions identified for 2018. 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings in which any director or executive officer is adverse to the Company. Certain lawsuits we are involved in are discussed under Note 21-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our 2018 Annual Report. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company with the SEC. Officers, directors and beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of the Company's equity securities are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. 
Based solely upon review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that all of our directors, executive officers and owners of more than 10% of our Common Stock complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during 2018.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. 
In accordance with its written charter as adopted by the Board, the Audit Committee of the Board assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee met 13 times and discussed the interim financial information contained in each quarterly earnings announcement with the Company's Chief Financial Officer and independent auditors prior to public release. The members of the Audit Committee, along with other members of the Board, receive director education from its independent auditors at least once a year. The Audit Committee is entirely made up of independent directors as defined in applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules, as well as the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. These independent directors meet in executive session with the Company's independent and internal auditors without management on at least a quarterly basis. 
In discharging its oversight responsibility as to the audit process, the Audit Committee obtained from the independent auditors a formal written statement describing all relationships between the auditors and the Company that may reasonably be thought to bear on the auditors' independence consistent with applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"), discussed with the auditors any relationships that may impact their objectivity and independence, including whether the independent auditors' provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditors' independence, and satisfied itself as to the auditors' independence. The Audit Committee also discussed with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the internal audit function's organization, responsibilities, budget and staffing. The Audit Committee reviewed with both the independent and the internal auditors their audit plans, audit scope and identification of audit risks. 
The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the independent auditors all communications required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and standards of the PCAOB, including those described in Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," and, with and without management present, discussed and reviewed the results of the independent auditors' audit of the consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed the results of internal audit examinations. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, with management and the independent auditors. Management has the responsibility for the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and the independent auditors have the responsibility for the audit of those statements. 
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in its 2018 Annual Report for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also recommended the reappointment, subject to stockholder ratification, of the independent auditors, and the Board concurred in such recommendation.
