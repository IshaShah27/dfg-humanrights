2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
City Office REIT, Inc. is furnishing this Proxy Statement in connection with our solicitation of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). We will hold the Annual Meeting at the Company's Corporate Office at 666 Burrard Street, Suite 3210, Vancouver, BC V6C 2X8, on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time, and any postponements, continuations or adjournments thereof. We are providing this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card to our stockholders commencing on or about March 20, 2019. 
Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this Proxy Statement to "City Office," "CIO," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" are to City Office REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including City Office REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and through which we conduct substantially all of our business (our "Operating Partnership"). 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders will be asked to consider and act upon the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The election of seven directors nominated by our Board of Directors (our "Board of Directors") and  listed in this Proxy Statement to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting and until their successors are elected and qualify;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment, continuation or  postponement thereof.  
[END TABLE]
We completed our initial public offering (our "IPO") in April 2014, and we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in Section 3(a)(80) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). As a result, under Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act, we are exempt from the requirement to include in this Proxy Statement stockholder advisory votes on certain executive compensation matters, such as "say on pay" and "say on frequency" and we qualify for certain scaled executive compensation requirements applicable to emerging growth companies. 
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a printed set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are permitted to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our stockholders by delivering a Notice of Internet Availability of   Proxy Materials in the mail. Unless requested, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instructs you on how to access and review the Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report over the Internet at http://www.astproxyportal.com/ast/18940/. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs you on how you may submit your proxy over the Internet, or how you can request a full set of proxy materials, including a proxy card to return by mail. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting these materials provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"), are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Annual Meeting. 
If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee and intend to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to provide a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other holder of record. 
What are the voting rights of stockholders? 
Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote. There is no cumulative voting. 
How many shares are outstanding? 
At the close of business on March 1, 2019, the Record Date, 39,544,705 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence in person or by proxy of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
What is the difference between a "stockholder of record" and a "street name" holder? 
These terms describe how your shares are held. If your shares are registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC ("AST"), our transfer agent and registrar, you are a "stockholder of record." If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage, bank, trust or other nominee as a custodian, you are a "street name" holder. 
If you are a "street name" holder, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and your broker or nominee is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on how to vote your shares. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person; however, in order to vote your shares in person, you must provide us with a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other stockholder of record. 
How do I vote? 
If you are a registered stockholder, meaning that your shares are registered in your name, you have four voting options. You may vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• over the Internet at the web address noted in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy  card you received (if you have access to the Internet, we encourage you to vote in this manner);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by telephone using the number noted on the proxy card you received (if you received a proxy card);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by signing and dating your proxy card (if you received a proxy card) and mailing it in the prepaid, preaddressed  envelope enclosed therewith; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
Please carefully follow the directions in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card you received. Proxies submitted over the Internet or by telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on May 1, 2019. Proxies submitted by mail must be received by the Company by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on May 1, 2019. 
Can I vote my shares in person at the meeting? 
If you are a "stockholder of record," you may vote your shares in person at the meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name," you must obtain a proxy from your broker, bank, trustee or nominee, giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting. 
What do I need to do to attend the meeting in person? 
Proof of stock ownership and some form of government-issued photo identification (such as a valid driver's license or passport) will be required for admission to the meeting in person. If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, you may contact our Investor Relations at (604) 806-3366. Only stockholders who owned our common stock as of the close of business on March 1, 2019 are entitled to attend the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account, contact your bank or broker to obtain a written legal  proxy in order to vote your shares at the meeting. If you do not obtain a legal proxy from your bank or broker, you will not be entitled to vote your shares, but you can still attend the meeting if you bring a recent bank or brokerage statement  showing that you owned shares of our common stock on March 1, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card? 
It means that you have multiple accounts with our transfer agent and/or with a broker, bank or other nominee. You will need to vote separately with respect to each Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card you received. Please vote all of the shares you own. 
Can I change my vote after I have mailed in my proxy card? 
You may revoke your proxy by doing one of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by sending a written notice of revocation to our Secretary at 666 Burrard Street, Suite 3210, Vancouver, BC V6C  2X8 so it is received prior to the meeting, stating that you revoke your proxy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

 How may I vote for each proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal 1 —     In the election of the seven director nominees, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each  of the director nominees. If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, in an uncontested director election, directors will be elected by receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against the election of such  nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are not treated as votes cast and thus will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the election of directors, although they will be considered present  for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Under our Bylaws, cumulative voting is not permitted.   Under the terms of our director resignation policy included in our Second Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Guidelines (our "corporate governance  guidelines"), by accepting a nomination to stand for election or re-election as a director of the Company or an appointment as director to fill a vacancy or new directorship, each candidate, nominee or  appointee for director agrees that he or she will promptly tender, upon such nomination or appointment and as a condition thereof, a written offer of resignation to the Board, which offer of resignation will be effective on his or her failure to  receive, in an uncontested election of directors, the vote required for election or re-election by the Bylaws. The nominating and corporate governance committee will promptly consider the director's offer  of resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept the resignation or reject it. The Board will act on the nominating and corporate governance committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote.  In determining what action to recommend or take regarding the director's offer of resignation, each of the nominating and corporate governance committee and the Board may consider a range of alternatives as they deem appropriate.   In a contested director election (i.e., where the number of nominees exceeds the number  of directors to be elected at such meeting), the directors will be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. Under the plurality standard, the number of individuals equal to the number of directorships to be filled who receive more votes  than other nominees are elected to the board, regardless of whether they receive a majority of votes cast.

[END TABLE]
None of the proposals, if approved, entitle stockholders to appraisal rights under Maryland law or our Charter.  What are the Board of Directors' recommendations on how I should vote my shares? 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: 
What if I authorize a proxy without specifying a choice on any given matter at the Annual Meeting? 
If you are a stockholder of record as of the Record Date and you properly authorize a proxy (whether by Internet, telephone or mail) without specifying a choice on any given matter to be considered at the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to the Board of Directors' recommendation on that matter. If you are a stockholder of record as of the Record Date and you fail to authorize a proxy or vote in person, assuming that a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, it will have no effect on the result of the vote on any of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. 
What if I hold my shares through a broker, bank or other nominee? 
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), your broker or other nominee may not vote with respect to certain proposals unless you have provided voting instructions with respect to that proposal. 
How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker or other holder of record holding shares of common stock for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Pursuant to Maryland law, abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
Under the rules of the NYSE, brokerage firms may have the discretionary authority to vote their customers' shares of common stock on certain routine matters for which they do not receive voting instructions, including the ratification of independent auditors, and thus brokers may vote at their discretion on Proposal 2 if they do not receive voting instructions from you on Proposal 2. Under the rules of the NYSE, neither Proposal 1 nor Proposal 3 is considered a "routine" matter for purposes of broker discretionary voting and therefore brokers may not vote on Proposal 1 or Proposal 3 if they do not receive voting instructions from you on Proposal 1 or Proposal 3, respectively.  What if I return my proxy card but do not provide voting instructions? 
If you return a signed proxy card but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted by the proxies identified in the proxy card as follows: 
What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? 
We know of no other matters other than the items of business described in this Proxy Statement that can be considered at the meeting. If other matters requiring a vote do arise, the persons named as proxies will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you. 
Who will count the votes? 
A representative of AST or one of its affiliates will act as the inspector of election and will tabulate votes. 
Who pays the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
We will pay the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the proxy materials. We have retained AST to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the passive solicitation of proxies. We expect to pay AST and Broadridge Financial Services, Inc. approximately $20,000 in the aggregate for services rendered, including passively soliciting proxies, reviewing of proxy materials, disseminating of brokers' search cards, distributing proxy materials, operating online and phone voting systems, receiving executed proxies and tabulation of results. We will also request banks, brokers and other holders of record to send the proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, beneficial owners and will reimburse them for their reasonable expenses in doing so. 
How do I submit a stockholder proposal for inclusion in the proxy materials for next year's annual meeting, and what is the deadline for submitting a proposal? 
In order for a stockholder proposal to be properly submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act ("Rule 14a-8") for presentation at our 2020 annual meeting and included in the proxy material for next year's annual meeting, we must receive written notice of the proposal at our executive offices by November 21, 2019. All proposals must contain the information specified in, and otherwise comply with, our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (our "Bylaws"). Proposals should be sent via registered, certified or express mail to: 666 Burrard Street, Suite 3210, Vancouver, BC V6C 2X8, Attention: Anthony Maretic, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. For more information regarding stockholder proposals, see "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations" below. 
The Company's Bylaws provide that, in addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder, but not included in the Company's proxy statement, the stockholder must give timely notice in writing not earlier than October 22, 2019, nor later than November 21, 2019, which is the time period that is not earlier than 150 days nor later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days, notice must be received not earlier than the 150th day prior to the date of the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of   the 120th day prior to the date of the annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which the Company first publicly announces the date of the annual meeting. As to each matter, the notice must contain the information specified in the Bylaws regarding the stockholder giving the notice and the business proposed to be brought before the annual meeting. 
The Company's Bylaws provide that a stockholder of record, both at the time of the giving of the required notice set forth in this sentence and at the time of the 2020 annual meeting, entitled to vote at the annual meeting may nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors by mailing written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company not earlier than October 22, 2019, nor later than November 21, 2019, which is the time period that is not more than 150 days nor less than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days, notice must be received not earlier than the 150th day prior to the date of the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to the date of the annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which the Company first publicly announces the date of the annual meeting. The notice must contain the information specified in the Bylaws regarding the stockholder giving the notice and each person whom the stockholder wishes to nominate for election as a Director. The notice must be accompanied by the written consent of each proposed nominee to serve as one of the Company's directors, if elected. 
In addition to our Bylaws, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. Our Bylaw provisions do not affect any right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in, or our right to omit a proposal from, our Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision). 
If I share my residence with another stockholder, how many copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials should I receive? 
We are sending only a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they share the same last name or we reasonably believe they are members of the same family, unless we have received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address. This practice is known as "householding" and is permitted by rules adopted by the SEC. This practice reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps us to reduce costs. Each stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instructions card. We will deliver promptly, upon written request or oral request, a separate copy of the 2018 Annual Report or Proxy Statement, as applicable, to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents were previously delivered. If you received a single set of these documents for your household for this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, you may direct requests for separate copies in the future to the following address: City Office REIT, Inc., c/o American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219; (800) 937-5449. If you are a stockholder who receives multiple copies of our proxy materials, you may request householding by contacting us in the same manner and requesting a householding consent form. 
What if I consent to have one set of materials mailed now but change my mind later? 
You may withdraw your householding consent at any time by contacting AST at the address and phone number provided above. We will begin sending separate copies of stockholders communications to you within 30 days of receipt of your instructions. 
The reason I receive multiple sets of materials is because some of the shares belong to my children. What happens if they move out and no longer live in my household? 
When we receive notice of an address change for one of the members of the household, we will begin sending separate copies of stockholder communications directly to the stockholder at his or her new address. You may notify us of a change of address by contacting AST at the address and phone number provided above.  Other Information 
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is available at www.sec.gov, and, if you received a printed copy of this Proxy Statement, accompanies this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report. However, the 2018 Annual Report forms no part of the material for the solicitation of proxies. 
The 2018 Annual Report may also be accessed through our website at http://www.cityofficereit.com by clicking on the "Investor Relations" link. At the written request of any stockholder who owns our common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date, we will provide, without charge, additional paper copies of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and financial statement schedule, as filed with the SEC, except exhibits thereto. If requested by eligible stockholders, we will provide copies of the exhibits for a reasonable fee.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prior to the commencement of the audit, the Audit Committee discussed with the Company's management and  independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for the audit. Subsequent to the audit and each of the quarterly reviews, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and  without management present, the results of their examinations or reviews, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of specific judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the  consolidated financial statements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee has discussed with CIO's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, the  matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, ("PCAOB"), in Rule 3200T;

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors: 
William Flatt, Chairman 
John McLernon 
Mark Murski 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Our Compensation Committee consists of Mark Murski, Stephen Shraiberg and John Sweet. No member of the Compensation Committee was at any time after the date of our formation, or currently is, an officer or employee of our company, and no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationship with us requiring disclosure under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K. None of our executive officers serves, or in the past has served, as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve as members of our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee.  Board Leadership Structure 
The Board of Directors believes that it is in the best interests of the Company that the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors be separated in order for the individuals to focus on their primary roles. The Company's Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day to day leadership and performance of the Company, while the Chairman of the Board of Directors provides guidance to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, presides over meetings of the full Board of Directors and sets the agenda for Board of Directors meetings. In addition, the Board of Directors has selected the Chairman to preside over the quarterly meetings of non-management directors. 
Role of our Board of Directors in Risk Oversight 
One of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our risk management process. Our Board of Directors administers this oversight function directly, with support from the three standing committees, our Audit Committee, our Compensation Committee and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, each of which addresses risks specific to its respective areas of oversight. In particular, our Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management takes to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. Our Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our internal audit function. Our Compensation Committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to corporate governance and ethical conduct and monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines, including whether such guidelines are successful in preventing illegal or improper liability-creating conduct. All committees report to the full Board of Directors as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise level risk. In addition, the Board of Directors receives detailed regular reports from members of our senior management and other personnel that include assessments and potential mitigation of the risks and exposures involved with their respective areas of responsibility. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
Our Board of Directors adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that establishes the standards of ethical conduct applicable to all of our directors, officers, employees, consultants and contractors. The code of ethics addresses, among other things, competition and fair dealing, conflicts of interest, financial matters and external reporting, compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, company funds and assets, confidentiality and corporate opportunity requirements and the process for reporting violations of the code of ethics, employee misconduct, conflicts of interest or other violations. Any waiver of our code of ethics with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Chief Operating Officer and President, or persons performing similar functions may only be authorized by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and will be promptly disclosed as required by law and NYSE regulations and posted on our website. Amendments to the code of ethics must be approved by our Board of Directors and will be promptly disclosed and posted on our website (other than technical, administrative or non-substantive changes). Our code of ethics is publicly available on our website at http://www.cityofficereit.com and in print to any stockholder who requests a copy. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board of Directors adopted corporate governance guidelines that serve as a flexible framework within which our Board of Directors and its committees will operate. These guidelines cover a number of areas including the size and composition of our Board of Directors, Board of Directors membership criteria and director qualifications, director responsibilities, Board of Directors agenda, roles of the Chairman of the Board of   Directors and chief executive officer, meetings of independent directors, committee responsibilities and assignments, Board of Directors member access to management and independent advisors, director communications with third parties, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, evaluation of senior management and management succession planning. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review our corporate governance guidelines at least once a year and, if necessary, recommend changes to our Board of Directors. Additionally, our Board of Directors adopted independence standards as part of our corporate governance guidelines. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines is posted on our website at http://www.cityofficereit.com. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors or any of its committees may do so by writing to the Chairman of the Board, Board of Directors of City Office REIT, Inc., c/o Secretary, 666 Burrard Street, Suite 3210, Vancouver, BC V6C 2X8. The Secretary will review all communications received. All communications that relate to matters that are within the scope of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors and its committees are to be forwarded to the Chairman of the Board. Communications that relate to matters that are within the scope of responsibility of one of the Board committees are also to be forwarded to the chairman of the appropriate committee. Solicitations, junk mail and obviously frivolous or inappropriate communications are not to be forwarded, but will be made available to any director who wishes to review them.  PROPOSAL NO. 2. RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM 
On February 26, 2019, the Audit Committee approved appointing KPMG LLP to serve as CIO's independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. KPMG LLP has served as our independent public accountants since our initial public offering in April 2014. 
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accountants for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of KPMG LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of CIO. A representative of KPMG LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS 
VOTE "FOR" THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP TO AUDIT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OF CIO FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019. 
Audit Fees

[END TABLE]
Exchange Act rules generally require any engagement by a public company of an accountant to provide audit or non-audit services to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee of that public company. This pre-approval requirement is waived with respect to the provision of services other than audit, review or attest services if certain conditions set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X are met. All of the audit and audit-related services described above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee and, as a consequence, such services were not provided pursuant to a waiver of the pre-approval requirement set forth in this Rule. The Audit Committee charter provides guidelines for the pre-approval of independent auditor services. All of the audit and audit-related services described above were completed by full-time, permanent employees of KPMG LLP.  PROPOSAL NO. 3. TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS MADE THEREUNDER AND CERTAIN OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES 
Background to the Proposal 
Our Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") was adopted in 2014 in connection with our initial public offering. The Plan permits the grants of stock options, restricted common stock, restricted stock units, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights ("DERs") and other equity-based awards (including LTIP Units). A total of 1,263,580 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Plan. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 397,957 shares (and approximately 228,309 shares as of March 6, 2019) of our common stock remain available for issuance for equity-based awards under the Plan. 
The Board of Directors believes that the Plan has benefited the Company by assisting in recruiting and retaining the services of individuals with ability and initiative and enabling such individuals to participate in the future services of the Company and by associating the interests of such individuals with the interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
On March 7, 2019, the Board of Directors amended the Plan, subject to the approval of stockholders (the "Amendment"). The Amendment is described below and include an increase in the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the Plan from 1,263,580 shares to 2,263,580 shares. 
The increase in the Plan's share authorization will continue the Company's ability to provide incentive and equity compensation opportunities pursuant to the Plan. The Board of Directors believes that the Company's ability to provide competitive levels and types of compensation, including equity and incentive compensation opportunities, is important to recruiting and retaining talented executives and other key employees. Absent stockholder approval of the Amendment, the share authorization under the Plan will be exhausted and the Company will be unable to provide equity and incentive compensation pursuant to awards granted under the Plan. The Company thus will be required to use cash-based awards as the medium of payment for all incentive compensation. 
The Amendment is described below and the material features of the Plan, as amended by the Amendment, are summarized below. A copy of the Plan as amended by the Amendment, is included as Appendix A to this proxy statement. The summary below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Plan. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN. 
Summary of the Amendment 
As more fully described below, the Amendment (i) increases the Plan's share authorization; (ii) conforms the Plan to changes to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 enacted under by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA"); (iii) eliminates references to our former external advisor; (iv) extends the expiration date of the Plan and (v) updates references to our new corporate executive offices at 666 Burrard Street, Suite 3210, Vancouver, BC V6C 2X8. 
Share Authorization 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 397,957 shares (approximately 228,309 shares as of March 6, 2019) of the Plan's original 1,263,580 share authorization remain available. The Amendment will increase the aggregate share authorization by 1,000,000 shares (from 1,263,580 shares to 2,263,580 shares).  In determining the proposed increase in the Plan's share authorization, the Board of Directors considered anticipated share usage over the next five years for equity-based awards given past equity grant practices and the expected growth of the Company over the next five years, the size of the proposed increase relative to the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, and the Company's understanding of its investors' perceptions of the appropriate size of the increase in the Plan's share authorization. The Board of Directors believes that the additional share authorization included in the Amendment will be sufficient to provide competitive equity grants to eligible employees over the next few years and will not be perceived by most shareholders as overly dilutive. In the event that our shareholders do not approve the Amendment at the 2019 Annual Meeting, we expect that we will have to adopt a cash-based incentive program in early 2020, which may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executives and directors, and potentially could be detrimental to our results of operations. 
Code Section 162(m) 
Code Section 162(m) limited the deduction that a public corporation may claim for compensation paid to certain executive officers. Prior to the TCJA, the deduction limit under Code Section 162(m) did not apply to compensation that qualified as "performance based." 
The Plan included several provisions and references that were intended to allow awards to qualify as "performance based" compensation, including individual limits on the awards that any participant could receive in a year. Those provisions and references are not required after the TCJA and therefore are eliminated by the Amendment. However, the individual grant limits are not affected by the Amendment and awards under the Plan continue to be subject to those limitations. 
Reference to Advisor 
Prior to February 1, 2016, we were externally managed by City Office Real Estate Management, Inc. (the "Advisor"). The Plan included several references to the Advisor, including allowing employees of the Advisor to receive grants under the Plan. We are no longer managed by the Advisor and the references to the Advisor and its employees are removed from the Plan by the Amendments. 
Term of the Plan 
The original term of the Plan was for a ten year period from the effective date ending in 2024. The Amendment extend the term of the Plan until January 1, 2029. 
Corporate Address 
The existing Plan also contains references to our prior executive offices at 1075 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC V6E 3C9. The Amendment updates such references to our new corporate address at 666 Burrard Street, Suite 3210, Vancouver BC V6C 2X8. 
Summary of the Plan, as Amended by the Amendment 
The summary of the Plan appearing below is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Plan, as amended by the Amendment. As used in this summary, the term "Grant" means the issuance of an Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Phantom Share, DER, or other equity-based grant as contemplated herein or any combination thereof as applicable to an eligible person. All capitalized terms in this summary not defined in this summary shall have the meaning in the Plan. 
Plan Administration 
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors or, if there is no compensation committee, by our Board of Directors (the "plan administrator"). The plan administrator has the   full authority to administer and interpret the Plan; to authorize the granting of awards; to determine the eligibility of individuals to receive awards under the Plan; to determine the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award (subject to the individual participant limitations provided in the Plan); to determine the terms, provisions and conditions of each award (which may not be inconsistent with the terms of the Plan); to prescribe the form of agreement evidencing awards; and to take any other actions and make all other determinations that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the Plan or the administration or interpretation thereof. In connection with this authority, the plan administrator may, among other things, establish performance goals that must be met in order for awards to be granted or to vest, or for the restrictions on any such awards to lapse. The committee administering the Plan will consist of directors, each of whom is intended to be, to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, a non-employee director. 
Eligibility 
The plan administrator selects, from the eligible individuals, those individuals who receive awards under the Plan. Individuals eligible for awards are our officers, directors, advisors and personnel, and, with approval of our Board of Directors, those of our subsidiaries and their affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual is an eligible person only if shares of our common stock issued under awards to that person are eligible for registration with the SEC on a registration statement on Form S-8. 
Available Shares 
The Plan provides for grants of restricted common stock, restricted stock units, phantom shares, stock options, DERs and other equity-based awards (including LTIP Units), subject to the total number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the Plan was 1,263,580 shares prior to the Amendment. The Amendment seeks to increase this maximum number to 2,263,580. The maximum number of shares that may underlie awards of options granted in any one year to any eligible person may not exceed 150,000 shares and the maximum number of shares that may underlie awards other than options granted in any one year to an eligible person may not exceed 150,000 shares. The aggregate share limit and the individual grant limitations are subject to adjustment in the event of specified changes in our capitalization, including share splits and share dividends. The grant of an LTIP Unit shall count against the aggregate and individual limits on a one-for-one basis, treating each LTIP Unit covered by an award as one share of common stock for these purposes. To the extent an award granted under Plan expires or terminates, the shares subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. In addition, if any phantom shares are paid out in cash, the underlying shares may again be made the subject of grants under the Plan. Unless previously terminated by our Board of Directors, no new award may be granted under the Plan on or after January 1, 2029, the tenth anniversary of the effective date of such plan as amended by the Amendment. 
Awards under the Plan 
Restricted Shares of Common Stock. A restricted stock award is an award of shares of common stock that is subject to restrictions on transferability and such other restrictions, if any, that the plan administrator may impose at the date of grant. Grants of restricted shares of common stock may be subject to vesting schedules as determined by the plan administrator. The restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times and under such circumstances, including, without limitation, a specified period of employment or the satisfaction of pre-established criteria, in such installments or otherwise, as the plan administrator may determine. Except to the extent restricted under the award agreement relating to the restricted shares of common stock, a participant granted restricted shares of common stock has all of the rights of a stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote and the right to receive dividends on the restricted shares of common stock, although dividends paid with respect to unvested restricted shares of common stock may be subject to satisfaction of the vesting criteria of the underlying shares, and, in the case of dividends paid with respect to unvested restricted shares that do not   vest solely upon satisfaction of continued employment or service, such dividends will be held by us and paid when, and only to the extent that, the underlying shares vest. 
Restricted Stock Units. A restricted stock unit award represents the right to receive shares of our common stock in the future, after the applicable vesting criteria, determined by the plan administrator, has been satisfied. The holder of an award of restricted stock units has no rights as a stockholder until shares of our common stock are issued in settlement of vested restricted stock units. Our plan administrator may provide for a grant of DERs in connection with the grant of restricted stock units; provided, however, that if the restricted stock units do not vest solely upon satisfaction of continued employment or service, any payment in respect to the related DERs will be held by us and paid when, and only to the extent that, the related restricted stock units vest. 
Phantom Shares. A phantom share represents a right to receive the fair value of a share of common stock, or, if provided by the plan administrator, the right to receive the fair value of a share of common stock in excess of a base value established by the plan administrator at the time of grant. Phantom shares will vest as determined by the plan administrator and specified in the applicable award agreement and may generally be settled in cash or by transfer of shares of common stock (as may be elected by the plan administrator, or, if permitted by the plan administrator, by the participant). Our plan administrator may provide for a grant of DERs in connection with the grant of Phantom shares which shall be payable at such time that dividends are paid on outstanding shares; provided, however, that if the phantom shares do not vest solely upon satisfaction of continued employment or service, dividend equivalent payments in respect of unvested phantom shares will be held by us and paid when, and only to the extent that, the related phantom shares vest. 
Stock Options. A stock option award is an award of the right to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at a fixed exercise price determined on the date of grant during a period of not more than ten years. Stock option awards may either be incentive or non-qualified stock options, provided that incentive stock options may only be granted to employees. The exercise price of stock options must equal at least the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant; provided, however, that an incentive stock option held by a participant who owns, or is deemed to own under applicable attribution rules, more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, or of certain of our subsidiary corporations, may not have a term in excess of five years and must have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The plan administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include certified or bank cashier's check, shares of our common stock owned by the participant, cancellation of indebtedness owed by us to the participant, by certain loans or extensions of credit to the extent permitted by applicable law, or a combination of the foregoing or another method of payment acceptable to the plan administrator. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the plan administrator determines the remaining terms of the options (e.g., vesting). After the termination of service, the participant may exercise his or her option, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, for the period of time stated in his or her option agreement. If termination is due to death or disability, the option, to the extent vested, generally will remain exercisable for 12 months. In all other cases, to the extent vested, the option generally will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term. A participant shall have no rights as a stockholder until the participant exercises the option and a stock certificate is issued to the participant. 
Other Share-Based Awards. The Plan authorizes the granting of other awards based upon shares of our common stock (including the grant of securities convertible into shares of common stock and share appreciation rights), subject to terms and conditions established at the time of grant by the plan administrator. The Plan also permits the grant of operating partnership long-term incentive plan units ("LTIP Units"). LTIP Units are a special class of units in our operating partnership. Each LTIP Unit awarded by the plan administrator will be equivalent to an award of one share, reducing the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan on a one-for-one basis. In addition to the provisions of the Plan, LTIP Units shall be subject to the provisions of our partnership agreement.  Dividend Equivalent Rights. The plan administrator may, in its discretion, grant awards of DERs. DERs provide the participant with the right to receive a payment, in cash or shares as determined by the plan administrator, determined in reference to dividends paid on our common stock. DERs typically are granted in connection with the grant of another type of award under the Plan, such as restricted stock units, although this is not required. DERs granted with respect to awards that do not vest solely upon satisfaction of continued employment or service shall entitle the participant to receive a payment only as, and only to the extent that, the related award vests. 
Amendments and Termination 
Our Board of Directors may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan but cannot take any action that would impair the rights of a participant with respect to grants previously made without such participant's consent. However, no amendment will be effective without the approval of our stockholders if the amendment (i) increases the number of shares that may be issued under the Plan (other than an increase to reflect changes in capitalization as provided in the Plan), (ii) change the class of eligible persons who may participate under the Plan, (iii) reprices a stock option or other award or (iv) requires stockholder approval in order to comply with applicable law or the requirements of an applicable stock exchange. 
Change in Control 
Under the Plan, a change in control is generally defined as the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the acquisition of more than 50% of (a) our voting shares or (b) all of our shares, by any person; (ii) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; (iii) a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange where our stockholders immediately prior to such event hold less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving or resulting entity; (iv) during any 12-calendar-month period, our directors, including subsequent directors recommended or approved by our directors, at the beginning of such period cease for any reason to constitute a majority of our Board of Directors; or (v) our liquidation or dissolution. 
Upon a change in control, the plan administrator may make such adjustments to the Plan and outstanding awards as it, in its discretion, determines are necessary or appropriate in light of the change in control. In addition, upon a change in control, all awards granted under the Plan shall vest in full, with stock options being exercisable as to all of the covered shares of common stock and all vesting criteria applicable to other awards treated as having been fully satisfied immediately prior to, but contingent on, the change in control. 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following is a very general description of some of the basic U.S. federal income tax principles that apply to awards under the Plan. The grant of an option will create no tax consequences for the participant or the Company. A participant will have no taxable income upon exercise of an incentive stock option, except that the alternative minimum tax may apply. Upon exercise of a non-qualified option, a participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares acquired minus the exercise price. Upon a disposition of shares acquired by exercise of an incentive stock option before the end of the applicable incentive stock option holding periods, the participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise minus the exercise price or (2) the amount realized upon the disposition of the option shares minus the exercise price. Otherwise, a participant's disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of an option generally will result in capital gain or loss. Other awards under the Plan, including restricted stock units and phantom shares generally but excluding LTIP Units, will result in ordinary income to the participant at the later of the time of delivery of cash or shares, or the time that either the risk of forfeiture or restriction on transferability lapses on previously delivered shares or other property. LTIP Units are taxed under partnership taxation rules, and the recipient generally will have no tax consequences until distributions are made with respect to the LTIP Units. Except as discussed below, we generally will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant in connection with an   award, but will be entitled to no tax deduction relating to amounts that represent a capital gain to a participant. Thus, we will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to an incentive stock option if the participant holds the shares for the incentive stock option holding periods. 
Please note, the foregoing is general tax discussion and different tax rules may apply to specific participants and transactions under the Plan. 
New Plan Benefits 
Except for any common shares that may be issued in settlement of awards previously approved by the compensation committee, as described in this proxy statement under "Executive Officer and Director Compensation," the Company is unable to estimate or describe the Grants that may be issued under the Plan, as amended (if the amendments are approved by the stockholders) because the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors will determine the Grants that may be issued during the term of the Plan. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN.  OTHER MATTERS 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors does not intend to present and has not been informed that any other person intends to present any other matters for action at the Annual Meeting. However, if other matters do properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote upon them in accordance with their best judgment. 
Except as set forth in this section, all shares of common stock represented by valid proxies received will be voted in accordance with the provisions of the proxy.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth the number and percentage owned by each person who, to the knowledge of CIO as of March 6, 2019, is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock. This information is reported in accordance with the beneficial ownership rules of the SEC under which a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power with respect to such security or has the right to acquire such ownership within 60 days. Shares of common stock issuable pursuant to options, warrants, rights or conversion privileges are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person or group holding such options, warrants, rights or conversion privileges but are not deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated in footnotes to the table, each person listed has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the securities owned by such person.

Mr. Tylee received a bachelor's degree in accounting from Brock University and is a chartered accountant. Mr. Tylee brings accounting and finance skills as well as over 20 years of diverse real estate experience that includes acquisitions of various types of income-producing property and high-rise development. 
Anthony Maretic 
Mr. Maretic, age 47, is our chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer since our IPO in April 2014. He has over 20 years of experience in senior financial and operational roles, of which 14 years were spent within the real estate industry.

Mr. Maretic is a chartered accountant and holds a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration from the University of British Columbia.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Policies with Respect to Conflicts of Interest 
We adopted a code of ethics and related persons transactions policy that prohibits transactions involving conflicts of interest between us on the one hand, and our officers, employees and directors on the other hand, except for such transactions that are approved by a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) in compliance with the code of ethics and related persons transactions policy. A "conflict of interest" arises when the private interest of a person covered by the code interferes in any material respect with our interests or his or her service to us. Waivers of our code of ethics for certain covered persons must be disclosed in accordance with NYSE and SEC requirements. In addition, our Board of Directors is subject to certain provisions of Maryland law, which are also designed to eliminate or minimize conflicts. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will always succeed in eliminating the influence of such conflicts. If they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of all stockholders. 
We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or any of our affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. 
Administrative Services Agreement 
In connection with the internalization of our management in February 2016, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with the Second City funds. The Administrative Services Agreement has a three year term and pursuant to the agreement, the Company, including Jamie Farrar and Gregory Tylee, will provide various administrative services and support to the related entities managing the Second City funds. The Company's subsidiary received or will receive annual payments for these services under the Administrative Services Agreement as follows: first 12 months—$1.5 million, second 12 months—$1.15 million and third 12 months—$0.625 million, for a total of $3.275 million over the three-year term. 
On October 29, 2018, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Administrative Services Agreement with real estate investment funds affiliated with Second City Capital II Corporation and Second City Real Estate II Corporation ("SCRE II"). The terms of the Amendment became effective on February 1, 2019 (the "Effective Date"). After February 1, 2019, the annual fees payable to the Company will be $500,000 for the first twelve months following the Effective Date and thereafter an amount equal to 40% of the management fee paid to SCRE II by the fund managed by SCRE II. 
The terms of the Administrative Services Agreement and our executive officers' employment agreements permit, under certain circumstances and subject to the oversight of the Board, our executive officers to advise or oversee new or additional funds in the future.  EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Our named executives and their principal offices during 2018 were:

[END TABLE]
There were no other executive officers of CIO other than our CEO, COO and President and CFO, Treasurer and Secretary serving at the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Overview of Compensation Program and Philosophy 
On February 1, 2018, we entered into employment agreements with our named executive officers. In addition, we continue to have the ability to compensate our named executives, other officers and individuals with equity and equity-based awards or other types of awards in accordance with our equity incentive plan ("EIP") intended to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders. Awards that may be granted under our EIP include unrestricted stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, dividend equivalents, other stock based awards and any other right or interest relating to stock or cash (collectively referred to herein as "awards"). Our Compensation Committee will determine if and when any of our named executives, other officers or individuals will receive such awards. As discussed below, our Compensation Committee awarded restricted stock units to the named executives in January 2018 which related to CIO's 2017 performance. A restricted stock unit award represents the right to receive shares of our common stock in the future, after the applicable vesting criteria, determined by our Compensation Committee, as plan administrator, has been satisfied. The holder of an award of restricted stock units has no rights as a stockholder until shares of our common stock are issued in settlement of vested restricted stock units. A recipient may be issued dividend equivalency rights by our Compensation Committee in connection with the grant of restricted stock units; provided, however, that if the restricted stock units do not vest solely upon satisfaction of continued employment or service, any payment in respect to the related grant of dividend equivalency rights will be held by us and paid when, and only to the extent that, the related restricted stock units vests. 
2018 Company Performance 
In applying our compensation program and philosophy to the named executives in 2018, the Compensation Committee sought to recognize the executive management team's financial and strategic accomplishments during 2018. During 2018, the Company acquired $260 million of office properties. These acquisitions consisted of 5 properties and over 1 million square feet in Denver, Phoenix and Orlando. We also disposed of a property in a non-target market and recognized a $47.0 million accounting gain. The Company also increased occupancy of its' portfolio from 87.7% when excluding the property that was held for sale at December 31, 2017 to 90.4% at December 31, 2018. The Compensation Committee believes that we continue to successfully execute our business objectives and investment strategies. We provide an analysis of our financial and operational performance in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Employment Agreements 
As discussed above, on February 1, 2018, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the Employment Agreements with each of James Farrar, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Greg Tylee, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Anthony Maretic, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. 
The Compensation Committee approved the terms of the Employment Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreements, Messrs. Farrar and Tylee were paid an initial annual base salary of $400,000 and   Mr. Maretic an annual base salary of $250,000. In addition, each of Messrs. Farrar, Tylee and Maretic are eligible to receive an annual bonus based on the achievement of performance goals that are established by the Board of Directors. The executives are also eligible to participate in the Company's EIP pursuant to which they may be entitled to receive restricted stock units, options or other equity awards as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Equity-Based Compensation 
As discussed above, the Compensation Committee may, from time to time pursuant to the EIP, grant our named executives certain equity-based awards. These awards are designed to align the interests of our named executives with those of our stockholders, by allowing our named executives to share in the creation of value for our stockholders through capital appreciation and dividends. These equity awards are generally subject to vesting requirements, and are designed to promote the retention of management and to achieve strong performance for our company. These awards provide a further benefit to us by enabling us to attract, motivate and retain talented individuals. On March 9, 2017, we adopted stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers and independent directors. This policy requires that each of our independent directors achieve ownership of our common stock having an aggregate value of at least three times his or her total annual base compensation in effect as of the date he or she first became an independent director prior to the fifth anniversary of the earlier of (a) February 1, 2016 or (b) the date he or she was first elected or appointed an independent director. In addition, we adopted a policy requiring each of our executive officers to achieve ownership of our common stock having an aggregate value of a certain multiple of the executive's annual base salary. Such multiples are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position    Multiple   
 Chief Executive Officer      4x   
 Chief Operating Officer and President      3x   
 Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary      3x   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also intends to design long-term incentive awards to ensure that our named executives have a continuing stake in our long-term success, that the total compensation realized by our named executives reflects our multi-year performance as measured by the efficient use of capital and changes in stockholder value, and that a large portion of their total compensation opportunity is earned over a multi-year period and could be forfeitable in the event of termination of their service to us or our affiliates. 
REIT regulations require us to pay at least 90% of our earnings to stockholders as dividends. As a result, we believe that our common stockholders are principally interested in receiving attractive risk-adjusted dividends and in the growth of dividends and market capitalization. Accordingly, we want to provide incentives to our named executives that rewards success in achieving these goals. Since we generally do not have the ability to retain earnings, we believe that equity-based awards serve to align the interests of our named executives with the interests of our stockholders since the value our named executives receive from these awards is largely dependent on the value of our common stock, the potential for appreciation of that value and our capability to pay dividends. We believe that this alignment of interests provides an incentive to our named executives to implement strategies that will enhance our overall performance and promote growth in dividends and growth in our market capitalization. 
The Compensation Committee does not use a specific formula to calculate the number of equity awards and other rights awarded to our named executives under our EIP. The Compensation Committee does not explicitly set future award levels/opportunities on the basis of what the named executives earned from prior awards. While the Compensation Committee will take past awards (if any) into account, it will not solely base future awards in view of those past awards. Generally, in determining the specific amounts to be granted to an individual, the Compensation Committee will take into account factors such as our performance, the individual's position, his or her contribution to our performance, and general market practices of our peers and similarly sized companies. Awards, if any, are granted on an annual basis.  Grants of Equity Compensation to our Executive Officers 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, pursuant to the restricted stock unit award agreements and under our Equity Incentive Plan, we issued 48,350 restricted stock units to Mr. Farrar, 48,350 restricted stock units to Mr. Tylee and 29,175 restricted stock units to Mr. Maretic. These restricted stock unit award agreements were approved by the Company's Board of Directors, as recommended by the Compensation Committee, on January 25, 2018, pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan. The awards were made pursuant to restricted stock unit award agreements between the Company and each of its executive officers, subject to vesting over a three-year period. Restricted stock units vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date and shall vest in full upon the termination of employment without Cause (as defined in the form of award agreement). If earned, the restricted stock units will be settled in the form of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, or if approved by the Compensation Committee, in cash of equivalent value. Restricted stock units do not entitle the recipient the rights of a holder of common stock until shares are issued in settlement of the vested units. The restricted stock units carry the right to receive dividends pursuant to the RSU award agreements, which will be reinvested in shares of our common stock and delivered to the applicable executive upon, and subject to, satisfaction of the vesting criteria applicable to the related restricted stock units. In connection with the declaration of dividends $0.235 per share on December 15, 2017, of $0.235 on March 21, 2018, $0.235 per share on June 15, 2018, and $0.235 per share on September 14, 2018, Mr. Farrar was granted an additional 8,761 restricted stock units, Mr. Tylee was granted an additional 8,761 restricted stock units and Mr. Maretic was granted an additional 5,167 restricted stock units. These additional restricted stock units vest in accordance with the same vesting schedule, and upon the same conditions, as the underlying restricted stock units as to which the dividend equivalent rights were granted with respect to (generally vesting on the first three annual anniversaries of the original grant date). Future awards will be at the discretion of our Compensation Committee. 
Risk Management and CIO's Compensation Policies and Procedures 
As part of the Board of Director's role in risk oversight, the Compensation Committee considers the impact of our compensation plans, policies and practices, and the incentives created by the same, on our risk profile. Based on this consideration, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation policies and procedures are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on CIO. Some of the factors the Compensation Committee considered as mitigating the risks of our compensation plans include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee retains discretion to determine incentive awards based on its consideration of  multiple performance factors and does not rely on a purely formulaic approach; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CIO would respond to any executive misconduct in the manner described below under "Potential Impact on  Compensation from Executive Misconduct."  
[END TABLE]
The Effect of Regulatory Requirements on Our Executive Compensation 
IRC Section 409A. Section 409A of the IRC applies to all forms of nonqualified deferred compensation. The Compensation Committee will take Section 409A into account in determining the form and timing of compensation paid to our executives in the event CIO provides any nonqualified deferred compensation. 
IRC Sections 280G and 4999. IRC Section 280G limits our ability to take a tax deduction for certain "excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G) and IRC Section 4999 imposes excise taxes on each executive that receives "excess parachute payments" paid by CIO in connection with a change in control. The Compensation Committee does not expect to provide any compensation that would be considered an "excess parachute payment." 
Accounting Rules. Various rules under generally accepted accounting principles determine the manner in which CIO accounts for grants of equity-based compensation to our employees in our financial statements. The  Compensation Committee takes into consideration the accounting treatment of alternative grant proposals under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, "Stock Compensation" (formerly, FASB Statement 123R), or FASB ASC Topic 718, when determining the form and timing of equity compensation grants to employees, including our named executives. The accounting treatment of such grants, however, is not determinative of the type, timing, or amount of any particular grant of equity-based compensation to our employees. 
Potential Impact on Compensation from Executive Misconduct. If the Board of Directors determines that an executive officer has engaged in fraudulent or intentional misconduct, the Board of Directors would take action to remedy the misconduct, prevent its recurrence, and impose such discipline on the officer as would be appropriate. Discipline would vary depending on the facts and circumstances, and may include, without limit, termination of employment, initiating an action for breach of fiduciary duty and, if the misconduct resulted in a significant restatement of our financial results, seeking reimbursement of any portion of performance-based or incentive compensation paid or awarded to the executive that is greater than would have been paid or awarded if calculated based on the restated financial results, including cancellation or forfeiture of equity-based incentive compensation. These remedies would be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any actions imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities.

 Director Compensation 
We have approved and implemented a compensation program for our non-employee directors that consists of annual retainer fees and long-term equity awards. As compensation for serving on our Board of Directors, each director receives an annual base fee for his or her services of $30,000. In addition, each non-employee director receives a meeting fee of $1,000 for attending each Board of Directors meeting, committee meeting or telephonic meeting to approve investments. The Chairman of the Board of Directors receives an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000, the chair of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000, and the chairs of the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Investment Committee receive an additional annual cash retainer of $5,000. 
We also reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their duties as directors, including, without limitation, travel expenses in connection with their attendance in-person at Board of Directors and committee meetings. 
Beginning on August 12, 2014 and until March 9, 2017, an independent director share grant program approved by our Board of Directors provided for each independent director to be granted a number of restricted stock units, up to 1,500 annually, equal to the number of shares of our common stock that such director purchased on the open market. The matching restricted stock units vested ratably over three years and carried the right to receive dividends (through the issuance of dividend equivalent rights), which were reinvested in shares of our common stock and delivered to the applicable independent director upon, and subject to, satisfaction of the vesting criteria applicable to the related restricted stock unit award agreements. Pursuant to this program, each of the independent directors were granted restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2017. On March 9, 2017, our Board of Directors repealed our independent director share grant program upon adoption of the minimum share ownership policy discussed above under " — Equity-Based Compensation." 
On January 18, 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded our directors with restricted stock units. The restricted stock units vest ratably over three years and carry the right to receive dividends (through a related grant of dividend equivalent rights), which will be reinvested in shares of our common stock and delivered to the applicable executive upon, and subject to, satisfaction of the vesting criteria applicable to the related restricted stock units. Pursuant to this program, each of Mr. McLernon, Mr. Flatt, Mr. Kohn, Mr. Murski and Mr. Shraiberg were granted 3,000 restricted stock units. 
We do not have, and we do not currently intend to adopt, any plans or programs for our directors that provide for pension benefits. 
The table below sets forth information regarding the compensation paid or accrued by CIO during 2018 to each of our directors. James Farrar did not receive any additional compensation in connection with his role as a director.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and to furnish CIO with copies of all such reports. 
Based solely on a review of the copies of such reports received by the Company and on written representations from certain reporting persons that no reports were required, or if required, such reports were filed on a timely basis for those persons, the Company believes that reports were filed on a timely basis by all directors in 2018.

If any Phantom Shares or DERs are paid out in cash, the underlying Shares may again be made the subject of Grants under the Plan, notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6. A Grant of LTIP Units under Section 13 hereof shall be treated for purposes of the limits in this Section 6 as a Grant covering Shares on a 1 Share for 1 LTIP Unit basis."

9.  Section 9(c)(i) of the Plan is hereby modified as follows:  
[END TABLE]
Each Grantee of Restricted Stock shall be issued a certificate in respect of Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan. Such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Grantee. Without limiting the generality of Section 6, in addition to any legend that might otherwise be required by the Board or the Company's charter, bylaws or other applicable documents, the certificates for Shares of Restricted Stock issued hereunder may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer hereunder or under the applicable Agreement, or as the Committee may otherwise deem appropriate, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall bear a legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Grant, substantially in the following form: 
THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING FORFEITURE) OF THE CITY OFFICE REIT, INC. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AND AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE REGISTERED OWNER AND CITY OFFICE REIT, INC.

"Grant of DERs. Subject to the other terms of the Plan, the Committee shall, in its discretion as reflected by the terms of the Agreements, authorize the granting of DERs to Eligible Persons based on the dividends declared on Common Stock, to be credited as of the dividend payment dates, during the period between the date a Grant is issued, and the date such Grant is exercised, vests or expires, as determined by the Committee. Such DERs shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitation as may   be determined by the Committee. If a DER is granted in respect of another Grant hereunder, then, unless otherwise stated in the Agreement, or, in the appropriate case, as determined by the Committee, in no event shall the DER be in effect for a period beyond the time during which the applicable related portion of the underlying Grant has been exercised or otherwise settled, or has expired, been forfeited or otherwise lapsed, as applicable. With respect to DERs granted with respect to Grants that vest upon satisfaction of criteria other than solely continued service, payment in settlement of the DERs shall not be made to the Grantee prior to the date on which, and only to the extent that, the related Grant vests and the DERs shall be forfeited in the event, and to the extent, the related Grant is forfeited."

14.  Section 16(a) of the Plan is hereby modified as follows:  
[END TABLE]
"(a) Subject to any required action by stockholders and to the specific provisions of Section 17, if (i) the Company shall at any time be involved in a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, reorganization, exchange of shares, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of the Company or a transaction similar thereto, (ii) any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than ordinary cash dividends, shall occur or (iii) any other event shall occur which in the judgment of the Committee necessitates action by way of adjusting the terms of the outstanding Grants, then: 
(i) the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be made subject to Options and DERs under the Plan, the maximum aggregate number and kind of Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that may be granted under the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Phantom Shares and other Grants which may be granted under the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee in its discretion; and 
(ii) the Committee shall take any such action as in its discretion shall be necessary to maintain each Grantees' rights hereunder (including under their applicable Agreements) so that they are, in their respective Grants, substantially proportionate to the rights existing in such Grants prior to such event, including, without limitation, adjustments in (A) the number and kind of shares or other property to be distributed in respect of the Grant, (B) the Exercise Price, Purchase Price and Phantom Share Value, and (C) performance-based criteria established in connection with Grants; provided that, in the discretion of the Committee, the foregoing clause (C) may also be applied in the case of any event relating to a Subsidiary if the event would have been covered under this Section 16(a) had the event related to the Company. In addition, the Committee may provide a cash bonus in lieu of adjustment if it determines such a bonus is appropriate. 
To the extent that such action shall include an increase or decrease in the number of Shares (or units of other property then available) subject to all outstanding Grants, the number of Shares (or units) available under Section 6 above shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, proportionately." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  Section 16(j) of the Plan is hereby modified as follows:  
[END TABLE]
"Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of any one of the following events: 
(i) any "person," including a "group," (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, but excluding the Company, any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Company, any trustee, fiduciary or other person or entity holding securities under any employee benefit plan or   trust of the Company or any such entity, and, with respect to any particular Eligible Employee, the Eligible Employee and any "group," (as such term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of which the Eligible Employee is a member), is or becomes the "beneficial owner," (as defined in Rule 13(d)(3) under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of either (A) the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities or (B) the then outstanding Shares; or 
(ii) members of the Board at the beginning of any consecutive 12-calendar-month period (the "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason other than due to death to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided that any Director whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved or ratified by a vote of at least a majority of the members of the Board then still in office who were members of the Board at the beginning of such 12-calendar-month period, shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director; or 
(iii) there shall occur (A) any consolidation or merger of the Company or any Subsidiary where the stockholders of the Company, immediately prior to the consolidation or merger, would not, immediately after the consolidation or merger, beneficially own (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, shares representing in the aggregate 50% or more of the voting securities of the corporation issuing cash or securities in the consolidation or merger (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any), (B) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any party as a single plan) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or (C) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change of Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of the foregoing clause (i) solely as the result of an acquisition of securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Shares or other voting securities outstanding, increases (x) the proportionate number of Shares beneficially owned by any person to 50% or more of the Shares then outstanding or (y) the proportionate voting power represented by the voting securities beneficially owned by any person to 50% or more of the combined voting power of all then outstanding voting securities; provided, however, that, if any person referred to in clause (x) or (y) of this sentence shall thereafter become the beneficial owner of any additional Shares or other voting securities (other than pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend, or similar transaction), then a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this subsection (j). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no event or condition shall constitute a Change of Control to the extent that, if it were, an excise tax would be imposed upon or with respect to any Grant under Section 409A of the Code; provided that, in such a case, the event or condition shall continue to constitute a Change of Control to the maximum extent possible (e.g., if applicable, in respect of vesting without an acceleration of distribution) without causing the imposition of such excise tax."
