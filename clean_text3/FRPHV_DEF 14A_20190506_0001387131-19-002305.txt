Dear Shareholder:
You are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting of the shareholders of FRP Holdings, Inc. ("FRP") to be held on May 6, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., local time, in the Concourse Conference Room at 200 West Forsyth Street, Jacksonville, Florida 32202.
We are soliciting proxies for use at the annual meeting of FRP's shareholders to consider and vote upon proposals to (i) elect the six director nominees listed in the proxy statement for a one-year term (the "Director Election Proposal"), (ii) ratify the audit committee's selection of the independent auditor (the "Auditor Proposal"), and (iii) approve, on an advisory basis, the executive compensation of our named executive officers (the "Compensation Proposal"). Our board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the foregoing proposals.
Your vote is very important. The approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the Auditor Proposal and the Compensation Proposal each requires approval by a majority of FRP common stock votes cast on the matter at the annual meeting. The outcome of the Director Election Proposal will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, please vote your shares by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card as soon as possible to make sure that your shares of FRP common stock are represented at the annual meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name" you should instruct your broker how to vote in accordance with your voting instruction card.
The accompanying proxy statement provides you with detailed and important information about the annual meeting and the other business to be considered by FRP's shareholders. We encourage you to read the entire proxy statement carefully. You may also obtain more information about FRP from documents we have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, brokers are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approval of non-routine matters, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, brokers will not vote those shares. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote". Broker non-votes will be considered as "present" for purposes of determining a quorum, but will have no effect on the Proposals.

The FRP Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the Director Election Proposal, "FOR" the Auditor Proposal and "FOR" the Compensation Proposal.
Change in Fiscal Year
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company changed its fiscal year to January 1 through December 31. Prior to such date, the Company's fiscal year commenced on October 1 and ended September 30.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
The following are some questions that you, as a shareholder of FRP, may have regarding the annual meeting, together with brief answers to those questions. FRP urges you to read carefully the remainder of this proxy statement and other documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, because the information in this section may not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to the annual meeting.
The Annual Meeting
The Director Election Proposal: The FRP Board has determined that it is in the best interests of FRP shareholders to elect John D. Baker II, Charles E. Commander III, H. W. Shad III, Martin E. Stein, Jr., William H. Walton III and Margaret Wetherbee to serve as directors of the Company until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

The Compensation Proposal: The FRP Board has determined that it is in the best interests of FRP shareholders to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation awarded to our named executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
FRP does not expect to transact any other business at the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Voting at the Annual Meeting TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Auditor Proposal: This proposal requires the approval by a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the annual meeting. Any shares not voted (whether by abstention or withholding authority) will have no effect on the Auditor Proposal.
The Compensation Proposal: This proposal requires the approval by a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the annual meeting. Any shares not voted (whether by abstention, withholding authority, or broker non-vote) will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal.
As of the record date, the FRP directors and named executive officers own or control 17.76% of FRP's outstanding shares of common stock and intend to vote such shares "FOR" each of the Proposals.
If your shares of FRP common stock are registered directly in your name with FRP's transfer agent, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the "shareholder of record," and the proxy materials and proxy card are being sent directly to you by FRP.
As a shareholder of record, you may vote your shares at the annual meeting:
Everyone attending the annual meeting may be required to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. If your shares are held through an account with a broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, you will need a recent brokerage account statement or letter from your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee reflecting stock ownership as of the record date. If you do not have valid picture identification and, if applicable, a recent brokerage account statement or letter from your broker, dealer, bank or other nominee reflecting stock ownership as of the record date, you may not be admitted to the annual meeting. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Assuming the presence of a quorum, the failure to return your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares at the annual meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Proposals.
If a beneficial owner of shares of FRP common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the broker, dealer, bank or other nominee, then those shares will not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the Proposals. TABLE OF CONTENTS
As the beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend the annual meeting in person. However, since a beneficial owner is not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the annual meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, dealer, bank or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares in person at the annual meeting.

Director Attendance at Annual Meeting of Shareholders
It is a policy of the Company that our directors are required to attend the annual meeting of shareholders unless extenuating circumstances prevent them from attending. All directors expect to be present at this year's annual meeting of shareholders.
Director Independence
Pursuant to NASDAQ listing standards, the FRP Board is required to evaluate each director to determine whether he or she qualifies as an "independent director." The FRP Board must determine that a director has no relationship that, in the judgment of the FRP Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by the director in carrying out his or her responsibilities. The listing standards specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined. The listing standards also prohibit Audit Committee and Compensation Committee members from any direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and restrict commercial relationships of all directors with the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arm's length with the Company and its subsidiaries and to disclose any circumstances that might be perceived as a conflict of interest.
The FRP Board has determined that four of our six current directors and director nominees (Charles E. Commander III, H.W. Shad III, Martin E. Stein, Jr. and William H. Walton III) are independent of management in accordance with the listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market. All of the members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent directors.
Independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions without management and may select a director to facilitate the meeting. The independent directors met in executive session five times during 2018, with Mr. Commander presiding over each executive session.
Nominating Process
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") identifies individuals whom the Nominating Committee believes are qualified to become FRP Board members in accordance with the director qualification standards set forth below, and recommends selected individuals to the FRP Board for nomination to stand for election at the next meeting of shareholders of the Company in which directors will be elected. In the event there is a vacancy on the FRP Board between meetings of shareholders, the Nominating Committee identifies individuals that the Nominating Committee believes are qualified to become FRP Board members in accordance with the Director Independence Standards set forth above, and recommends one or more of such individuals for appointment to the FRP Board.
In the event the Nominating Committee recommends an increase in the size of the FRP Board or a vacancy occurs, the Nominating Committee may consider qualified nominees from several sources, including current FRP Board members and search firms. The Nominating Committee may from time to time retain a search firm to help the Nominating Committee identify qualified director nominees for consideration by the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee evaluates qualified director nominees against the current director qualification standards described below and reviews qualified director nominees with the FRP Board. The Nominating Committee and the Chairman of the FRP Board interview candidates who meet the director qualification standards, and the Nominating Committee selects nominees who best suit the FRP Board's current needs and recommends one or more of such individuals for appointment to the FRP Board. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director Qualification Standards
The Nominating Committee has established the following standards and qualifications for members of the FRP Board:
In considering diversity in the selection of nominees, the Nominating Committee looks for individuals with varied experience, background, knowledge, skills and viewpoints in order to achieve and maintain a group of directors that, as a whole, provides effective oversight of the management of the Company. Although our nomination policy does not prescribe specific standards for diversity, the FRP Board and Nominating Committee do look for nominees with a diverse set of skills that will complement the existing skills and experience of our directors and provide an overall balance of diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences. The FRP Board recognizes the value of gender and racial diversity among its members.
Nominees Proposed by Shareholders
The Nominating Committee will consider properly submitted shareholder nominees for candidates for membership on the FRP Board. Shareholders proposing individuals for consideration by the Nominating Committee must include, at a minimum, the following information about the proposed nominee: the proposed nominee's name, age, business or residence address, principal occupation or employment, and whether such person has given written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected. Shareholders should send the required information about the nominee to:
Corporate Secretary 
FRP Holdings, Inc.
200 W. Forsyth Street, 7th Floor

The Corporate Secretary will send properly submitted shareholder proposed nominations to the Nominating Committee chair for consideration at a future Nominating Committee meeting. Individuals proposed by shareholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration that individuals identified to the Nominating Committee through other means receive. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Nominations by Shareholders at Annual Meeting
Pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, directors may be nominated at a meeting of shareholders at which directors are being elected, by (1) the FRP Board or any committee or person authorized or appointed by the FRP Board, or (2) by any shareholder who is entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting and who complies with certain advance notice procedures. These notice procedures require that the nominating shareholder make the nomination by timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, the notice must be received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than forty (40) days prior to the meeting except that, if less than fifty (50) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given to shareholders, the notice must be received no later than ten (10) days after the notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. The notice must contain certain information about the proponent and each nominee, including such information about each nominee as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the rules of the SEC had such nominee been nominated by the FRP Board.
Board Leadership
John D. Baker II serves as the Chairman of the FRP Board and as FRP's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Baker has served as a director of the Company since 1986, served as the President and Chief Executive Officer from 2008 to 2010 and was again appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company on March 13, 2017. From 1996 to 2007, Mr. Baker served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Rock Industries, Inc. Mr. Baker currently serves as a director for Wells Fargo & Co. and has formerly served as a director for several other public companies.
It is a policy of the Company that when the Chairman of the FRP Board is not an independent director, the independent directors will annually appoint a lead independent director.
Mr. Commander currently serves as lead independent director. The lead independent director presides over executive sessions of the independent directors and performs other duties as may be assigned from time to time by the FRP Board.
The FRP Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility and oversight between management and the independent members of the FRP Board. It does this by giving primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our Chief Executive Officer, while enabling the lead independent director to facilitate the FRP Board's independent oversight of management. The FRP Board believes its programs for overseeing risk, as described under the "Risk Oversight" section below, would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and therefore do not materially affect its choice of structure.
Committees
The FRP Board currently has five directors and the following four committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Executive Committee. The membership during 2018 and the function of each committee are described below.
In 2018, the FRP Board held five meetings, the Audit Committee held four meetings, the Compensation Committee held two meetings and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held one meeting. TABLE OF CONTENTS
During 2018, the Executive Committee did not hold any formal meetings but voted on various matters by unanimous written consent. The independent directors met in executive sessions following all Board meetings. With the exception of the absence of two directors from one board meeting each, all of our directors attended all of the meetings of the FRP Board and all committees on which the director served. Except for the Executive Committee, each of the committees of the FRP Board is composed exclusively of independent directors.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the FRP Board in its oversight of the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of the Company's financial statements, the integrity of the Company's financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and the qualifications, independence, and performance of the Company's independent auditor. In addition to other responsibilities, the Audit Committee also: TABLE OF CONTENTS
The FRP Board has determined that all Audit Committee members are independent and are able to read and understand financial statements. The FRP Board has also determined that the Chair of the Committee, H.W. Shad III, qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations. The charter of the Audit Committee (as adopted on December 3, 2014) is available on our website at www.frpholdings.com under Corporate Governance.
Compensation Committee
The primary functions of the Compensation Committee are to discharge the responsibilities of the FRP Board relating to the compensation of the Company's executive officers and prepare an annual report on executive compensation to be included in the Company's proxy statement. In addition, the Compensation Committee:
None of the members of the Compensation Committee was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during the 2016 Stub Period or fiscal year 2017 or had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company under the rules of the SEC requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related party transactions. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officer serving the FRP Board or Compensation Committee.
The charter of the Compensation Committee (as adopted on December 3, 2014) has been formally adopted by the Company and is available at www.frpholdings.com under Corporate Governance.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The primary functions of the Nominating Committee are to (1) identify individuals who are qualified to serve on the Company's Board of Directors, (2) recommend for selection by the FRP Board the director nominees for the next annual meeting of the shareholders, (3) review and recommend to the FRP Board changes to the corporate governance practices of the Company, and (4) oversee the annual evaluation of the FRP Board. In addition, the Nominating Committee establishes criteria for the FRP Board membership.
The charter of the Nominating Committee (as adopted on December 3, 2014) is available at www.frpholdings.com under Corporate Governance. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Executive Committee
John D. Baker II and John D. Milton, Jr. (ex officio), comprised the Executive Committee during fiscal year 2018. To the extent permitted by law, the Executive Committee exercises the powers of the FRP Board between meetings of the FRP Board.
Business Conduct Policies
We believe that operating with honesty and integrity has earned us trust from our customers, credibility within our communities, and dedication from our employees. Our senior executive and financial officers are bound by our Financial Code of Ethical Conduct. In addition, our directors, officers and employees are required to abide by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. These policies cover many topics, including conflicts of interest, protection of confidential information, fair dealing, protection of the Company's assets and compliance with laws, rules and regulations.
Employees are required to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of these policies. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
The Financial Code of Ethical Conduct and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (as adopted on December 3, 2014) is available on our website at www.frpholdings.com under Corporate Governance.
Risk Oversight
The FRP Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risk to the Company. Management annually (or periodically in the event greater frequency is required due to unforeseen circumstances) prepares an enterprise risk assessment and mitigation strategy that it reviews with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reports to the FRP Board, which in turn, provides guidance on risk appetite, assessment and mitigation.
Board and Committee Self-Assessment
It is a policy of the Company that the FRP Board and each committee, under the supervision of the Nominating Committee, conduct a self-evaluation of their performance at least annually. The self-evaluation process serves to assess the FRP Board's and the committees' performance and effectiveness during the previous year. Each member of the FRP Board and each committee member completes a questionnaire that addresses various aspects of the FRP Board or committee's meetings, membership, culture, relationship with management and other committees and role and responsibilities and solicits recommendations for the upcoming year.
Communication with Directors
The FRP Board has adopted the following process for shareholders to send communications to members of the FRP Board. Shareholders may communicate with the chairs of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees of the FRP Board, or with our independent directors, by sending a letter to the following address: Board of Directors, FRP Holdings, Inc., c/o Corporate Secretary, 200 W. Forsyth Street, 7th Floor, Jacksonville, Florida 32202. TABLE OF CONTENTS

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC, NASDAQ and the Company. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company and written representations from the Company's executive officers and directors, the Company believes all persons subject to these reporting requirements filed the required reports on a timely basis during fiscal year 2018.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions With Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc.
On January 30, 2015, we completed a spin-off of our former transportation business. The spin-off was effected through a corporate reorganization, followed by the distribution by the Company of all of the shares of common stock of Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. ("Patriot"; NASDAQ – PATI). Patriot now fully owns and operates the transportation business that was formerly a segment of FRPH, and FRPH fully owns and operates the real estate business. For more information regarding the Spin-off, you may refer to Patriot's Information Statement, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to Patriot's Form 10, filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on December 31, 2014, available at www.sec.gov.
In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and a transition services agreement, which provide a framework for our relationships with Patriot after the spin-off. These agreements provide for the allocation between Patriot and the Company of the assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries, and govern the relationships between Patriot and the Company (including with respect to transition services, employee matters, real property matters, tax matters, and certain other commercial relationships). This summary of the agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, which are listed as exhibits to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 3, 2015.
In the opinion of the Company, the terms, conditions, transactions and payments under the agreements with the persons described above were not less favorable to the Company than those which would have been available from unaffiliated persons.
Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee of the FRP Board is responsible for reviewing and approving all material transactions with any related party not previously approved by the Company's independent directors. This responsibility is set forth in writing in our Audit Committee charter, a copy of which is available at www.frpholdings.com under Corporate Governance. In certain cases, transactions have been approved by a committee consisting of all independent directors. Related parties include any of our directors or executive officers, and certain of our shareholders and their immediate family members.
To identify related party transactions, each year, we submit and require our directors and officers to complete director and officer questionnaires identifying any transactions with us in which the officer or director or their family members have an interest. We review related party transactions due to the potential for a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an individual's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, in any way with our interests. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires all directors, officers and employees who may have a potential or apparent conflict of interest to immediately notify our Chief Financial Officer.
We expect our directors, officers and employees to act and make decisions that are in our best interests and encourage them to avoid situations which present a conflict between our interests and their own personal interests. Our directors, officers and employees are prohibited from taking any action that may make it difficult for them to perform their duties, responsibilities and services to the Company in an objective and effective manner. In addition, we are strictly prohibited from extending personal loans to, or guaranteeing personal obligations of, any director or officer. Exceptions are only permitted in the reasonable discretion of the FRP Board. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available at www.frpholdings.com under Corporate Governance. TABLE OF CONTENTS
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the FRP Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The Audit Committee also selects the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee held four formal meetings in fiscal year 2018.
In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of the Company's results and the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management represented to the Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to applicable standards adopted by the PCAOB.
In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by the applicable requirements of PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with us concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditor the auditor's independence from the Company and its management. The Audit Committee also has considered whether the independent auditor's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the independent auditor is independent from the Company and its management.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed Company policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent auditor the overall scope and plans for the audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the FRP Board, and the FRP Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Audit Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material, and shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the Audit Committee Report by reference therein. TABLE OF CONTENTS
PROPOSAL NO. 2: THE AUDITOR PROPOSAL
The Audit Committee has selected Hancock Askew as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (auditors) to examine the consolidated financial statements of the Company, subject to satisfactory negotiation of an annual fee agreement for 2019. The FRP Board seeks an indication from shareholders of their approval or disapproval of the Audit Committee's appointment of Hancock Askew as the Company's auditors.
Hancock Askew has been our independent auditor since 2006, and no relationship exists between the Company and Hancock Askew other than the usual relationship between auditor and client.
If the appointment of Hancock Askew as auditor for 2019 is not approved by the shareholders, the adverse vote will be considered a direction to the Audit Committee to consider other auditors for next year. However, because of the difficulty in making any substitution of auditors so long after the beginning of the current year, Hancock Askew will remain the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019, unless the Audit Committee finds other good reason for making a change.
Representatives of Hancock Askew will be available to respond to questions at the annual meeting of shareholders.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has selected Hancock Askew to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, subject to satisfactory negotiation of an annual fee agreement. Representatives of Hancock Askew are expected to be present at the shareholders' meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Audit and Non-Audit Fees
The following table presents fees billed or to be billed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, and for other services performed during such periods. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services
Under the Company's amended Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all auditing services and permissible non-audit services, including related fees and terms, to be performed for the Company by its independent auditor, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described under the Exchange Act which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit. The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit services, audit-related services and tax review, compliance and planning services performed for the Company by Hancock Askew during fiscal years 2017 and 2018. TABLE OF CONTENTS
PROPOSAL NO. 3: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
In accordance with Section 14A of Exchange Act we are asking shareholders to vote "FOR" approval of our executive compensation program. This non-advisory vote is commonly referred to as "say-on-pay."
We design our executive officer compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain the key executives who drive our success and industry leadership. Our compensation program consists of several forms of compensation: base salary, cash incentive bonuses, equity compensation and other benefits and perquisites. Pay that reflects performance and alignment of that pay with the interests of long-term shareholders are key principles that underlie our compensation program. The FRP Board believes that our current executive compensation program directly links executive compensation to our performance and aligns the interest of our executive officers with those of our shareholders.
Shareholders are urged to read the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement, which contains tabular information and narrative discussion about the compensation of our named executive officers.
Because this is an advisory vote, it will not be binding on the FRP Board. However, the FRP Board and the Compensation Committee will review and take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.
Accordingly, the FRP Board proposes that you indicate your support for the Company's compensation philosophy, policies, and procedures and their implementation in 2019 as described in this proxy statement.
Compensation Policies
Internal Pay Equity. We believe that internal pay equity is an important factor to be considered in establishing compensation for the officers. We have not established a policy regarding the ratio of total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to that of the other officers, but we do review compensation levels to ensure that appropriate equity exists.
Compensation Risk Assessment. The Compensation Committee considers the risks that may result from the Company's compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation policies and practices for our executives are reasonable and properly align their interests with those of our shareholders. The Compensation Committee believes that there are a number of factors that cause our compensation policies and practices to not have a material adverse effect on the Company. The fact that our executive officers have their annual incentive compensation tied to return on capital employed encourages actions that promote profitability. Our equity-based incentives further align the interest of our executives with the long term interests of our shareholders. In addition, we believe that there are significant checks in place so that employees whose compensation may have a shorter term focus are managed by employees and officers whose compensation has a longer term focus.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation Should be Maximized Where Appropriate. The Company generally seeks to maximize the deductibility for tax purposes of all elements of compensation. For example, the Company always has issued nonqualified stock options that result in a tax deduction to the Company upon exercise. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for non-qualifying compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to any such persons in any 1 year. We review compensation plans in light of applicable tax provisions, including Section 162(m), and may revise compensation plans from time to time to maximize deductibility. However, we may approve compensation that does not qualify for deductibility when we deem it to be in the best interests of the Company. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Financial Restatement
It is a policy of the FRP Board that the Compensation Committee will, to the extent permitted by governing law, have the sole and absolute authority to make retroactive adjustments to any cash or equity based incentive compensation paid to executive officers and certain other officers where the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement. Where applicable, the Company will seek to recover any amount determined to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive.
Clawback Policy
It is our policy, under the Equity Incentive Plan, that any equity compensation granted to executives subject to recovery under any law, regulation or listing requirement will be subject to deductions and clawback as required by such law, regulation or listing requirement.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We are currently considered a "smaller reporting company" for purposes of the SEC's executive compensation and other disclosure rules. In accordance with such rules, we are required to provide a Summary Compensation Table and an Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table, as well as limited narrative disclosures.
Summary Compensation Table
The Summary Compensation Table sets forth information concerning the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and the 2016 Stub Period. Our compensation program consists of several forms of compensation: base salary, cash incentive bonuses, equity compensation and other benefits and perquisites.

The MIC Plan provides officers an opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus for achieving specified performance based goals. Due to the Company's recent fiscal year change, non-equity incentive awards for the periods reflected in this table were determined and awarded based on the 12-month period beginning October 1, 2016 and ending September 30, 2017 and the 15-month period beginning October 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2018 (each, an "MIC Period"). The annual bonus pool is determined by the Company's achievement of target performance goals, subject to a threshold, target and maximum amount, and individual awards are expressed as a percentage of each officer's base salary and are determined by the achievement of individual performance goals, all of which is set by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis. Each year, a portion of each named executive officer's cash bonus is contingent upon a determination that the internal control over financial reporting for the company was effective during the applicable year.
For the 15-month MIC Period ending December 31, 2018, John D. Baker II and David H. deVilliers, Jr. were eligible to receive bonuses in an amounts of up to 125% of their base salaries, and David H. deVilliers III was eligible to receive a bonus in an amount of up to 81.25% of his base salary. Bonuses were contingent upon the Company's achievement of (i) an operating profit target and (ii) a target for square feet leased during the period. Each target accounted for 50% of the bonus pool, but an achievement in excess of one target (up to 20%) could be applied to eliminate any corresponding deficit in meeting the other target. The maximum bonus pool was available upon the achievement of an operating profit of $15,088,300 and 759,239 square feet leased. The target operating profit and square feet leased were $14,552,409 and 588,477, respectively, which would have resulted in the achievement of 80% of the eligible bonus pool. The threshold operating profit and square feet leased were $13,205,700 and 465,000, respectively, which would have resulted in the achievement of 50% of the eligible bonus pool. Maximum bonuses were awarded for the 15-month MIC Period ending December 31, 2018 based on the partial performance of the Company during such MIC Period in light of the sale of the Company's warehouse business on May 21, 2018.
For the 12-month MIC Period ending September 30, 2017, John D. Baker II, David H. deVilliers, Jr. and David H. deVilliers III were eligible to receive bonuses in amounts of up to 75%, 100% and 60% of their base salaries, respectively. Bonuses were contingent upon the Company's achievement of (i) a budgeted net income of $5,991,811 and (ii) a target for square feet leased during the period. The achievement of the budgeted net income was required for the award of any bonuses under the MIC Plan, and the bonus pool was subject to be prorated based on square feet leased. The maximum bonus pool was available upon the achievement of 777,745 square feet leased. The target square feet leased was 577,745, which would have resulted in the achievement of 80% of the eligible bonus pool. The threshold square feet leased was 457,984, which would have resulted in the achievement of 5% of the eligible bonus pool. TABLE OF CONTENTS

Severance and Change of Control Agreements
On December 5, 2007, the Company entered into a change-in-control agreement with David H. deVilliers, Jr. The agreement is a "double trigger" agreement that will pay benefits to Mr. deVilliers, under certain circumstances, if he is terminated following a change-in-control of the Company or a sale of a particular business unit. Mr. deVilliers' agreement provides that if he is terminated within 24 months following a change-in-control or a sale of his business unit other than for "cause" or if he resigns following such event for "good reason," the benefits under his Management Security Plan shall become fully vested and the present value of such benefits shall be paid to him. In addition, Mr. deVilliers will become fully vested in his stock options and restricted stock.
For this purpose, cause is generally defined as (i) conviction for commission of a felony, (ii) willful misconduct or gross negligence or material violation of policy resulting in material harm to his employer, (iii) repeated and continued failure by the executive to carry out, in all material respects, the employer's reasonable and lawful directions, or (iv) fraud, embezzlement, theft or material dishonesty. Good reason is generally defined as (i) a material reduction in compensation or benefits, (ii) a requirement that the executive relocate, or (iii) any material diminution in the executive's duties, responsibilities, reporting obligations, title or authority.
