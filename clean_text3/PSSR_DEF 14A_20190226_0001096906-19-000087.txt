(the "Company") for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at 12:00 p.m., local time, on April 9, 2019, at One Landmark Square, Stamford, Connecticut, 06901, and at any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) of the Annual Meeting. Distribution of this Proxy Statement         and the enclosed proxy card to shareholders is scheduled to begin on or about March 19, 2019.
Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the owner thereof is present in person or by         proxy. All properly executed and unrevoked proxies in the accompanying form that are received in time for the Annual Meeting will be voted at the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in accordance with any specification         thereon, or if no specification is made, such proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of the named Director nominees, "FOR" the approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and "FOR" the ratification of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's         independent registered public accountants. The Board of Directors knows of no other matters which may be brought before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters are properly presented for action, it is the intention of the named proxies to         vote on them according to their best judgment. Any person giving a proxy may revoke it by written notice to the Company, or by delivering a valid, later-dated proxy in a timely manner, at any time prior to the exercise of the         proxy. In addition, although mere attendance at the Annual Meeting will not revoke the proxy, a person present at the Annual Meeting may withdraw his or her proxy and vote in person. If you hold shares in street name, you must contact the firm that         holds your shares to change or revoke any prior voting instructions. Rights of appraisal or similar rights of dissenters are not available to shareholders of the Company with respect to any matter to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. The Company         will bear the entire cost of the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting.
The Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, as         filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and including the financial statements of the Company, is enclosed herewith.
The mailing address of the principal executive office of the Company is One Landmark Square, Suite 1900,         Stamford, Connecticut, 06901. This Proxy Statement, the accompanying form of proxy and the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 are expected to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company on or about         March 19, 2019.
VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTE REQUIRED
The Company's only class of voting securities outstanding is its common stock, par value $0.01 per share         (the "Common Stock"). On February 26, 2019, the record date for determination of persons entitled to receive notice and vote at the Annual Meeting, there         were 7,696,091 shares of Common Stock outstanding. At the Annual Meeting, each shareholder of record at the close of business on February 26, 2019, will be         entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock owned on that date as to each matter properly presented at the Annual Meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of at least one-third of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of         February 26, 2019 is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Assuming the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting, the affirmative vote         of a plurality of the votes cast by holders of shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote is required for the election of the Company's Directors. The affirmative vote of a majority of the         votes cast by holders of shares of Common Stock present in person, or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to vote, is required (i) for approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and (ii) to ratify the appointment of BDO USA,         LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. An abstention with respect to any proposal will be counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. In the event of a "broker non-vote" (shares held by a         broker or nominee that does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter and has not received voting instructions from its client) with respect to any proposal coming before the meeting caused by the beneficial owner's failure to         authorize a vote on such proposal, the proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum. Under New York law, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and therefore will         have no effect. Please note that brokers may no longer use discretionary authority to vote shares on the election of directors if they have not received instructions from their clients. If your shares are held in "street names," whether through a         broker, bank or other nominee, only they can sign a proxy card with respect to your shares. You are, therefore, urged to contact the person responsible for your account and give them instructions for how to complete a proxy card representing your         shares so that it can be timely returned on your behalf. Please vote your proxy so your vote can be counted. An automated system administered by the Company's transfer agent will be used to tabulate the proxies. I.  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The election of each of the named nominees as a director of the Company requires the affirmative vote of a         plurality of the votes cast by holders of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Unless otherwise directed,         the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy intend to vote at the Annual Meeting "FOR" the election of the nominees named below as Directors of the Company, to serve until the next Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected         and qualified. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE BOARD'S TEN NOMINEES.
If any nominee is unable to stand for election when the election takes place, the shares represented by valid         proxies will be voted in favor of the remaining nominees and for such person, if any, as shall be designated by the present Board of Directors to replace such nominee. The Board of Directors does not presently anticipate that any nominee will be         unable to stand for election.

The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing our financial statements and expressing an opinion that the financial         statements are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial         statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments,         and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.

The Company and the Audit Committee have received the written disclosures and the letter from the         independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the         independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope         and plans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examinations and the overall quality of the Company's financial         reporting. The Audit Committee held five meetings during fiscal year 2018.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors         (and the Board of Directors has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee         and the Board of Directors have also recommended, subject to shareholder approval, the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The foregoing Audit Committee           Report does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, except to the           extent the Company specifically incorporates this Audit Committee Report by reference therein.

* Mr. Cook did not participate in these recommendations or sign this report because he was not a member of the Audit Committee         during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. Compensation Committee
Members: Mr. Ekert, Mr. Stafford, Mr.           Rose, Mr. Schumaecker and Mr. Thomas.  Mr. Thomas was           appointed to the Compensation Committee effective February 26, 2019.
The Compensation Committee determines salaries, bonuses, and incentive compensation for the Company's executive         officers and has authority to recommend awards of stock options, stock bonuses, and other equity-based compensation to executives, employees, and consultants under the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), as amended in fiscal years         2017, 2011 and 2010. The Compensation Committee also determines compensation levels and performs such other functions regarding compensation as the Board of Directors may delegate. The Members of the Compensation Committee have been appointed by         the Board of Directors. Although the Company is not listed on NASDAQ, all of the Compensation Committee Members meet the independence requirements of the applicable NASDAQ listing standards. The Compensation Committee did not hold any formal         separate committee meetings during fiscal year 2018. However, during fiscal year 2018, informal discussions with one or more of the Compensation Committee members were held and any actions taken as a result of those discussions were subsequently         approved by the Board of Directors. From time to time, the Compensation Committee also acts by unanimous consent and, during fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee did not act by unanimous consent. Mr. Ekert has been Chairman of the         Compensation Committee since February 24, 2015.
The Company did not employ a compensation consultant during fiscal year 2018.
The Board of Directors has adopted a Charter to set forth the Compensations Committee's responsibilities. The         Compensation Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at www.passur.com.
Executive Committee
Members: Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Graziani, Mr. Barry, and Mr. Ekert
The Executive Committee was established in October 1998. The Executive Committee's primary function is to assist management in         formulating the Company's strategy and to perform such other duties as may be designated by the Board of Directors. The Executive Committee held four meetings         during fiscal year 2018. Mr. Gilbert has been Chairman of the Executive Committee since February 24, 2015.
Technology Advisory Committee
Members: Mr. Rose, Mr. Barry, Mr. Graziani, and Mr. Haver
The Technology Advisory Committee was established in October 2010. The Committee's primary function is to advise the Company         on technology issues that may affect the Company in the future and develop strategies to address these issues. The Technology Advisory Committee reports to the Board of Directors periodically. The Technology Advisory           Committee held two meetings during fiscal year 2018.         Mr. Rose has been Chairman of the Technology Advisory Committee since April 5, 2017.
Nominating Committee
The Board of Directors does not believe that a separate nominating committee is necessary to ensure proper         evaluation of candidates, given the size of the Company. Currently, the Board of Directors performs the functions typical of a nominating         committee, including the identification, recruitment, and selection of nominees for election as Directors of the Company. Although the Company is not listed on NASDAQ, Director nominees are evaluated by the Company's Directors who meet the         independence requirements of the NASDAQ listing standards. In selecting nominees for the Board of Directors, the Company seeks to identify individuals who have the business background and experience, industry specific knowledge and general         reputation, and expertise that would allow them to contribute as effective Directors to the Company's governance, and who are willing to serve as Directors of a public company. The Board of Directors has no formal policy on         the consideration to be given to diversity in the nomination process, other than to seek candidates who have skills and experience that are appropriate to the position and complementary to those of the other Board members or candidates using the         criteria identified above. The Company does not have a specific policy on shareholder-recommended director candidates. The Board of Directors         believes it is appropriate for the Company not to have such a policy because it prefers to identify and evaluate potential candidates on a case-by-case basis. However, the Board of Directors will consider director nominations made by shareholders.         The Board of Directors' process for evaluating directors nominated by shareholders is the same as the process for evaluating any other director nominees. Shareholders wishing to submit director nominee recommendations for the 2020 Annual Meeting of         Shareholders should submit such nominee recommendations via registered, certified, or express mail to the Corporate Secretary, Louis J. Petrucelly, PASSUR Aerospace, Inc., One Landmark Square, Suite 1900, Stamford, Connecticut, 06901, by November         22, 2019. Any such shareholder must meet the minimum eligibility requirements specified in Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 and must submit, within the same time frame for submitting a shareholder proposal required by Rule 14a-8(e): (1) evidence in         accordance with Rule 14a-8(e) of compliance with the shareholder eligibility requirements; (2) the written consent of the candidate(s) for nomination as a director; (3) a resume or other written statement of the qualifications of the candidate(s)         for nomination as a director; and (4) all information regarding the candidate(s) and the shareholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement filed with the SEC if the candidate(s) were nominated for election to the Board of         Directors.
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all officers, Directors, and         employees regarding their obligations in the conduct of Company affairs. The Company's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on the Company's website at www.passur.com.
Shareholder Communications
Our shareholders may communicate directly with the members of the Board of Directors or the individual chairperson         of standing Board committees by writing to those individuals at the following address: PASSUR Aerospace, Inc., One Landmark Square, Suite 1900, Stamford, Connecticut, 06901. The Company's general policy is to forward, and not intentionally screen,         any mail received at the Company's corporate office that is sent directly to an individual unless the Company believes the communication may pose a security risk.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
The positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer are         currently held by different persons. The Board of Directors believes that having a separate Chairman allows the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Barry, to focus on the day-to-day management of the Company while enabling the Board of Directors to         maintain an independent perspective on the activities of the Company and executive management.
The Company's senior management manages the day-to-day risks facing the Company under the         oversight and supervision of the Board of Directors, which oversees the Company's risk management strategy, focusing on the adequacy of the Company's risk management and mitigation processes. The Board of Directors' role in the risk oversight         process includes receiving regular reports from senior management on areas of material risk, including operations, financial, legal, regulatory, strategic, and reputational risks. The full Board receives these reports to enable it to understand the         Company's risk identification, risk management, and risk mitigation strategies. While the full Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at the Company, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight         responsibilities with respect to risk in the areas of financial reporting and internal controls. In performing its functions, the Audit Committee has access to management and is able to engage advisors, if deemed necessary. The Board of Directors         receives regular reports from the Audit Committee regarding its areas of focus.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the current members of the Compensation Committee is an officer or employee of the Company or its         subsidiary. During fiscal year 2018, none of the Company's executive officers served as a director or member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, whose executive officers served as a         Director or member of our Compensation Committee. No interlocking relationship, as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, exists between the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation Committee, and the board of directors or         compensation committee of any other company. Executive Officers
The Company's named executive officers are Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Barry, Mr. Petrucelly and Mr. Campbell. For         information with respect to Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Barry, who are also Directors, see "Election of Directors – Information Concerning Directors and Nominees."
Louis J. Petrucelly, age 44, joined the Company as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and         Secretary in October 2016. Mr. Petrucelly has more than 15 years of experience in multi-dimensional corporate finance, operations, and accounting. Previously, Mr. Petrucelly spent almost 10 years at FalconStor Software, Inc., a leading         software-defined storage data services company, serving most recently as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer since August 2012. Mr. Petrucelly joined FalconStor Software, Inc. in March 2007 and held several senior         financial positions. Prior to FalconStor Software, Inc., Mr. Petrucelly spent time in senior financial positions at both Granite Broadcasting Corporation and PASSUR Aerospace, Inc. He began his career with Ernst & Young, LLP. Mr. Petrucelly         received his B.S. from the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University.
Timothy P. Campbell, age 56, was named Chief Operating Officer in October 2017. Before joining PASSUR, Mr.         Campbell was most recently Senior Vice President, Air Operations for American Airlines Group. Mr. Campbell led the effort to combine American's Integrated Operations Control (IOC) and US Airways Operations Control Center (OCC). The integration work         also included flight and inflight teams, crew resources, operations planning and performance engineering functions. Over his 30 years in the aviation industry, Mr. Campbell has acquired a diverse set of skills and experience, both in the airline         and aerospace manufacturing spaces.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES OF OUR EXECUTIVE         COMPENSATION PROGRAM
The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting and monitoring the effectiveness of the compensation         provided to the Company's named executive officers. In its decision-making, the Compensation Committee is guided by a compensation philosophy designed to reward named executive officers for the achievement of business goals and the maximization of         shareholder returns. Specific levels of pay and incentive opportunity are determined by the competitive market for executive talent and, where appropriate, the need to invest in the future growth of the business. The compensation program, which         provides incentives for named executive officers to achieve the short-term and long-term goals of the Company, comprises four key components: base salary, annual bonus awards, stock option awards, and benefits.
Base           Salary – Actual salaries are based on individual performance contributions within a tiered salary range for each position that is established through job evaluation and competitive comparisons.
Annual           Bonus Awards – The Company does not have a formal bonus program for its named executive officers. Bonus awards for named executives are determined by the Compensation Committee on a case-by-case basis and based on Company performance.
Stock           Option Awards – The Compensation Committee strongly believes that by providing named executive officers an opportunity to own shares of the Company's Common Stock, the best interests of shareholders and executives will be closely aligned.         The number of outstanding stock options held by our named executive officers as of October 31, 2018, is disclosed in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2018" table.
Benefits         – Executive officers are eligible to participate in benefit programs designed for all full-time employees of the Company. These programs include a 401(k) plan, medical, dental, vision, group life, disability, and accidental death and dismemberment         insurance. The Chief Executive Officer is provided with a vehicle for business and personal use.
Analysis of Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Decisions
The Compensation Committee determines eligibility for annual salary increases and bonus awards for the Company's         named executives, which are not determined pursuant to a specific formula but are based upon its evaluation of overall performance, compensation levels provided to other Company executives, and years of service with the Company. For fiscal years         2018 and 2017, Mr. Barry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, was paid an annual rate of $325,000. The following table sets forth the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the other named         executive officers for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation and on the Frequency of the Advisory Vote on Executive         Compensation
At our 2016 Annual Meeting of shareholders, as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as         amended, we held an advisory vote on our executive compensation, commonly referred to as "say-on-pay."  Over 99% of the shares voted at our 2016 Annual Meeting of shareholders approved our say-on-pay proposal.  As a result of the strong shareholder         support, the Compensation Committee determined not to make any significant changes to our compensation practices for 2018.
At our 2013 Annual Meeting of shareholders, as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as         amended, we held an advisory vote on whether to hold a say-on-pay vote every one, two, or three years, which is commonly referred to as "say-on-frequency." Over 94% of the shares voted at our 2013 Annual Meeting of shareholders approved voting on a         three-year basis. Based on the outcome of that vote, the Company has determined to present a say-on-pay vote in its proxy for the 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to Rule 14a-21(b), promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of         1934, as amended, the Company will present its next say-on-frequency vote in its proxy for the 2022 Annual Meeting of shareholders.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The Company has entered into a loan agreement with G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company's Chairman and significant         stockholder. During fiscal year 2018, the Company paid interest to G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company's significant shareholder and Chairman, of $336,000, representing the entire fiscal year 2018 interest due, thereby meeting the payment         requirements of the loan agreement. During fiscal year 2018, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $2,250,000 to primarily fund the Company's near-term investment strategy to enhance the Company's technology platform, in the form of software         development personnel, third-party contractors, and PASSUR Network infrastructure support. As of October 31, 2018, the loan balance totaled $6,050,000. Subsequent to October 31, 2018, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $910,000. As of         February 28, 2019, the principal amount of the loan outstanding to Mr. Gilbert was $6,960,000. Subsequent to October 31, 2018, the Company paid all interest incurred on the note payable through January 31, 2019 in the amount of $168,000.
During fiscal year 2017, the Company paid to Mr. Gilbert interest of $171,000, representing the entire fiscal year         2017 interest due under the loan agreement, thereby meeting the payment requirements of the loan agreement. During fiscal year 2017, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $1,100,000 to primarily fund the Company's near-term investment         strategy to enhance the Company's technology platform, in the form of software development personnel, third-party contractors, and PASSUR Network infrastructure support. As of October 31, 2017, the loan balance totaled $3,800,000. On January 28, 2019, the Company entered into a Fifth Debt Extension Agreement with Mr. Gilbert, effective January         28, 2019, pursuant to which the Company and Mr. Gilbert agreed to modify certain terms and conditions of the existing debt agreement with Mr. Gilbert (the "Existing Gilbert Note"). The maturity date of the Existing Gilbert Note was due on November         1, 2019, and the total amount of principal and first quarter of fiscal year 2019 interest due and owing as of January 28, 2019, was $7,122,000. Pursuant to the Fifth Debt Extension Agreement, the Company issued a new note to Mr. Gilbert in the         principal amount of $6,960,000 (the "Fifth Replacement Note") in exchange for the Existing Gilbert Note and the Company agreed to pay the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 accrued interest under the Existing Gilbert Note as of January 28, 2019, in         an amount equal to $162,000, at the time and on the terms set forth in the Existing Gilbert Note. Under the terms of the Fifth Replacement Note, the maturity date was extended to November 1, 2020, and the annual interest rate remained at 9 3/4%.         Interest payments under the Fifth Replacement Note shall be made annually on October 31st of each year. The note payable is secured by the Company's assets.
The Company has received a commitment from G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, dated January 29, 2019, that if the Company, at         any time, is unable to meet its obligations through January 29, 2020, G.S. Beckwith Gilbert will provide the necessary continuing financial support to the Company in order for the Company to meet such obligations. Such commitment for financial         support may be in the form of additional advances or loans to the Company, in addition to the deferral of principal and/or interest payments due on the existing loans, if deemed necessary. The note payable is secured by the Company's assets.
II. ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are providing our shareholders         an opportunity to indicate whether they support our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This advisory vote, commonly referred to as "say on pay," is not intended to address any specific item of compensation,         but instead relates to the tabular disclosures regarding named executive officer compensation, and the narrative disclosure accompanying the tabular presentation. These disclosures allow our shareholders to view the trends in our compensation         program and the application of our compensation philosophies for the years presented.
The Compensation Committee believes an effective compensation program should be one that is designed to recruit         and keep top quality executive leadership focused on attaining long-term corporate goals and increasing stockholder value. We believe that our executive compensation program is designed to reasonably and fairly recruit, motivate, retain, and reward         our executives for achieving our objectives and goals.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the following         resolution:
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed         in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the summary compensation table and the related compensation tables, footnotes, and narrative disclosures."
Although this vote is advisory and not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee will take into account         the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. To be effective, the proposal needs to be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the         matter.
III. APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
We are asking you to approve the PASSUR Aerospace, Inc., 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which the Board,         subject to shareholder approval and upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, unanimously adopted on February 26, 2019, and ratified by the Compensation Committee on February 28, 2019, to replace the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive         Plan, as amended (the "2009 Plan"), which expired on February 24, 2019. The Plan became effective upon the date of its adoption by the Board, subject to shareholder approval within twelve months of the date of such adoption.
The Plan authorizes the issuance of an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock to directors, employees, and consultants         of the Company and its related companies pursuant to awards under the Plan. There were 1,265,500 unused shares of         Common Stock (i.e., shares that were not subject to outstanding awards) available under the 2009 Plan at the time of its expiration. Therefore, the new Plan will only authorize the issuance of an additional 3,734,500 shares of Common Stock, when compared to the number of shares that were available         immediately prior to the expiration of the 2009 Plan. The Board believes that the Plan is necessary for the Company to attract and retain highly competent individuals         upon whose judgment, initiative and leadership the future success of the Company will, in a large measure, depend. The Plan reflects the Company's view that in today's employment environment it is critical to have the flexibility to offer         attractive, equity-based compensation packages in order to recruit and retain qualified directors, employees, and consultants.
SUMMARY OF THE PLAN
Below is a summary of the principal features of the Plan. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by         the specific language of the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
ADMINISTRATION. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee or such other committee of directors         as the Board may designate from time to time (for the purposes of this discussion, the "Committee"), except with respect to awards made to non-employee directors of the Company ("Outside Directors"). The Plan will be administered by the full Board         with respect to awards to Outside Directors. (References in this proposal to the Committee in the context of awards to Outside Directors shall be deemed to be to the Board). The Committee will have full power and authority to grant awards under the         Plan and to interpret and administer the Plan.
ELIGIBILITY & TYPES OF AWARDS. Approximately                70 directors, employees, and consultants of the Company and its related companies are eligible to receive awards under the Plan. Awards granted         under the Plan may be made in the form of: stock options, including incentive stock options ("ISOs") within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs"), stock         appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, deferred stock, and bonus stock. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Company or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations.
AGGREGATE SHARE LIMITATION. The total number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to the Plan is 5,000,000         (such number, as well as the individual share limitations below, are subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar recapitalization events specified in the Plan), all of which may be issued pursuant to ISOs. Such         shares may consist of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. The exercise of an SAR for cash or the payment of any other award in cash shall not count against this limit. To the extent a stock option or SAR terminates without having         been exercised, or an award terminates without the holder having received payment of the award, or shares are forfeited, such shares subject shall again be available for issuance in connection with future awards under the Plan. At the close of trading on February 26,         2019, the closing price of a share of the Company's Common Stock was $1.55.
INDIVIDUAL SHARE LIMITATIONS. No employee may be granted stock options or SARs under the Plan with respect to more than         500,000 shares of Common Stock in any fiscal year. No employee may be granted performance awards (described below) under the Plan (other than stock options or SARs) with respect to more than 500,000 shares of Common Stock in any fiscal year. The         aggregate fair market value of Common Stock (determined as of the date of grant) with respect to which ISOs granted under the Plan and all other option         plans of the Company and its related companies that become exercisable for the first time by the employee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000.
STOCK OPTIONS. Stock options awarded under the Plan shall be in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the         Committee may determine. The exercise price per share of Common Stock shall be determined by the Committee, but may not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant unless such stock option complies with the         requirements of Section 409A of the Code and only with respect to a NQSO. Unless determined by the Committee, the term of each stock option shall be ten years from the date of grant, except that no ISOs granted to an employee owning more than 10%         of the total combined voting power of the Company and its related companies shall be exercisable more than five years after the date of grant. Stock options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms as shall be determined         by the Committee. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, all options shall fully vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant. In the event of an employee's termination of employment or other service with the Company, any outstanding options,         to the extent then vested, must be exercised upon termination within 30 days of the termination date, unless otherwise provided by the Committee. In no event can           the Committee (A) lower the exercise price per share purchasable under a stock option after the grant of such stock option, (B) when the exercise price per share purchasable under a stock option exceeds the fair market value of a share of Common           Stock, cancel such stock option in exchange for another award (other than in connection with substitute awards) or offer to purchase such stock option for a payment, in cash, in substitution for or upon cancellation of such stock option or (C)           take any other action with respect to a stock option that may be treated as a repricing pursuant to applicable NASDAQ rules, without shareholder approval. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. A SAR         shall entitle the holder thereof to receive payment of an amount, in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee, equal in value to the excess of the fair market value of the number of shares of Common         Stock as to which the award is granted on the date of exercise over an amount, which may not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the award, specified by the Committee. Any such award shall be in such form and shall         have such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.
RESTRICTED STOCK. The Committee may award restricted shares of Common Stock under the Plan to eligible persons, in such form and on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine. Each       restricted stock award shall specify the number of shares of restricted stock to be awarded, the price, if any, to be paid by the recipient and the date or dates on which, or the conditions upon the satisfaction of which, the restricted stock will       vest. The grant and/or the vesting of restricted stock may be conditioned upon the completion of a specified period of service with the Company or a related company, upon the attainment of specified performance objectives or upon such other criteria       as the Committee may determine. Except as may be permitted by the Committee, no share of restricted stock may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the recipient until such share has vested in accordance with the terms of       the restricted stock award. The Committee may provide that a recipient shall have the right to vote or receive dividends on restricted stock. Except as may       be provided by the Committee, in the event of a recipient's termination of employment or other service before all of his or her restricted stock has vested, or in the event any conditions to the vesting of restricted stock have not been satisfied       prior to any deadline for the satisfaction of such conditions set forth in the award, the shares of restricted stock which have not vested shall be forfeited.
DEFERRED STOCK. The Committee may award deferred stock under the Plan to eligible persons, in such form and on         such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine. Each deferred stock award shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the award and the duration of the period during which, and the conditions under which, receipt of the         Common Stock will be deferred. The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of deferred stock, or receipt of Common Stock or cash at the end of the deferral period, upon the attainment of specified performance objectives or such other criteria         as the Committee may determine. Except as may be provided by the Committee, deferred stock awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered during the deferral period. At the expiration of the deferral period, the         recipient shall receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares covered by the deferred stock award, cash equal to the fair market value of such Stock, or a combination of shares and cash, as the         Committee may determine. In the event of a recipient's termination of employment or other service before the deferred stock has vested, his or her deferred stock shall be forfeited.
BONUS STOCK. The Committee may award bonus stock under the Plan to eligible persons, subject to such terms and         conditions as the Committee shall determine. No person who is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such an award. The grant of bonus stock may be conditioned upon the attainment         of specified performance objectives or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine and shall be satisfied by the delivery of the designated number of shares of Common Stock which are not subject to restriction.
PERFORMANCE AWARDS. The Committee may designate awards as performance awards. The grant or vesting of a         performance award shall be subject to the achievement of performance objectives established by the Committee based on one or more of the following criteria: sales, operating profits, operating profits before interest expense and taxes, net         earnings, earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, cash flow, debt to equity ratio, market share, stock price, economic value added, and market value added.
CHANGE OF CONTROL. In the event of a Change of Control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), to the extent provided in an       agreement between the holder and the Company or its related companies or otherwise determined by the Committee, without any requirement that each holder be treated consistently, (i) outstanding options and SARs may become fully exercisable and       vested; (ii) the restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any outstanding restricted stock and deferred stock awards may lapse and such shares and awards may be deemed fully vested; and (iii) the Committee may, in its discretion, cancel       any outstanding awards and pay the holders, in cash, the value of such awards based on the highest price per share of Common Stock received or to be received by shareholders of the Company in connection with the Change in Control.
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. The Board may discontinue the Plan at any time and may amend it from time to time. No         amendment or discontinuation of the Plan shall adversely affect any award previously granted without the award holder's written consent. Amendments may be made without shareholder approval except as required to satisfy applicable law or exchange         requirements, including Section 422 of the Code.
EXPIRATION DATE.  Unless earlier terminated, the Plan will expire on February 25, 2029. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The Plan             is not qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code and is not subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Nonqualified Stock Options.
An             optionee generally is not taxable upon the grant of a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan.  On exercise of a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan, an optionee will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess, if any,             of the fair market value on the date of exercise of the Shares acquired on exercise of the option over the exercise price. If the optionee is an employee of us or any subsidiary, that income will be subject to the withholding of Federal income             tax.  The optionee's tax basis in those Shares will be equal to their fair market value on the date of exercise of the option, and his or her holding period for those Shares will begin on that date.
If an             optionee pays for Shares on exercise of an option by delivering Shares, the optionee will not recognize gain or loss on the Shares delivered, even if their fair market value at the time of exercise differs from the optionee's tax basis in             them.  The optionee, however, otherwise will be taxed on the exercise of the option in the manner described above as if he or she had paid the exercise price in cash.  If a separate identifiable stock certificate or other indicia of ownership             is issued for that number of Shares equal to the number of Shares delivered on exercise of the option, the optionee's tax basis in the Shares represented by that certificate or other indicia of ownership will be equal to his or her tax basis in             the Shares delivered, and his or her holding period for those Shares will include his or her holding period for the Shares delivered.  The optionee's tax basis and holding period for the additional Shares received on exercise of the option will             be the same as if the optionee had exercised the option solely in exchange for cash.
We             generally will be entitled to a deduction for Federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the optionee, provided that amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense for us and is reasonable in             amount, and either the employee includes that amount in income or we timely satisfy our reporting requirements with respect             to that amount.
Incentive Stock Options.
Under the             Code, an optionee generally is not subject to tax upon the grant or exercise of an ISO.  In addition, if the optionee holds a Share received on exercise of an ISO for at least two years from the date the option was granted and at least one year             from the date the option was exercised, which we refer to as the Required Holding Period, the difference, if any, between the amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of that Share and the holder's tax basis in that Share will be             long-term capital gain or loss.
If an             optionee disposes of a Share acquired on exercise of an ISO before the end of the Required Holding Period, which we refer to as a Disqualifying Disposition, the optionee generally will recognize ordinary income in the year of the Disqualifying             Disposition equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Share on the date the ISO was exercised over the exercise price.  If, however, the Disqualifying Disposition is a sale or exchange on which a loss, if realized, would be             recognized for Federal income tax purposes, and if the sales proceeds are less than the fair market value of the Share on the date of exercise of the option, the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee will not exceed the gain, if             any, realized on the sale.  If the amount realized on a Disqualifying Disposition exceeds the fair market value of the Share on the date of exercise of the option, that excess will be short-term or long-term capital gain, depending on whether             the holding period for the Share exceeds one year.
An             optionee who exercises an ISO by delivering Shares acquired previously pursuant to the exercise of an ISO before the expiration of the Required Holding Period for those Shares is treated as making a Disqualifying Disposition of those Shares.              This rule prevents "pyramiding" or the exercise of an ISO (that is, exercising an ISO for one Share and using that Share, and others so acquired, to exercise successive ISOs) without the imposition of current income tax. For             purposes of the alternative minimum tax, the amount by which the fair market value of a Share acquired on exercise of an ISO exceeds the exercise price of that option generally will be an adjustment included in the optionee's alternative             minimum taxable income for the year in which the option is exercised.  If, however, there is a Disqualifying Disposition of the Share in the year in which the option is exercised, there will be no adjustment with respect to that Share.  If             there is a Disqualifying Disposition in a later year, no income with respect to the Disqualifying Disposition is included in the optionee's alternative minimum taxable income for that year.  In computing alternative minimum taxable income, the             tax basis of a Share acquired on exercise of an ISO is increased by the amount of the adjustment taken into account with respect to that Share for alternative minimum tax purposes in the year the option is exercised.
We are             not allowed an income tax deduction with respect to the grant or exercise of an ISO or the disposition of a Share acquired on exercise of an ISO after the Required Holding Period.  However, if there is a Disqualifying Disposition of a Share, we             generally are allowed a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income includible in income by the optionee, provided that amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense for us and is reasonable in amount, and either the             employee includes that amount in income or we timely satisfy our reporting requirements with respect to that amount.
Stock Awards.
Generally,                  the recipient of a stock award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the Shares are received equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares received over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for             the Shares.  If, however, the Shares are not vested when they are received under the Plan (for example, if the recipient is required to work for a period of time in order to have the right to sell the Shares), the recipient generally will not             recognize income until the Shares become vested, at which time the recipient will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date they become vested over any amount paid by             the recipient in exchange for the Shares.  A recipient may, however, file an election with the Internal Revenue Service, within 30 days of his or her receipt of the Award, to recognize ordinary compensation income, as of the date the recipient             receives the Award, equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date the Award is granted over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the Shares.
The             recipient's basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of Shares acquired as Awards will be the amount paid for the Shares plus any ordinary income recognized either when the Shares are received or when the             Shares become vested.  Upon the disposition of any Shares received as a Share Award under the Plan, the difference between the sales price and the recipient's basis in the Shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss and generally will be             characterized as long-term capital gain or loss if the Shares have been held for more the one year from the date as of which he or she would be required to recognize any compensation income.
We             generally will be entitled to a deduction for Federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the recipient, provided that amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense for us, is reasonable in             amount, and is not precluded by the deduction limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code, and either the recipient includes that amount in income or we timely satisfy our reporting requirements with respect to that amount.
Stock Appreciation Rights.
We may             grant stock appreciation rights, separate from any other Award, which we refer to as Stand-Alone stock appreciation rights, or Tandem stock appreciation rights, under the Plan.  Generally, the recipient of a Stand-Alone stock appreciation right             will not recognize any taxable income at the time the Stand-Alone stock appreciation right is granted.
With             respect to Stand-Alone stock appreciation rights, if the recipient receives the appreciation inherent in the stock appreciation rights in cash, the cash will be taxable as ordinary compensation income to the recipient at the time that the cash             is received.  If the recipient receives the appreciation inherent in the stock appreciation rights in Shares, the recipient will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Shares on the day they             are received over any amounts paid by the recipient for the Shares. With             respect to Tandem stock appreciation rights, if the recipient elects to surrender the underlying option in exchange for cash or Shares equal to the appreciation inherent in the underlying option, the tax consequences to the recipient will be             the same as discussed above relating to the Stand-Alone stock appreciation rights.  If the recipient elects to exercise the underlying option, the holder will be taxed at the time of exercise as if he or she had exercised a nonqualified stock             option (discussed above), i.e., the recipient will recognize ordinary income for Federal tax purposes measured by the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares over the exercise price.
In             general, there will be no Federal income tax deduction allowed to us upon the grant or termination of Stand-Alone stock appreciation rights or Tandem stock appreciation rights.  Upon the exercise of either a Stand-Alone stock appreciation right             or a Tandem stock appreciation right, however, we generally will be entitled to a deduction for Federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that the employee is required to recognize as a result of the exercise, provided             that the deduction is not otherwise disallowed under the Code.
Dividend Equivalents.
Generally,                  the recipient of a dividend equivalent award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the dividend equivalent award is received equal to the fair market value of the amount received.  We generally will be entitled to a deduction             for Federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that the recipient is required to recognize as a result of the dividend equivalent award, provided that the deduction is not otherwise disallowed under the Code.
Section 162 Limitations.
Section 162(m) of the Code denies a publicly held corporation a deduction for U.S. federal           income tax purposes for compensation in excess of $1 million per year per person to certain of its executive officers. Beginning January 1, 2018, with the passage and signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this limitation will apply to the           Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Company's other named executive officers, and anyone who was a covered person after December 31, 2016.
Section 409A of the Code
The Plan is             intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code to the extent that such section would apply to any Award under the Plan. Section 409A of the Code governs the taxation of deferred compensation. Any participant that is granted an Award that is             deemed to be deferred compensation, such as a grant of restricted stock units that does not qualify for an exemption from Section 409A of the Code, and does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, could be subject to taxation on the Award as             soon as the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (even if the Award is not exercisable) and an additional 20% tax (and a further additional tax based upon an amount of interest determined under Section 409A of the             Code) on the value of the Award.
Importance of Consulting Tax Adviser.
The             information set forth above is a summary only and does not purport to be complete.  In addition, the information is based upon current Federal income tax rules and therefore is subject to change when those rules change.  Moreover, because the             tax consequences to any recipient may depend on his or her particular situation, each recipient should consult his or her tax adviser as to the Federal, state, local, foreign and other tax consequences of the grant or exercise of an Award or             the disposition of Shares acquired as a result of an Award.
NEW PLAN BENEFITS
Because awards to be granted in the future under the Plan are at the discretion of the Committee, it is not         possible to determine the benefits or the amounts received or that will be received under the Plan by our officers or other employees.
Approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast         by holders of shares of Common Stock present in person, or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to vote. Abstentions and non-broker votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Unless otherwise directed, the persons named         in the accompanying form of proxy intend to vote at the Annual Meeting "FOR" the approval of the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. THE BOARD OF           DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN. V. RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM'S APPOINTMENT
The Audit Committee has appointed BDO USA, LLP, to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the         fiscal year ending October 31, 2019, subject to the ratification of such appointment by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. Such firm has no financial interest, either direct or indirect, in the Company. The Board of Directors anticipate that         representatives from BDO USA, LLP, will attend the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented at the meeting and entitled to vote         is required to ratify the appointment of BDO USA, LLP, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment and retention of the Company's independent registered         public-accounting firm. Although ratification by shareholders is not required by the Company's organizational documents or other applicable law, the Audit Committee has determined that requesting the shareholders to ratify the selection of BDO USA,         LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is a matter of good corporate practice. If shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain BDO USA, LLP, but may still retain         them. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Audit and Audit Related Fees
The aggregate fees billed to the Company for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, by         the Company's independent registered public-accountants, BDO USA, LLP, are as follows:

 Total     $   273,746       $   255,721    
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees:
Fees billed to the Company by BDO USA, LLP, relate to the services rendered for (i) the audit of the Company's         annual financial statements set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and (ii) the review of the Company's quarterly financial statements set forth in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for fiscal years ended October 31, 2018,         and 2017, respectively. In addition, fees billed related to the review of the Company's S-8 filings during both 2018 and 2017 are also included.
Audit Related Fees:
There were no audit related fees billed to the Company by BDO USA, LLP, during fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
Tax Fees:
Tax fees billed to the Company for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are comprised of fees for preparing federal and         state tax returns and related tax compliance matters. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit fees for services is compatible with maintaining BDO USA, LLP's independence.
All Other Fees:
There were no other fees paid to BDO USA, LLP in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for         appointing, setting the compensation for, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to review and pre-approve all audit and         permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services.
Prior to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee will pre-approve all         auditing services and all permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof), except those not requiring pre-approval based upon the de minimus exception set forth in Section 202(i)(1)(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to be         performed by the registered public accounting firm, to the extent required by law, according to established procedures. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more Audit Committee members the authority to grant pre-approvals for audit and         permitted non-audit services to be performed by the registered public accounting firm, provided that the decisions of such members to grant pre-approvals will be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
All of the services provided by BDO USA, LLP, as described above were approved by the Company's Audit Committee.
Abstentions and non-broker votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Unless         otherwise directed, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy intend to vote at the Annual Meeting "FOR" ratification of BDO USA, LLP, as the Company's independent registered public accountants. THE BOARD           OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF BDO USA, LLP, AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.
The Board of Directors knows of no other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting.         However, if any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons appointed in the accompanying proxy intend to vote the shares represented thereby in accordance with their best judgment.
PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8, shareholder proposals intended for inclusion in our fiscal year         2019 proxy statement and to be acted upon at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting"), must be received by us at our executive offices at One Landmark Square, Suite 1900, Stamford, Connecticut 06901, Attention: Corporate         Secretary, on or prior to November 22, 2019.
Rule 14a-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, governs our use of discretionary proxy         voting authority with respect to a shareholder proposal that is not addressed in the proxy statement. With respect to our Annual Meeting of shareholders to be held in 2020, if we are not provided notice of a shareholder proposal prior to February 6, 2020, we will be permitted to use our discretionary voting authority when the proposal is raised at the meeting, without any discussion of the         matter in the proxy statement.
ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND FORM 10-K
The fiscal year 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (which is not a part of our proxy soliciting         materials), including the financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, is being mailed with this proxy statement to those shareholders who also received a copy of the proxy materials in the mail. The Notice of Annual Meeting of         Shareholders, this proxy statement, and our fiscal year 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits filed with it, are also available at our website at http://www.passur.com/who-we-are-investors-sec-filings.htm. Upon request by any shareholder         to our Corporate Secretary at the address listed above, we will furnish a copy of our fiscal year 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K without charge, and copies of any or all exhibits to the fiscal year 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a charge of         $50.
DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS TO HOUSEHOLDS
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery         requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as         "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies.
We and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single proxy statement and annual         report to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address,         householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, or if you are         receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and annual report and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you are a shareholder of record. You can notify us by sending a         written request by mail to Corporate Secretary, Louis J. Petrucelly, PASSUR Aerospace, Inc., One Landmark Square, Suite 1900, Stamford, Connecticut, 06901, or by calling (203) 622-4086. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral         request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the annual report and proxy statement to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. APPENDIX A
PASSUR AEROSPACE, INC.
2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
Section 1.
PURPOSES
The purposes of the PASSUR Aerospace, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") are to           enable PASSUR Aerospace, Inc., a New York corporation (the "Company") and its Related Companies (as defined below) to attract, retain, and reward directors, employees and consultants of the Company and its Related Companies ("Eligible Persons")           and strengthen the existing mutuality of interests between such persons and the Company's shareholders by offering such persons equity interests in the Company.  For purposes of the Plan, a "Related Company" means any corporation, partnership,           joint venture or other entity in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, at least a 50.1% beneficial ownership interest.
Section 2.

If two Awards are granted in tandem                        to an Eligible Person, the Eligible Person may exercise (or otherwise receive the benefit of) one Award only to the extent he or she relinquishes the tandem Award.  
[END TABLE]
Section             3.ADMINISTRATION
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.1  The Plan shall be administered by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") or such committee of directors as the Board shall designate (the                        "Committee"), which shall consist of not less than two directors each of whom is a non-employee director, as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or any                        successor rule.  The members of the Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.  
  3.2  The Committee shall have full authority and power, except with respect to Awards to Outside Directors (as defined below), to grant Awards, to                        interpret the Plan and to make such rules and regulations and establish such practices and procedures as it deems appropriate for the administration of the Plan.  In particular, and without limiting its authority and powers, except                        with respect to Awards to Outside Directors, the Committee shall have the authority and power, subject to the Plan and applicable law and exchange requirements, to determine:  
  (a)  whether and to what extent any Award or combination of Awards will be granted hereunder, including whether any Awards will be granted in tandem with                        each other;  
  (b)  the Eligible Persons to whom Awards will be granted;  
  (c)  the number of shares of the common stock of the Company (the "Stock") to be covered by each Award granted hereunder subject to the limitations                        contained herein;  
  (d)  the terms and conditions of any Award granted hereunder, including, but not limited to, any vesting or other restrictions based solely on such                        performance objectives (the "Performance Objectives");  
  (e)  the treatment of Awards upon an Eligible Person's retirement, disability, death, termination for cause or other termination of employment or other                        service;  
  (f)  the fair market value of the Stock on a given date pursuant to a formula or otherwise; provided, however, that if the Committee fails to make a                        determination, fair market value of the Stock on a given date shall be the closing sale price on a given date, or if no such sale of Stock occurs on such date, the next preceding date on which a sale occurred;  
  (g)  that an amount of any dividends declared with respect to the number of shares covered by an Award (i) will be paid to the grantee currently or (ii)                        will be deferred and deemed to be reinvested or (iii) will otherwise be credited to the grantee, or that the grantee has no rights with respect to such dividends;  
  (h)  whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances Stock and other amounts payable with respect to an Award will be deferred either automatically                        or at the election of a grantee, including providing for and determining the amount (if any) of deemed earnings on any deferred amount during any deferral period;  
  (i)  whether to amend the terms of any Award, prospectively or retroactively; provided, however, that no amendment shall impair the rights of the Award                        holder without his or her written consent; and  
  (j)  whether to substitute new Stock Options for previously granted Stock Options, or for options granted under other plans or agreements, in each case                        including previously granted options having higher option prices, and the terms and conditions of such new Stock Options.  
[END TABLE]
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not be permitted to (A) lower the exercise           price per share purchasable under an Stock Option after such Stock Option is granted, (B) cancel a Stock Option when the exercise price per Stock share exceeds the fair market value of a share of Stock in exchange for another Award (other than in           connection with  substitute Awards), (C) offer to purchase a Stock Option, at any time when the exercise price per share of Stock exceeds the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock, for a payment in cash in substitution for or upon cancellation of           such Stock Option previously granted, or (D) take any other action with respect to a Stock Option that may be treated as a repricing pursuant to the applicable rules of NASDAQ, without approval of the Company's shareholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.3  The Committee shall have the right to designate Awards as "Performance Awards.".  The grant or vesting of a Performance Award shall be subject to                        the achievement of Performance Objectives established by the Committee based on one or more of the following criteria, in each case applied to the Company on a consolidated basis and/or to a business unit, and which the Committee may                        use as an absolute measure, as a measure of improvement relative to prior performance, or as a measure of comparable performance relative to a peer group of companies; sales, operating profits, operating profits before interest                        expense and taxes, net earnings, earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, cash flow, debt to equity ratio, market share, stock price, economic value added, and                        market value added.  The Performance Objectives for a particular Performance Award relative to a particular fiscal year shall be established by the Committee in writing no later than 150 days after the beginning of such year.  The                        Committee's determination as to the achievement of Performance Objectives relating to a Performance Objective shall be made in writing.  The Committee shall have discretion to modify the Performance Objective or vesting conditions of                        a Performance Award.  
  3.4  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may delegate the Committee's authority and duties under the Plan to the Chief Executive Officer of the                        Company, or to any other employee or committee of employees of the Company, in either case to the extent permitted under applicable law, under such conditions and limitations as the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may from time                        to time establish, except that only the Committee may make any determinations regarding Awards to Eligible Individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or which by law may not be delegated.  
  3.5  All determinations made by the Committee or the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, unless and                        except to the extent that, in the case of determinations by the Committee, the Board shall have previously directed that all or specified types of determinations of the Committee shall be subject to approval by the Board.  
  3.6  Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything else in the Plan to the contrary, the Board shall have sole authority and power to grant Awards under the                        Plan to any Director of the Company who is not also an employee of the Company or a Related Company (an "Outside Director").  With respect to Awards to Outside Directors, (i) the Board shall have sole authority and power to make all                        determinations contemplated by Section 3.2 above; to interpret the Plan; to adopt, amend, and rescind administrative regulations to further the purposes of the Plan; and to take any other action necessary to the proper operation of                        the Plan, and (ii) references herein to the "Committee" shall be deemed to be references to the "Board."  
  3.7  Each Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement between the Company and the recipient of the Award.

 Section             4.STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.1  The total number of shares which may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan shall be 5,000,000 shares of Stock (subject to adjustment                        as provided below), all of which may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options (as defined below).  Such shares may consist of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.  The exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right for cash                        or the payment of any other Award in cash shall not count against this share limit.  
  4.2  To the extent a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right terminates without having been exercised, or an Award terminates without the Award holder                        having received payment of the Award, or shares awarded are forfeited, the shares subject to such Award shall again be available for issuance in connection with future Awards under the Plan.  
  4.3  No employee shall be granted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with respect to more than 500,000 shares of Stock under the Plan in any                        fiscal year (subject to adjustments as provided in Section 4.4). No employee shall be granted Performance Awards (other than Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) with respect to more than 500,000 shares of Stock under the Plan                        in any fiscal year (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4).  
  4.4  In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale of substantially all assets, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split,                        spin-off, split-up, split-off, distribution of assets or other change in corporate structure affecting the Stock, a substitution or adjustment, as may be determined to be appropriate by the Board in its sole discretion, shall be made                        in the aggregate and type number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, the number and type of shares with respect to which Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to any individual in any fiscal year, the                        number and type of shares subject to outstanding Awards and the amounts to be paid by Award holders or the Company, as the case may be, with respect to outstanding Awards; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall increase the                        aggregate value of any outstanding Award.  
[END TABLE]
Section             5.ELIGIBILITY
Each individual who is an Eligible Person may be granted Awards under the Plan.            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to employees of the Company or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Section 424 of the Code. Section             6.STOCK OPTIONS
[BEGIN TABLE]
  6.1  The Stock Options awarded under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code or any                        successor provision thereto; and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options; provided, that Eligible Persons who are not employees of the Company or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Section 424 of the Code may only be                        granted Non-Qualified Stock Options.  To the extent that any Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.  
  6.2  Subject to the following provisions, Stock Options awarded to Eligible Persons under the Plan shall be in such form and shall have such terms and                        conditions as the Committee may determine:  
  (a)  The option price per share of Stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee, and may not be less than the fair market                        value of the Stock on the date of the award of the Stock Option unless such Stock Option complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and solely with respect to a Non-Qualified Stock Option.  
  (b)  Unless determined otherwise by the Committee or set forth in Section 6.3 below, the term of the Stock Option shall be ten years from the date of                        grant, subject to earlier termination in the event of termination of service.  
  (c)  Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms as shall be determined by the Committee.  The Committee may waive                        such exercise provisions or accelerate the exercisability of the Stock Option at any time in whole or in part.  Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, all options shall vest 20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and                        fifth anniversaries of the grant.  
  (d)  Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period by giving written notice of exercise to the Company                        specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment of the purchase price.  Payment of the purchase price shall be made in such manner and on such terms as the Committee may provide in the Award, which may include                        cash (including cash equivalents), delivery of shares of Stock already owned by the optionee or subject to Awards hereunder, "cashless exercise", any other manner permitted by law determined by the Committee, or any combination of the                        foregoing.  If the Committee determines that a Stock Option may be exercised using shares of Restricted Stock, then unless the Committee provides otherwise, a number of the shares received upon such exercise equal to the number of                        shares of restricted Stock so used shall be restricted in accordance with the original terms of the Restricted Stock Award.  
  (e)  An optionee shall not have any rights to dividends nor other rights of a shareholder with respect to shares subject to a Stock Option until the                        optionee has given written notice of exercise and has paid for such shares.  
  (f)  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee solely with respect to Non-Qualified Stock Options, (i) Stock Options shall not be transferable by the                        optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and (ii) during the optionee's lifetime, all Stock Options shall be exercisable only by the optionee or by his or her guardian or legal representative.  
  (g)  Following the termination of an optionee's employment or other service with the Company or a Related Company, the Stock Option, to the extent then                        vested, must be exercised upon termination within 30 days of the termination date, unless otherwise provided by the Committee. The Committee may provide different post-termination exercise provisions with respect to termination for                        different reasons.  
  6.3  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2, no Incentive Stock Option shall (i) have an option price which is less than 100% of the fair market                        value of the Stock on the date of the award of the Incentive Stock Option, (ii) be exercisable more than ten years after the date such Incentive Stock Option is awarded, or (iii) be awarded more than ten years after the Effective Date                        of the Plan specified in Section 16.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Stock Option granted to an employee who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its                        parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Section 424 of the Code, shall (a) have an option price which is less than 110% of the fair market value of the Stock on the date of award of the Incentive Stock Option or (b) be                        exercisable more than five years after the date such Incentive Stock Option is awarded.  
  6.4  The aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date the                          Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan and all other option plans of the Company (and any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as                          those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code, respectively) that become exercisable for the first time by the employee during any calendar year shall not (to the extent required by the Code at the time of the                          grant) exceed $100,000.

 Section             7.STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
[BEGIN TABLE]
  7.1  A Stock Appreciation Right awarded to an Eligible Person shall entitle the holder thereof to receive payment of an amount, in cash, shares of Stock                        or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee, equal in value to the excess of the fair market value of the number of shares of Stock as to which the Award is granted on the date of exercise over an amount, which may not be                        less than the fair market value of the Stock on the date of the award of the Stock Appreciation Right, specified by the Committee.  Any such Award shall be in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the Committee may                        determine.  The grant shall specify the number of shares of Stock as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is granted.  
[END TABLE]
Section             8.RESTRICTED STOCK
Subject to the following provisions, all Awards of Restricted Stock to Eligible Persons shall           be in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  The Restricted Stock Award shall specify the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be awarded, the price, if any, to be paid by the recipient of                        the Restricted Stock and the date or dates on which, or the conditions upon the satisfaction of which, the Restricted Stock will vest.  The grant and/or the vesting of Restricted Stock may be conditioned upon the completion of a                        specified period of service with the Company or a Related Company, upon the attainment of specified Performance Objectives or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine.  
  (b)  Stock certificates representing the Restricted Stock awarded to an Eligible Person shall be registered in the person's name, but the Committee may                        direct that such certificates be held by the Company on behalf of the person.  Except as may be permitted by the Committee, no share of Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the                        recipient until such share has vested in accordance with the terms of the Restricted Stock Award.  At the time Restricted Stock vests, a certificate for such vested shares shall be delivered to the recipient (or his or her designated                        beneficiary in the event of death), free of all restrictions.  
  (c)  The Committee may provide that the Eligible Person shall have the right to vote or receive dividends on Restricted Stock.  Unless the Committee                        provides otherwise, Stock received as a dividend on, or in connection with a stock split of, Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock.  
  (d)  Except as may be provided by the Committee, in the event of a recipient's termination of employment or other service before all of his or her                        Restricted Stock has vested, or in the event any conditions to the vesting of Restricted Stock have not been satisfied prior to any deadline for the satisfaction of such conditions set forth in the Award, the shares of Restricted                        Stock which have not vested shall be forfeited, and the Committee may provide that (i) any purchase price paid by the recipient shall be returned to the recipient or (ii) a cash payment equal to the Restricted Stock's fair market                        value on the date of forfeiture, if lower, shall be paid to the recipient.  
  (e)  The Committee may waive, in whole or in part, any or all of the conditions to receipt of, or restrictions with respect to, any or all of the                        recipient's Restricted Stock.  
[END TABLE]
 Section             9.DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS
Subject to the following provisions, all Awards of Deferred Stock to Eligible Persons shall be           in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  The Deferred Stock Award shall specify the number of shares of Deferred Stock to be awarded to any Eligible Person and the duration of the period                        (the "Deferral Period") during which, and the conditions under which, receipt of the Stock will be deferred.  The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of Deferred Stock, or receipt of Stock or cash at the end of the Deferral                        Period, upon the attainment of specified Performance Objectives or such other criteria as the Committee may determine.  
  (b)  Except as may be provided by the Committee, Deferred Stock Awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered during the                        Deferral Period.  
  (c)  At the expiration of the Deferral Period, the recipient (or his or her designated beneficiary in the event of death) shall receive (i) certificates                        for the number of shares of Stock equal to the number of shares covered by the Deferred Stock Award, (ii) cash equal to the fair market value of such Stock, or (iii) a combination of shares and cash, as the Committee may determine.  
  (d)  In the event of a recipient's termination of employment or other service before the Deferred Stock has vested, his or her Deferred Stock Award shall                        be forfeited.  
  (e)  The Committee may waive, in whole or in part, any or all of the conditions to receipt of, or restrictions with respect to, Stock or cash under a                        Deferred Stock Award in a manner that does not violate the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  
[END TABLE]
Section             10.BONUS STOCK
The Committee may award Bonus Stock to an Eligible Person subject to such terms and conditions           as the Committee shall determine, provided no person who is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company shall be entitled to receive such an Award.  The grant of Bonus Stock may be conditioned upon the attainment           of specified Performance Objectives or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine.  The Committee may waive such conditions in whole or in part other than with respect to Performance Awards in a manner that does not violate the           requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  Unless otherwise specified by the Committee, no money shall be paid by the recipient for Bonus Stock.  Alternatively, the Committee may offer Eligible Persons the opportunity to purchase Bonus Stock at a           discount from its fair market value.  The Bonus Stock Award shall be satisfied by the delivery of the designated number of shares of Stock which are not subject to restriction.
Section             11.ELECTION TO DEFER AWARDS
Subject to compliance with applicable law, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the           Code, the Committee may permit an Eligible Person to elect to defer receipt of an Award for a specified period or until a specified event, upon such terms as are determined by the Board.

The obligations of                        the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company (and, where applicable, any Related Company), shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any                        payment of any kind otherwise due to the employee.  
  12.2  To the extent permitted by the Committee, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may provide, an employee may elect to have the                        withholding tax obligations, or any additional tax obligation with respect to any Awards hereunder, satisfied by (i) having the Company withhold shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to such person with respect to the Award (not in                        excess of the statutory minimum withholding requirement) or (ii) delivering to the Company shares of unrestricted Stock.  Alternatively, the Committee may require that a portion of the shares of Stock otherwise deliverable be applied                        to satisfy the withholding tax obligations with respect to the Award.  
[END TABLE]
Section             13.AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

  (c)  The Committee may, in its discretion and upon at least ten days advance notice to the affected persons, cancel any outstanding Awards, and pay to                        the holders thereof within five business days of such event, in cash, the value of such Awards based upon the highest price per share of Company Common Stock received or to be received by shareholders of the Company in connection with                        the Change in Control (which in the case of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be deemed to be equal to the difference, if any, of such highest price and the exercise or base price thereof multiplied by the number of                        shares of Stock subject thereto), provided that, with respect to any Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code that is so cancelled, settlement of such Award may only be                        accelerated if such Change of Control constitutes a change in control event within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  
  14.2  A "Change of Control" shall be deemed to occur subsequent to the date of the Plan on:  
  (a)  the date that any person or group deemed a person under Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (other than the Company                        and its subsidiaries or any director or officer of the Company as determined immediately prior to that date) has become the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly (with beneficial ownership determined as provided in Rule 13d-3, or                        any successor rule, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company having the right under ordinary                        circumstances to vote at an election of the Board, unless such person has purchased or acquired 80% or more of such securities directly from the Company;  
  (b)  the date on which a majority of the members of the Board shall consist of persons other than Current Directors (for these purposes, a "Current                        Director" shall mean a member of the Board on the effective date of the Plan, as well as any member of the Board whose nomination or election has been approved by a majority of the Current Directors then on the Board);

[BEGIN TABLE]
  15.1  Each Award under the Plan shall be subject to the                          requirement that, if at any time the Company shall determine that (i) the listing, registration or qualification of the Stock subject or related thereto upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or (ii) the                          consent or approval of any government regulatory body or (iii) an agreement by the recipient of an Award with respect to the disposition of Stock is necessary or desirable (in connection with any requirement or interpretation of any                          federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Award or the issuance, purchase or delivery of Stock thereunder, such Award shall not be granted or exercised, in                          whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or agreement shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.  
  15.2  Nothing set forth in this Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements.  Neither the adoption of the                          Plan nor any Award hereunder shall confer upon any Award recipient any right to continued employment or other service in any capacity.  
  15.3  Determinations by the Committee under the Plan relating to the form, amount, and terms and conditions of Awards need not be uniform, and may be                          made selectively among persons who receive or are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, whether or not such persons are similarly situated.  
  15.4  No member of the Board or the Committee, nor any officer or employee of the Company acting on behalf of the Board or the Committee, shall be                          personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation taken or made with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Board or the Committee and all officers or employees of the Company acting on their behalf shall, to                          the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company in respect of any such action, determination or interpretation.  
  15.5  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its principles of conflicts                          of law.
