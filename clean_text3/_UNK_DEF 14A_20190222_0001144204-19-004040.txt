PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  TO BE HELD FEBRUARY 22, 2019
GENERAL
This proxy statement is furnished to you in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") of proxies for use at our annual meeting of shareholders and at any and all adjournments thereof (the "annual meeting" or the "meeting") to be held at the executive offices of the Fund, 800 Hickory Blvd. SW, Lenoir, North Carolina 28645, on Friday, February 22, 2019, at 10:30 a.m., for the purpose of considering and acting upon the matters specified in the accompanying notice of the meeting and detailed below. The Fund is soliciting such proxies by mail on behalf of its Board of Directors and is bearing the expenses of the solicitation. The approximate date that we are first sending this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy form to shareholders is January 31, 2019.
The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on January 10, 2019 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. On the record date, 4,933,281 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, each share being entitled to one vote. Information concerning beneficial ownership of our common stock by our principal shareholders and by Fund management is set forth below. See "Beneficial Ownership of Principal Shareholders and Management" and "Certain Beneficial Interests of Directors in the Fund,"   below.
You may vote in person at the annual meeting, vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card, or vote by proxy via facsimile or email. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted.
Shares represented by proxies will be voted by the proxy agents named therein unless such proxies are revoked. The proxy agents will vote the proxies that they hold in accordance with the choices specified by the person giving the respective proxy. If the enclosed proxy card is properly signed and returned to the Fund but reflects no specification as to how the proxy agents should vote, the proxy agents will vote the shares represented thereby for the election of the slate of nominees listed on the proxy.
Any shareholder who submits the accompanying proxy card has the right to revoke it by notifying the Secretary of the Fund in writing at any time prior to the voting of the proxy. A proxy is suspended if the person giving the proxy attends the meeting and elects to vote in person.
The holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitute a quorum for purposes of the matters to be considered at the annual meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is considered present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and any adjournment thereof (unless a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting). Abstentions and shares which are withheld as to voting with respect to a proposal are counted in determining the existence of a quorum, but shares held by a broker, as nominee, and not voted on any matter will not be counted for determining the existence of a quorum.
Brokers who are members of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., or NYSE, and who hold shares of our common stock in street name for beneficial owners have authority to vote on certain items when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. Under the rules of the NYSE, the proposal to elect directors of the Fund is a "non-discretionary" item, which means that brokers that have not received voting instructions from beneficial owners with respect to this matter may not vote on the proposal.
Assuming the existence of a quorum, the persons receiving a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote will be elected as directors. Abstentions, shares which are withheld as to voting with respect to a proposal and shares held of record by a broker, as nominee, that are not voted with respect to a proposal will not be counted as a vote in favor of or against the proposal and, therefore, will have no effect on the election of directors.
The Board of Directors is not aware of any business to come before the meeting other than the matters described in the accompanying notice of the meeting. If any other matters of business are properly presented at the meeting, however, the proxy agents will vote upon such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our bylaws provide that the number of directors of the Fund shall be not less than three nor more than 15. On December 14, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the size of the Board from 11 to 12 directors, effective as of the date of the annual meeting. The members of the Board of Directors who are considered not to be "interested persons" of the Fund, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), have approved the selection and nomination of each candidate who, if elected, would be a director under the 1940 Act. Unless contrary action is specified by a shareholder on the enclosed proxy card, the proxy agents named in the proxy card intend to vote the proxies received by them for the election of the 12 nominees listed below, who, if elected, will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors have been elected and qualified.
If any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve, the proxies will be voted for a replacement nominee designated by the present Board of Directors or the number of directors to be elected will be reduced.
The corporation laws of North Carolina, under which the Fund is incorporated, provide that shareholders of a company, such as the Fund, incorporated before July 1, 1957, under a charter not granting the right of cumulative voting and which has at the time of the election of directors one shareholder who owns or controls more than 25% of the company's voting stock, shall have the right to cumulate their votes for directors. Because no shareholder currently owns or controls more than 25% of the Fund's voting shares, cumulative voting will not be available to shareholders of the Fund at the meeting.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The following table provides certain information about the executive officers of the Fund who do not serve on the Board of Directors:
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Composition
In accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Fund's Corporate Governance Guidelines, at least 40% of the members of the Fund's Board of Directors must not be interested persons of the Fund. The Board has determined that Kevin P. Boudreau, Margaret M. "Peg" Broyhill, R. Donald Farmer, Robert G. Fox, Jr., and Mark E. Roberts are not interested persons of the Fund.
Committees
The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board in July 2000, as amended and restated by the Board on July 26, 2003 and as further revised on February 24, 2007 and June 3, 2016. A copy of the Audit Committee's charter is available on the Fund's website (http://www.bmcfund.com). The Audit Committee currently consists of Kevin P. Boudreau, R. Donald Farmer (Chairman) and Robert G. Fox, Jr. Each such Audit Committee member is an "independent director," as defined under NYSE rules, and not an interested person of the Fund (the requirements of the NYSE are not applicable to the Fund). The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the hiring, firing, overseeing the work of and determining the compensation for the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm (subject to the requirement of the 1940 Act that a majority of the Fund's directors who are not interested persons of the Fund ratify the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm). The independent registered public accounting firm reports directly to the Audit Committee.
The Board of Directors has an Investment Committee, the members of which are James T. Broyhill, M. Hunt Broyhill (Chairman), Paul H. Broyhill, Christopher R. Pavese (Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of the Fund), Mark E. Roberts and Allene B. Stevens. Each member of the Investment Committee is an interested person of the Fund except Mr. Roberts. The Investment Committee is responsible for reviewing the Fund's investments at the request of management. Under the Fund's Investment Policy Statement, the Investment Committee has substantial oversight responsibility with respect to the Fund's investments.
The Board of Directors has a Nominating Committee, the members of which are R. Donald Farmer, Robert G. Fox, Jr. (Chairman) and Mark E. Roberts. The Board has determined that each member of the Nominating Committee is an "independent director," as defined under NYSE rules, and not an interested person of the Fund. The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board qualified candidates for Board membership. The Nominating Committee was formed on September 28, 2004 and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board on December 8, 2004. A copy of the Nominating Committee's charter is available on the Fund's website (http://www.bmcfund.com).
The Board of Directors has a Valuation Committee, the members of which are W. Charles Campbell, R. Donald Farmer and Robert G. Fox, Jr. (Chairman). Mr. Campbell is the only member of the Valuation Committee who is an interested person of the Fund. The purpose of the Valuation Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its duty to determine the valuation of the assets of the Fund in accordance with the Fund's Asset Valuation Procedures.
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
M. Hunt Broyhill, an interested person of the Fund, is the President and Chairman of the Board of the Fund, and the Board has determined that this leadership structure is appropriate for the Fund. We believe that the strength of our non-interested directors and our overall governance practices minimize any potential conflicts that otherwise could result from combining the positions of President and Chairman. The Board does not have a lead independent director. However, at least once per year, the directors who are not interested persons of the Fund (as well as the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and Secretary/Treasurer) meet in executive session with the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who oversees the implementation of Compliance Policies and Procedures that are reasonably designed to minimize the risk of violations of the federal securities laws. The Fund's interested directors may not attend such sessions. One non-interested director presides at each such executive session. In addition to meeting at least once per year with the directors who are not interested persons of the Fund, the CCO provides presentations to the Board at its quarterly meetings. The Board has approved the Fund's Compliance Policies and Procedures and reviews the CCO's reports with respect thereto, including the CCO's annual written report on the operation of such Compliance Policies and Procedures. Further, the Board reviews quarterly the adequacy and effectiveness of the Fund's Compliance Policies and Procedures. The Board annually appoints or reappoints the CCO and approves his compensation.
Our Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight. The Board as a whole exercises its oversight responsibilities with respect to actual and potential risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, as well as cybersecurity risk. The Board has delegated oversight of certain types of risks to its committees, primarily the Investment Committee, Audit Committee and Valuation Committee. With respect to cybersecurity risk, the Audit Committee engages regularly with the CCO to understand the internal and external cybersecurity threats to and vulnerabilities of the Fund's information and technology systems, and periodically assesses the effectiveness of the Fund's Compliance Policies and Procedures, reporting its findings to the Board. In addition, the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm meets annually with the Audit Committee with respect to various aspects of risk management, as well as applicable events and circumstances that have arisen, if any, and responses thereto.
Meeting and Attendance
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, our Board held four meetings, the Audit Committee held three meetings, the Investment Committee held four meetings, the Nominating Committee held one meeting and the Valuation Committee held four meetings. In addition, the members of the Board who are not interested persons of the Fund held one meeting. Each incumbent member of the Board of Directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, all directors are expected to make every effort to attend meetings of the Board, the committees of which they are members and the annual meeting of shareholders. All members of the Board of Directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
Procedures for Director Nominations
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, members of the Board are expected to collectively possess a broad range of skills, industry and other knowledge and expertise, and business and other experience useful for the effective oversight of the Fund's business. The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board qualified candidates for membership. Candidates are evaluated based on criteria established from time to time by the Board and the criteria identified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include, but are not limited to:
The Nominating Committee is authorized to develop additional policies regarding Board size, composition and member qualification. Neither the Nominating Committee nor the Board has adopted a formal policy regarding diversity. However, the Board intends to keep a diversity of skills and attitudes in its board makeup, and it assesses those qualities in all incumbent directors and potential director nominees. The Nominating Committee evaluates suggestions concerning possible candidates for election to the Board submitted to the Fund, including those submitted by Board members and shareholders. All candidates, including those submitted by shareholders, will be similarly evaluated by the Nominating Committee using the Board membership criteria described above and in accordance with applicable procedures. Once candidates have been identified, the Nominating Committee will determine whether such candidates meet the qualifications for director nominees established in the Corporate Governance Guidelines or under applicable laws, rules or regulations. The Board, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Nominating Committee, is responsible for selecting the nominees for director and for appointing directors to fill vacancies.
The Nominating Committee has authority to retain and approve the compensation of search firms to be used to identify director candidates. No third party is currently retained by the Nominating Committee to identify such candidates.
As noted above, the Nominating Committee will consider qualified director nominees recommended by shareholders when such recommendations are submitted in accordance with applicable Commission requirements, the Fund's bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines and any other applicable law, rule or regulation regarding director nominations. When submitting a nomination to the Fund for consideration, a shareholder must provide certain information that would be required under applicable Commission rules, including the following minimum information for each director nominee: full name, age and address; principal occupation during the past five years; current directorships on publicly held companies and investment companies; and number of shares of Fund common stock owned, if any.
Shareholder Communications with Directors
Any shareholder desiring to contact the Board, or any specific director(s), may send written communications to: Board of Directors (Attention: (Name(s) of director(s), as applicable)), c/o the Fund's Secretary, 800 Hickory Blvd. SW, Lenoir, North Carolina 28645. Any proper communications so received will be processed by the Secretary. If it is unclear from the communication received whether it was intended or appropriate for the Board, the Secretary will (subject to any applicable regulatory requirements) use her judgment to determine whether such communication should be conveyed to the Board or, as appropriate, to the member(s) of the Board named in the communication.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
As noted above, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for hiring, firing, overseeing the work of and determining the compensation for the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm (subject to the requirement of the 1940 Act that a majority of the Fund's directors who are not interested persons of the Fund ratify the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm). The independent registered public accounting firm reports directly to the Audit Committee.
Management is responsible for preparing the Fund's financial statements. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Fund's audited financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 1301, Communications with Audit Committees.
The Fund's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence.
Based on the above discussions and review with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Fund's annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for filing with the Commission.

Administration of the Fund is primarily the responsibility of the Fund's Chairman and President, M. Hunt Broyhill, its Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Boyd C.

Fox, Jr., a director of the Fund, regarding alleged charges of unsafe and unsound banking practices and breach of fiduciary duties under Sections 8(e) and 8(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"). Mr. Fox consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any unsafe or unsound banking practices or breaches of fiduciary duty. Pursuant to the Order, Mr. Fox is prohibited, without prior written approval of the FDIC, from certain activities involving financial institutions and organizations enumerated under Section 8(e)(7)(A) of the FDIA, including participating in the conduct of the affairs of such institutions and exercising voting or proxy rights with respect to such institutions. The Order also assessed a civil penalty of $3,000 against Mr. Fox.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, certain officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock to report their beneficial ownership of our common stock and any changes in that ownership to the Commission. Specific dates for such reporting have been established, and we are required to report in this proxy statement any failure to file required reports by the established dates during the last fiscal year. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, and information provided to us by our directors, officers and 10% shareholders, we believe that all forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 16(a) were filed on a timely basis during the last fiscal year.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
In order to be included in proxy material for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholder proposals must be received at the offices of the Fund by September 27, 2019 and must be submitted in accordance with applicable procedures.
Shareholder proposals which are not intended to be included in the proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting must be submitted to the Fund no later than December 11, 2019. Only business properly brought before an annual meeting may be subject to action at the meeting. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to consider any business that is not raised in accordance with these procedures. A proxy may confer discretionary authority to vote on any matter at an annual meeting if the Fund does not receive proper notice of the matter within the timeframe described above.
ANNUAL AND SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS
The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its annual report (and the most recent semi-annual report succeeding the annual report, if any) for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, to a shareholder upon request. Any such request should be directed to the Secretary of the Fund by writing to Wendy S. Sims at the Fund, 800 Hickory Blvd. SW, Lenoir, North Carolina 28645. (A stamped, addressed postal card is enclosed for use in requesting such report.) This annual report was previously furnished to shareholders on or about December 17, 2018.
HOUSEHOLDING OF ANNUAL MEETING MATERIALS
Only one copy of our proxy statement and annual report has been sent to multiple shareholders in the same household, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the applicable shareholders. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of either document to any shareholder upon request submitted in writing to Wendy S. Sims at the Fund, 800 Hickory Blvd. SW, Lenoir, North Carolina 28645, or by telephone ((828) 758-6100). Any shareholder who wants to receive separate copies of the annual report and proxy statement in the future, or who is currently receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for his or her household, should contact the Fund at the above address and telephone number.
OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board of Directors knows of no other business to come before the annual meeting for consideration by the Fund's shareholders. If any other business properly comes before the meeting, the persons named as proxy agents in the accompanying proxy card will vote the shares represented by valid proxies in accordance with their best judgment.
