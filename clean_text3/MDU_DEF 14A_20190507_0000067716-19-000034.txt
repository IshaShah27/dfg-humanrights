Fellow Stockholders:
I invite you to join me, our Board of Directors and members of our senior management team for our annual meeting at 11 a.m. CDT May 7, 2019, at 909 Airport Road in Bismarck, North Dakota.
At the meeting, stockholders will vote on the items outlined in this proxy statement, including election of our Board of Directors, approval of our independent auditors, and approval of the amended certificates of incorporation for MDU Resources Group and Montana-Dakota Utilities.
Our director slate up for election includes three candidates who have not previously been on the ballot: Edward A. Ryan, David M. Sparby and Chenxi Wang. Edward and David were appointed to the board during 2018. Chenxi has been put forward as a candidate by our Nominating and Governance Committee because of her expertise in technology and cybersecurity. These three new candidates will help ensure a smooth leadership transition as Bart Holaday did not stand for re-election in 2018 and Harry Pearce and Bill McCracken will not stand for re-election this year. Our corporate bylaws state that directors are not eligible for election to the board after their 76th birthday. We deeply appreciate the diligent and faithful service that Harry, Bart and Bill have provided to MDU Resources' stockholders. Harry, especially, has served you well in his 22 years as a director, including five years as independent lead director and the past 14 years as chair of the board.
Also before stockholders for a vote are resolutions to amend the certificates of incorporation for MDU Resources and Montana-Dakota Utilities. These amendments follow the reorganization of our corporate structure at the start of 2019. The reorganization was undertaken to further delineate the separation between our utility companies and our other businesses. Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. and Great Plains Natural Gas Co. were originally structured as divisions of MDU Resources, as required by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the PUHCA and allowed us to restructure these companies as a subsidiary. Montana-Dakota Utilities is now a subsidiary of MDU Resources and Great Plains Natural Gas is a division of Montana-Dakota Utilities. This reorganization simplifies our corporate structure and provides greater flexibility in our financing options.
In addition to the business items to be conducted at the annual meeting, I will provide an overview of our strong 2018 financial results and the acquisitions and other growth projects we accomplished. We started 2019 with strong momentum, and I will tell you more about the record backlog of work we have at our construction operations and the additional growth projects we expect to complete this year.
I look forward to seeing you May 7. Details on how to receive an admission ticket to attend our annual meeting are included in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders as well as on page 67 of this Proxy Statement. 
If you cannot attend the annual stockholder meeting, your vote is still important to us. I ask that you please promptly follow the instructions on your notice or proxy card to vote.
We appreciate your continued investment in MDU Resources and remain committed to providing the long-term value you expect.

  David L. Goodin

Business Performance Highlights       
Our overall performance in 2018 was consistent with our long-term strategy as we focused on growing our regulated energy delivery and construction materials and services business segments. In addition to our 2018 financial performance highlighted on the next page: 
■ Our electric distribution segment completed the purchase of the Thunder Spirit Wind Farm expansion in southwest North Dakota. The purchase boosts the production capacity of the wind farm from 107.5 megawatts to 155 megawatts of renewable energy. This increases the segment's renewable generation capacity from 22% to 27% of its total generation capacity. Construction continued in 2018 on the 345-kilovolt transmission line project from Ellendale, North Dakota, to Big Stone City, South Dakota, and was completed in February 2019.  
■ Our construction materials and contracting segment completed the following four acquisitions during 2018: 
  o Sweetman Const. Co. located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; 
  o Teevin & Fischer Quarry, LLC located in northern Oregon; 
  o Tri-City Paving, Inc. located in Little Falls, Minnesota; and o Molalla Redi-Mix and Rock Products, Inc. located south of Portland, Oregon. 
■ The pipeline and midstream segment in 2018 had record transportation volumes for the second consecutive year. The segment expanded Line Section 27 of its natural gas transportation system in northwestern North Dakota. The project involved construction of approximately 13 miles of pipeline and associated facilities. The expansion provides Line Section 27 with capacity to transport over 600,000 dekatherms per day. The segment also completed construction of its 38-mile Valley Expansion Project transmission line in eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota. The segment is proceeding with construction planning on its Demicks Lake Project in McKenzie County, North Dakota, and Line Section 22 Project near Billings, Montana. Both of these projects are expected to be completed in 2019.   
■ On January 1, 2019, we completed a holding company reorganization to provide additional financing flexibility and further separation between the company's utility and other business segments. As a result of the reorganization, all of the company's utility operations will be conducted through wholly-owned subsidiaries.  
Including our accomplishments in 2018, we are optimistic about the company's future financial performance. The chart below shows our progress over the last five years.

Compensation Highlights 
The company's executive compensation is focused on paying for performance. Our compensation program is structured to strongly align compensation with the company's financial performance as a substantial portion of our executive compensation is based upon performance incentive awards. 
■ Over 75% of our chief executive officer's target compensation and over 58% of our other named executive officers' target compensation is performance based. 
■ 100% of our chief executive officer's annual and long-term incentive compensation is tied to performance against pre-established, specific, measurable financial goals.  
■ We require our executive officers to own a significant amount of company stock based upon a multiple of their base salary.

Key Features of Our Executive Compensation Program
[BEGIN TABLE]
What We Do 
þ Pay for Performance - Annual and long-term award incentives tied to performance measures set by the compensation committee comprise the largest portion of executive compensation.  
þ Independent Compensation Committee - All members of the compensation committee meet the independence standards under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. 
þ Independent Compensation Consultant - The compensation committee retains an independent compensation consultant to evaluate executive compensation plans and practices. 
þ Competitive Compensation - Executive compensation reflects executive performance, experience, relative value compared to other positions within the company, relationship to competitive market value compensation, business segment economic environment, and the actual performance of the overall company and the business segments. 
þ Annual Cash Incentive - Payment of annual cash incentive awards are based on business segment and overall company performance against pre-established financial measures. 
þ Long-Term Equity Incentive - The long-term performance-based equity incentive in the form of performance shares represents approximately 56% of our CEO's and approximately 37% of our other named executive officers' 2018 target compensation, which may only be earned based on achievement of established performance measures at the end of a three-year period. 
þ Annual Compensation Risk Analysis - We regularly analyze the risks related to our compensation programs and conduct an annual broad risk assessment. 
þ Stock Ownership and Retention Requirements - Executive officers are required to own, within five years of appointment or promotion, company common stock equal to a multiple of their base salary. The executive officers also must retain at least 50% of the net after-tax shares of stock vested through the long-term incentive plan for at least two years or until termination of employment. 
þ Clawback Policy - If the company's audited financial statements are restated, the compensation committee may, or shall if required, demand repayment of some or all incentives paid to our executive officers within the last three years. 
What We Do Not Do 
ý Stock Options - The company does not use stock options as a form of incentive compensation.   
ý Employment Agreements - Executives do not have employment agreements entitling them to specific payments upon termination or a change of control of the company. 
ý Perquisites - Executives do not receive perquisites that materially differ from those available to employees in general. 
ý Hedge Stock - Executives and directors are not allowed to hedge company securities. 
ý Pledge Stock - Executives and directors are not allowed to pledge company securities in margin accounts or as collateral for loans.

■ As our renewable generation resource capacity has increased, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission intensity of our electric generation resource fleet has been reduced by approximately 24% since 2003. We expect it to continue to decline in future years. 
■ Renewable resources comprised approximately 27% of our electric generation resource nameplate capacity at December 31, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
■ Approximately 21% of the electricity delivered to our customers from company-owned generation in 2018 was from renewable resources. 
■ We invested approximately $133 million in environmental emission control equipment and other environmental improvements at our coal-fired electric generation plants since 2013. The investments have resulted in substantial reductions in mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and filterable particulate emissions from our coal-fired electric generation resources. 
■ Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. produces renewable natural gas (RNG) from the Billings Regional Landfill in Montana. The project came online at the end of 2010 and has produced approximately 1.1 million dekatherm of RNG through year-end 2018. The RNG is supplied to the vehicle fuel market generating renewable identification numbers (RINS) and low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credits in California and Oregon. In calendar year 2018, the Billings Landfill Plant produced approximately 1.86 million RINs and 3,250 LCFS credits. 
■ Our utility companies received high scores in customer satisfaction. Cascade Natural Gas Corporation ranked first, Intermountain Gas Company second, and Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. third among West Region mid-sized natural gas utilities in the 2018 J.D. Power Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey. 
■ We were recognized on the Thomson Reuters 2017 Top 25 Global Multiline Utilities list. The list recognizes companies that have demonstrated a commitment to energy leadership in these areas: financial, management and investor confidence, risk and resilience, legal compliance, innovation, people and social sustainability, environmental impact, and reputation.

■ Knife River Corporation produces and places warm-mix asphalt in applications where warm-mix asphalt is allowed. Warm-mix asphalt is produced at cooler temperatures than traditional hot-mix asphalt methods, which reduces the amount of fuel needed in the production process and thereby reduces emissions and fumes.  
■ Knife River Corporation continued its practice of recycling and reusing building materials. This conserves natural resources, uses less energy, alleviates waste disposal problems in local landfills, and ultimately costs less for the consumer.  
■ Our subsidiary, Bombard Renewable Energy, was ranked No. 13 on Solar Power World's 2018 Top 500 Solar Contractors List. The list ranks companies according to their influence in the U.S. solar industry based on how many kilowatts of solar generation they installed in 2017. 
■ The MDU Resources Foundation awarded grants of $1.68 million to educational and nonprofit institutions in 2018. Since its incorporation in 1983, the foundation has contributed more than $34 million to worthwhile causes in categories of education, civic and community activities, culture and arts, environmental stewardship, and health and human services. 
■ We encourage and support community volunteerism by our employees. The MDU Resources Foundation contributes a $500 grant to an eligible nonprofit organization after an employee volunteers a minimum of 25 hours to the organization during non-company hours during a calendar year. In 2018, the foundation granted $40,500 under this program, matching over 4,850 employee volunteer hours.

In February 2019, the board of directors determined to reduce the number of directors to ten effective with the 2019 annual meeting and has nominated Chenxi Wang as a new director nominee to stand for election to the board at the annual meeting.
The board has affirmatively determined that all the director nominees, other than David L. Goodin, our president and chief executive officer, are independent in accordance with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, our governance guidelines, and our bylaws.
Our bylaws provide for a majority voting standard for the election of directors. See "Additional Information - Majority Voting" below for further detail.
Each of the director nominees has consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve as a director, if elected. We do not know of any reason why any nominee would be unable or unwilling to serve as a director, if elected. If, however, a nominee becomes unable to serve or will not serve, proxies may be voted for the election of such other person nominated by the board as a substitute or the board may further reduce the number of directors. 
Information about each director nominee's share ownership is presented below under "Security Ownership."
The shares represented by the proxies received will be voted for the election of each of the ten nominees named below, unless you indicate in the proxy that your vote should be cast against any or all the director nominees or that you abstain from voting. Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified or until the earliest of his or her resignation, retirement, or death.
The ten nominees for election to the board at the 2019 annual meeting, all proposed by the board, are listed below with brief biographies.

Additional Information - Majority Voting
A majority of votes cast is required to elect a director in an uncontested election. A majority of votes cast means the number of votes cast "for" a director's election must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the director's election. "Abstentions" and "broker non-votes" do not count as votes cast "for" or "against" the director's election. In a contested election, which is an election in which the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected and which we do not anticipate, directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast.
Unless you specify otherwise when you submit your proxy, the proxies will vote your shares of common stock "for" all directors nominated by the board of directors. If a nominee becomes unavailable for any reason or if a vacancy should occur before the election, which we do not anticipate, the proxies will vote your shares in their discretion for another person nominated by the board.
Our policy on majority voting for directors contained in our corporate governance guidelines requires any proposed nominee for re-election as a director to tender to the board, prior to nomination, his or her irrevocable resignation from the board that will be effective, in an uncontested election of directors only, upon:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receipt of a greater number of votes "against" than votes "for" election at our annual meeting of stockholders; and 
• acceptance of such resignation by the board of directors. 
[END TABLE]
Following certification of the stockholder vote, the nominating and governance committee will promptly recommend to the board whether or not to accept the tendered resignation. The board will act on the nominating and governance committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the annual meeting.
Brokers may not vote your shares on the election of directors if you have not given your broker specific instructions on how to vote. Please be sure to give specific voting instructions to your broker so your vote can be counted.

Board Evaluations and Process for Selecting Directors
In the annual board evaluation process, the nominating and governance committee evaluates our directors considering the current needs of the board and the company. In addition, during the year, the committee discusses board succession and reviews potential candidates. The committee may also retain a third party to assist in identifying potential nominees; none were retained in 2018.
Our annual board evaluation process involves assessments at the board and board committee levels. These annual evaluations are conducted by the chair of the nominating and governance committee and periodically by an independent third party.
Our governance guidelines provide that directors are not eligible to be nominated or appointed to the board if they are 76 years or older at the time of the election or appointment. Term limits on directors' service have not been instituted.
Director Qualifications, Skills, and Experience
Director nominees are chosen to serve on the board based on their qualifications, skills, and experience, as discussed in their biographies, and how those characteristics supplement the resources and talent on the board and serve the current needs of the board and the company. 
In making its nominations, the nominating and governance committee also assesses each director nominee by a number of key characteristics, including character, success in a chosen field of endeavor, background in publicly traded companies, independence, and willingness to commit the time needed to satisfy the requirements of board and committee membership. Although the committee has no formal policy regarding diversity, the committee also considers diversity in gender, ethnic background, geographic area of residence, skills, and professional experience in recommending director nominees.

Board Composition and Refreshment
The nominating and governance committee is focused on ensuring that the board reflects a diversity of experience, skills, and backgrounds. Each of the current directors, other than Harry J. Pearce and William E. McCracken, has been nominated for election to the board of directors upon recommendation by the nominating and governance committee and each has decided to stand for election. Messrs. Pearce and McCracken were not eligible for re-election under the company's age limit policy that provides no individual is eligible for election to the board of directors after his or her 76th birthday.
With the retirement of former board member A. Bart Holaday at the annual meeting in May 2018 and Harry J. Pearce and William E. McCracken reaching our board retirement age limit and retiring from the board at our 2019 annual meeting, the committee identified qualified diverse director candidates with commensurate experience and background as replacement board members.
In evaluating the board retirements and current needs of the board and the company, the nominating and governance committee focused on identifying board candidates that would add gender diversity to the board as well as background and core competencies in the fields of regulated energy delivery, technology and cybersecurity, and public company governance. Potential director nominees were brought to the attention of the nominating and governance committee by board members, management, organizations, and database searches. 
In 2018, the nominating and governance committee identified a need for additional expertise in the operation of electric and natural gas utilities and natural gas transmission pipelines. At December 31, 2018, approximately 66% of our capital was invested in these business segments which generated approximately 28% of our 2018 revenues. After serving in several positions during his 32-year career with Xcel Energy, including chief financial officer, and most recently as senior vice president, revenue group, and chief executive officer of its subsidiary, Northern States Power-Minnesota, David M. Sparby brings a vast amount of experience related to the electric and natural gas distribution and pipeline industries. Mr. Sparby was appointed to the board of directors on August 16, 2018.
With the anticipated retirement of Harry J. Pearce, the nominating and governance committee identified a director nominee with extensive risk management and public company governance experience. Prior to his retirement in 2017, Edward A. Ryan served as executive vice president and general counsel for Marriott International, Inc. where his responsibilities included chair of the company's legal and ethical steering and enterprise crisis management committees. Mr. Ryan was appointed to the board of directors on November 15, 2018.
With the anticipated retirement of William E. McCracken, the nominating and governance committee identified a director nominee that would bring diversity as well as technology and cybersecurity expertise to the board. Chenxi Wang has held positions with various organizations related to technology and security software and is a frequent speaker on issues of technology and cybersecurity. She is currently the founder and general partner of Rain Capital Fund, L.P., an early stage venture capital firm focused on cybersecurity innovation and artificial intelligence for its clients and the promotion of women entrepreneurs. Ms. Wang also provides gender, ethnic, age, and geographic diversity to the board.
By tenure, if the nominees are elected, the board will comprise of three directors who have served from 0-4 years, two directors who have served from 5-10 years, and five directors who have served over 11 years. This mix provides a balance of experience and institutional knowledge with fresh perspectives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Director Independence
The board of directors has adopted guidelines on director independence that are included in our corporate governance guidelines. Our guidelines require that a substantial majority of the board consists of independent directors. In general, the guidelines require that an independent director must have no material relationship with the company directly or indirectly, except as a director. The board determines independence on the basis of the standards specified by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the additional standards referenced in our corporate governance guidelines, and other facts and circumstances the board considers relevant. Based on its review, the board has determined that all directors and director nominees, except for our chief executive officer Mr. Goodin, have no material relationship with us and are independent. 
In determining director independence, the board of directors reviewed and considered information about any transactions, relationships, and arrangements between the non-employee directors and director nominees and their immediate family members and affiliated entities on the one hand, and the company and its affiliates on the other, and in particular the following transactions, relationships, and arrangements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Charitable contributions by the MDU Resources Foundation (Foundation) to nonprofit organizations where a director, a director nominee, or their spouse, serves or has served as a director, chair, or vice chair of the board of trustees, trustee or member of the organization or related entity: Charitable contributions by the Foundation to four nonprofit organizations that collectively amounted to $27,500 in 2018. None of the contributions made to any of the nonprofit entities exceeded the greater of $1 million or 2% of the relevant entity's consolidated gross revenues. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business relationships with entities with which a director or director nominee is affiliated: Mr. Wilson is a member of the board of directors of HDR, Inc., an architectural, engineering, environmental, and consulting firm. The company paid HDR, Inc. or its affiliates approximately $1 million in 2018 directly or through a third party for services which were provided in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms prevailing for comparable services from other consulting firms. Mr. Wilson had no role in securing or promoting the HDR, Inc. services. 
[END TABLE]
The board has also determined that all members of the audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees of the board are independent in accordance with our guidelines and applicable NYSE and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rules. 
Stockholder Engagement
The company has an active stockholder outreach program. We believe in providing transparent and timely information to our investors. Each year we routinely engage directly or indirectly with our stockholders, including our top institutional stockholders. During 2018, the company held meetings, conference calls, and webcasts with a diverse mix of stockholders. Throughout the year, we held meetings or telephone conferences with eleven of the institutional investors included in our year-end top 30 stockholders. In our meetings or conferences, we discussed a variety of topics including longer-term company strategy and our capital expenditure forecast; shorter-term operational and financial updates; environmental, social, and corporate governance; and previously announced strategic initiatives. The company also held telephone conferences with a proxy advisory firm to discuss corporate governance, executive compensation practices, and other topics. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The board separated the positions of chair of the board and chief executive officer in 2006, and our bylaws and corporate governance guidelines currently require that our chair be independent. The board believes this structure provides balance and is currently in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Separating these positions allows the chief executive officer to focus on the full-time job of running our business, while allowing the chair of the board to lead the board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management. The chair meets regularly between board meetings with the chief executive officer and consults with the chief executive officer regarding the board meeting agendas, the quality and flow of information provided to the board, and the effectiveness of the board meeting process. The board believes this split structure recognizes the time, effort, and energy the chief executive officer is required to devote to the position in the current business environment, as well as the commitment required to serve as the chair, particularly as the board's oversight responsibilities continue to grow and demand more time and attention. The fundamental role of the board of directors is to provide oversight of the management of the company in good faith and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. Having an independent chair is a means to ensure the chief executive officer is accountable for managing the company in close alignment with the interests of stockholders, including with respect to risk management as discussed below. An independent chair is in a position to encourage frank and lively discussions, including during regularly scheduled executive sessions consisting of only

independent directors, and to assure that the company has adequately assessed all appropriate business risks before adopting its final business plans and strategies. The board believes that having separate positions and having an independent outside director serve as chair is the appropriate leadership structure for the company at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance. With the retirement of Mr. Pearce at the annual meeting, the board will elect a new independent chair at its May board meeting.  
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks, including economic risks, operational risks, environmental and regulatory risks, the impact of competition, climate and weather conditions, limitations on our ability to pay dividends, pension plan obligations, cyberattacks or acts of terrorism, and third party liabilities. Management is responsible for identifying material risks, implementing appropriate risk management strategies, and providing information regarding material risks and risk management to the board. The board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate for identifying, assessing, and managing risk.
The board believes establishing the right "tone at the top" and full and open communication between management and the board of directors are essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our chair meets regularly with our chief executive officer to discuss strategy and risks facing the company. Senior management attends the quarterly board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the board on risk management-related and any other matters. Each quarter, the board of directors receives presentations from senior management on strategic matters involving our operations. Senior management annually presents an assessment to the board of critical enterprise risks that threaten the company's strategy and business model, including risks inherent in the key assumptions underlying the company's business strategy for value creation. Periodically, the board receives presentations from external experts on matters of strategic importance to the board. In 2018, the board heard presentations from external experts regarding climate change and its risks and opportunities, oil and natural gas exploration in the Bakken geological formation in North Dakota, and projected natural gas processing and transportation needs in North Dakota. At least annually, the board holds strategic planning sessions with senior management to discuss strategies, key challenges, and risks and opportunities for the company.
The company has also developed a robust compliance program to promote a culture of compliance, consistent with the right tone at the top, to mitigate risk. The program includes training and adherence to our code of conduct and legal compliance guide. We further mitigate risk through our internal audit and legal departments.
While the board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at our company, our three standing board committees assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The audit committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to risk management in a general manner and specifically in the areas of financial reporting, internal controls, cybersecurity, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and, in accordance with NYSE requirements, discusses with the board policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and their adequacy and effectiveness. The audit committee receives regular reports on the company's compliance program, including reports received through our anonymous reporting hot line. It also receives reports and regularly meets with the company's external and internal auditors. During each of its quarterly meetings in 2018, the audit committee received presentations from management on cybersecurity and the company's mitigation of cybersecurity risks. The entire board was present for these presentations. Risk assessment and mitigation reports are regularly provided by management to the audit committee or the full board. This opens the opportunity for discussions about areas where the company may have material risk exposure, steps taken to manage such exposure, and the company's risk tolerance in relation to company strategy. The audit committee reports regularly to the board of directors on the company's management of risks in the audit committee's areas of responsibility.  
• The compensation committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs.  
• The nominating and governance committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks associated with board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for our directors and executive officers, and corporate governance.

Audit Committee Met Eight Times in 2018 
[END TABLE]
The audit committee is a separately-designated committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The audit committee met eight times during 2018. The audit committee members are Dennis W. Johnson, chair, Mark A. Hellerstein, Edward A. Ryan, David M. Sparby, and John K. Wilson. The board of directors has determined that Messrs. Johnson, Hellerstein, Sparby, and Wilson are "audit committee financial experts" as defined by SEC rules and all audit committee members are financially literate within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. All members also meet the independence standard for audit committee members under our director independence guidelines, the NYSE listing standards, and SEC rules.
The audit committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities to the stockholders and serves as a communication link among the board, management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and the internal auditors. The audit committee:

Compensation Committee Met Four Times in 2018 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, the compensation committee met four times. The compensation committee consists entirely of independent directors within the meaning of the company's corporate governance guidelines and the NYSE listing standards and who meet the definitions of non-employee directors for purposes of Rule 16-b under the Exchange Act. Members of the compensation committee are Thomas Everist, chair, Karen B. Fagg, William E. McCracken, and Patricia L. Moss.
The compensation committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to the company's compensation policy and programs. It has the direct responsibility for determining compensation for our Section 16 officers and for overseeing the company's management of risk in its areas of responsibility. In addition, the compensation committee reviews and recommends any changes to director compensation policies to the board of directors. The authority and responsibility of the compensation committee is outlined in the compensation committee's charter.
The compensation committee uses the analysis and recommendations from outside consultants, the chief executive officer, and the human resources department in making its compensation decisions. The chief executive officer, the vice president-human resources, and the general counsel regularly attend compensation committee meetings. The committee meets in executive session as needed. The processes and procedures for consideration and determination of compensation of the Section 16 officers, as well as the role of our executive officers, are discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The compensation committee has sole authority to retain compensation consultants, legal counsel, or other advisers to assist in consideration of the compensation of the chief executive officer, the other Section 16 officers, and the board of directors, and the committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of such advisers. The compensation committee's practice has been to retain a compensation consultant every other year to conduct a competitive analysis on executive compensation. The competitive analysis is conducted internally by the human resources department in the other years. In 2018, the compensation committee retained a compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, to conduct a competitive analysis on executive compensation for 2019. Prior to retaining an adviser, the compensation committee considers all factors relevant to ensure the adviser's independence from management. Annually the compensation committee conducts a potential conflicts of interest assessment raised by the work of any compensation consultant and how such conflicts, if any, should be addressed. The compensation committee requested and received information from Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC to assist in its potential conflicts of interest assessment. Based on its review and analysis, the compensation committee determined in 2018 that Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC was independent from management. 
The board of directors determines compensation for our non-employee directors based upon recommendations from the compensation committee. The compensation committee's practice has been to retain a compensation consultant every other year to conduct a competitive analysis on director compensation. In 2018, the analysis of non-employee director compensation was performed by the human resources department. Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC will conduct the analysis in 2019.
Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management
The human resources department has conducted an assessment of the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for all employees and concluded that none of these risks is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. Based on the human resources department's assessment and taking into account information received from the risk identification process, senior management and our management policy committee concluded that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. After review and discussion with senior management, the compensation committee concurred with this assessment.
As part of its assessment of the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices, the human resources department identified the principal areas of risk faced by the company that may be affected by our compensation policies and practices, including any risks resulting from our operating businesses' compensation policies and practices. In assessing the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices, the human resources department identified the following practices designed to prevent excessive risk taking:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business management and governance practices: 
◦ risk management is a specific performance competency included in the annual performance assessment of Section 16 officers; 
◦ board oversight on capital expenditure and operating plans promotes careful consideration of financial assumptions; 
[END TABLE]
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   21
Proxy Statement
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ limitation on business acquisitions without board approval; 
◦ employee integrity training programs and anonymous reporting systems; 
◦ quarterly risk assessment reports at audit committee meetings; and 
◦ prohibitions on holding company stock in an account that is subject to a margin call, pledging company stock as collateral for a loan, and hedging of company stock by Section 16 officers and directors. 
• Executive compensation practices: 
◦ active compensation committee review of executive compensation, including portions of executive compensation based upon the company's total stockholder return in relation to that of the company's peer group;  
◦ the initial determination of a position's salary grade to be at or near the 50th percentile of base salaries paid to similar positions at peer group companies and/or relevant industry companies; 
◦ consideration of peer group and/or relevant industry practices to establish appropriate compensation target amounts; 
◦ a balanced compensation mix of fixed salary and annual and long-term incentives tied primarily to the company's financial and stock performance; 
◦ use of interpolation for annual and long-term incentive awards to avoid payout cliffs; 
◦ negative discretion to adjust any annual incentive award payment downward; 
◦ use of caps on annual incentive awards (maximum of 200% for regulated segments and 240% for construction materials and services segments) and long-term incentive stock grant awards (200% of target); 
◦ ability to clawback incentive payments in the event of a financial restatement; 
◦ use of performance shares and restricted stock units, rather than stock options or stock appreciation rights, as an equity component of incentive compensation; 
◦ use of performance shares for long-term incentive awards with relative total stockholder return, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth, and earnings growth performance components; 
◦ use of three-year performance periods for long-term incentive awards to discourage short-term risk-taking; 
◦ substantive annual incentive goals measured primarily by earnings, EBITDA, and earnings per share criteria, which encourage balanced performance and are important to stockholders; 
◦ use of financial performance metrics that are readily monitored and reviewed; 
◦ regular review of the appropriateness of the companies in the peer group; 
◦ stock ownership requirements for the board and for executives receiving long-term incentive awards; 
◦ mandatory holding periods for 50% of any net after-tax shares earned under long-term incentive awards; and 
◦ use of independent consultants to assist in establishing pay targets and compensation structure at least biennially.

Additional Governance Features
Board and Committee Evaluations
Our corporate governance guidelines provide that the board of directors, in coordination with the nominating and governance committee, will annually review and evaluate the performance and functioning of the board and its committees. The self-evaluations are intended to facilitate a candid assessment and discussion by the board and each committee of its effectiveness as a group in fulfilling its responsibilities, its performance as measured against the corporate governance guidelines, and areas for improvement. The board and committee members are provided with a questionnaire to facilitate discussion. The results of the evaluations are reviewed and discussed in executive sessions of the committees and the board of directors.
Director Resignation Upon Change of Job Responsibility
Our corporate governance guidelines require a director to tender his or her resignation after a material change in job responsibility. In 2018, no directors or director nominees submitted resignations under this requirement. 
Majority Voting in Uncontested Director Elections
Our corporate governance guidelines require that in uncontested elections (those where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), director nominees must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast to be elected to our board of directors. Contested director elections (those where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected) are governed by a plurality of the vote of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. 
The board has adopted a director resignation policy for incumbent directors in uncontested elections. Any proposed nominee for re-election as a director shall, before he or she is nominated to serve on the board, tender to the board his or her irrevocable resignation that will be effective, in an uncontested election of directors only, upon (i) such nominee's receipt of a greater number of votes "against" election than votes "for" election at our annual meeting of stockholders; and (ii) acceptance of such resignation by the board of directors.
Director Overboarding Policy 
Our bylaws and corporate governance guidelines state that a director may not serve on more than three public company boards, including the company's board. Currently, all of our directors are in compliance of this policy. 
Board Refreshment
The company regularly evaluates the need for board refreshment. The nominating and governance committee and the board are focused on identifying individuals whose skills and experiences will enable them to make meaningful contributions to shaping the company's business strategy. As part of its consideration of director succession, the nominating and governance committee from time to time reviews, including when considering potential candidates, the appropriate skills and characteristics required of board members. The board believes it is important to consider diversity of skills, expertise, race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, geography, cultural background, and professional experiences in evaluating board candidates for expected contributions to an effective board. Independent directors may not serve on the board beyond the next annual meeting of stockholders after attaining the age of 76. We believe the mandatory retirement age allows us to benefit from experienced directors, with industry expertise, company institutional knowledge and historical perspective, stability, and comfort with challenging company management, while maintaining our ability to refresh the board through the addition of new members. In connection with our mandatory retirement for directors, Harry J. Pearce and William E. McCracken will retire as directors at the completion of their current term following the 2019 annual meeting. 
Prohibitions on Hedging/Pledging Company Stock
The director compensation policy prohibits directors from hedging their ownership of common stock, pledging company stock as collateral for a loan, or holding company stock in an account that is subject to a margin call. 
Code of Conduct
We have a code of conduct and ethics, which we refer to as the Leading With Integrity Guide. It applies to all directors, officers, and employees.
We intend to satisfy our disclosure obligations regarding amendments to, or waivers of, any provision of the code of conduct that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer and that relates to any element of the code of ethics definition in Regulation S-K, Item 406(b), and waivers of the code of conduct for our directors or executive officers, as required by NYSE listing standards, by posting such information on our website.

Proxy Access
In February 2018, the board of directors amended our bylaws to implement proxy access with the following parameters:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Ownership Threshold: 3% of outstanding shares of our common stock 
Nominating Group Size: Up to 20 stockholders may combine to reach the 3% ownership threshold 
Holding Period: Continuously for three years 
Number of Nominees: The greater of two nominees or 20% of our board 
[END TABLE]
We believe these proxy access parameters reflect a well designed and balanced approach to proxy access that mitigates the risk of abuse and protects the interests of all of our stockholders. Stockholders who wish to nominate directors for inclusion in our Proxy Statement in accordance with proxy access must follow the procedures in Section 2.10 of our bylaws. See "Stockholder Proposals, Director Nominations, and Other Items of Business for 2020 Annual Meeting."

Related Person Transaction Disclosure 
The board of directors' policy for the review of related person transactions is contained in our corporate governance guidelines. The policy requires the audit committee to review any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series thereof:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in which the company was or will be a participant;  
• the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and 
• a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  
[END TABLE]
The purpose of this review is to determine whether this transaction is in the best interests of the company. 
Related persons are directors, director nominees, executive officers, holders of 5% or more of our voting stock, and their immediate family members. Related persons are required promptly to report to our general counsel all proposed or existing related person transactions in which they are involved.
If our general counsel determines that the transaction is required to be disclosed under the SEC rules, the general counsel furnishes the information to the chair of the audit committee. After its review, the committee makes a determination or a recommendation to the board and officers of the company with respect to the related person transaction. Upon receipt of the committee's recommendation, the board of directors or officers, as the case may be, take such action as they deem appropriate in light of their responsibilities under applicable laws and regulations.
We had no related person transactions in 2018.

COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Director Compensation for 2018 
MDU Resources' non-employee directors are compensated for their service according to the MDU Resources Group Inc. Director Compensation Policy. Only one company employee, David L. Goodin, the company's president and chief executive officer, serves as a director. Mr. Goodin receives no additional compensation for his service on the board. Director compensation is reviewed annually by the compensation committee with analysis provided by an independent consultant in odd numbered years and analysis prepared by the company's human resources department in even numbered years. The company's human resources department provided the director compensation analysis for 2018. The analysis included research on market trends in director compensation as well as a review of director compensation practices of our peer group companies. Based on the analysis, the compensation committee recommended and the board concurred that no changes would be made to board member compensation for 2018.

There are no meeting fees paid to directors.
Other Compensation
In addition to liability insurance, we maintain group life insurance in the amount of $100,000 on each non-employee director for the benefit of their beneficiaries during the time they serve on the board. The annual cost per director is $82.80. Directors who contribute to the company's Good Government Fund may designate up to two charities to receive a matching donation from the MDU Resources Foundation based on their contributions to the fund. Directors are reimbursed for all reasonable travel expenses, including spousal expenses in connection with attendance at meetings of the board and its committees. Perquisites, if any, were below the disclosure threshold in 2018.
Deferral of Compensation
Directors may defer all or any portion of the annual cash retainer and any other cash compensation paid for service as a director pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors. Deferred amounts are held as phantom stock with dividend accruals and are paid out in cash over a five-year period after the director leaves the board.
Post-Retirement
Our post-retirement income plan for directors was terminated in May 2001 for current and future directors. The net present value of each director's benefit was calculated and converted into phantom stock. Payment is deferred pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors and will be made in cash over a five-year period after the director's retirement from the board.
Stock Ownership Policy
Our director stock ownership policy contained in our corporate governance guidelines requires each director to own our common stock equal in value to five times the director's annual cash base retainer. Shares acquired through purchases on the open market and received through our Non-Employee Director Long-Term Incentive Plan are considered in ownership calculations as is ownership of our common stock by a spouse. A director is allowed five years commencing January 1 of the year following the year of the director's initial election to the board to meet the requirements. The level of common stock ownership is monitored with an annual report made to the compensation committee of the board. All directors are in compliance with the stock ownership policy or are within the first five years of their election to the board. For further details on our director's stock ownership, see the section entitled "Security Ownership."

ITEM 2. ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION PAID TO THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-21(a), we are asking our stockholders to approve, in an advisory vote, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation committee and board of directors believe that the current executive compensation program directly links compensation of the named executive officers to our financial performance and aligns the interests of the named executive officers with those of our stockholders. The compensation committee and board of directors also believe that the executive compensation program provides the named executive officers with a balanced compensation package that includes an appropriate base salary along with competitive annual and long-term incentive compensation targets. These incentive programs are designed to reward the named executive officers on both an annual and long-term basis if they attain specified goals.
Our overall compensation program and philosophy for 2018 was built on a foundation of these guiding principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we pay for performance, with over 60% of our 2018 total target direct compensation for the named executive officers in the form of performance-based incentive compensation; 
• we review competitive compensation data for the named executive officers, to the extent available, and incorporate internal equity in the final determination of target compensation levels; 
• we align executive compensation and performance by using annual performance incentives based on criteria that are important to stockholder value, including earnings, earnings per share, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); and 
• we align executive compensation and performance by using long-term performance incentives based on total stockholder return relative to our peer group and financial measures important to company growth. 
[END TABLE]
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their approval of our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables, and narrative discussion. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers for 2018. Accordingly, the following resolution is submitted for stockholder vote at the 2019 annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion of this Proxy Statement, is hereby approved."
As this is an advisory vote, the results will not be binding on the company, the board of directors, or the compensation committee and will not require us to take any action. The final decision on the compensation of the named executive officers remains with the compensation committee and the board of directors, although the board and compensation committee will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions. We intend to hold this advisory vote every year until at least the next stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of this vote.

The board of directors recommends a vote "for" the approval, on a non-binding  advisory basis, of the compensation of the company's named executive officers,  as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

Executive Summary
Pay for Performance
To ensure management's interests are aligned with those of our stockholders and the performance of the company, the majority of the CEO's and the other named executive officers' target compensation is dependent on the achievement of company performance targets. The charts below show the target pay mix for the CEO and average target pay mix of the other named executive officers, including base salary and the annual and long-term incentives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  *Includes time-vesting restricted stock units for certain named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Annual Base Salary
We provide our executive officers with base salary at a sufficient level to attract, recruit, and retain executives with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to successfully execute their job responsibilities. Consistent with our compensation philosophy of linking pay to performance, our executives receive a relatively smaller percentage of their overall target compensation in the form of base salary. In establishing base salaries, the compensation committee considers each executive's individual performance, the scope and complexities of their responsibilities, internal equity, and whether the base salary is competitive as measured against the base salaries of similarly situated executives in our peer group and market compensation data.
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   31
Proxy Statement
Annual Cash Incentive Awards
Annual cash incentive awards for our executive officers are linked to performance by rewarding achievement of financial goals and ensuring our executive officers are focused and accountable for our growth and profitability. The design of the annual cash incentive award opportunities for 2018 was the same as the design used in 2017. Each executive is assigned a target annual incentive award based on a percentage of the executive's base salary. The actual annual cash incentive realized is determined by multiplying the target award by the payout percentage associated with achievement of the executive's performance measures.
The compensation committee selected specific business segment financial performance measures for the business segment executives which represented 80% of their annual award opportunity. The other 20% of the business segment executives' annual award opportunity was based on the achievement of overall company earnings per share (EPS). These measures incentivize our business segment executives to focus on the success and performance of their business segment while keeping the overall success of the company in mind.  
The annual cash incentive award for corporate executives (including our CEO and CFO) is based on the achievement of the performance measures for each business segment executive and weighted by each business segment's invested capital relative to the company's total invested capital. The corporate executives' target awards are multiplied by the sum of the weighted achievement percentage for each business segment executive to derive the corporate executives' realized annual awards. This incentivizes the corporate executives to assist the business segments in their success while still emphasizing overall company performance. See the "Annual Incentives" section within this Compensation Discussion and Analysis for further details on our company's annual cash incentive program.
The following chart shows the percentage payout of the annual incentive target realized by our CEO with a comparison to earnings per share from continuing operations for the last five years. The chart demonstrates the alignment between our financial performance and realized annual cash incentive compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
* MDU Resources Group, Inc. reported 2017 earnings from continuing operations of $1.45 per share which included a non-recurring benefit of 20 cents per share attributable to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017.

Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive Awards
Our compensation committee and the board approve grants of long-term incentives to our executives in the form of performance shares which vest into company stock plus dividend equivalents at the end of a three-year performance cycle upon achievement of established performance measures. The following chart depicts the actual vesting percentage for the last five performance cycles and demonstrates the alignment between total stockholder return (TSR) and realized long-term incentive compensation by our executives.
In their February 2018 meeting, the compensation committee and the board approved off-cycle awards to Messrs. Barney and Thiede of time-vesting restricted stock units which will vest on December 31, 2020, if the executives remain employed through the vesting date. The compensation committee believed the restricted stock unit awards incentivize Messrs. Barney and Thiede to continue their employment for the next three years and grow their respective business segments during that time. 
See the "Long-Term Incentives" section within this Compensation Discussion and Analysis for further details on the company's long-term incentive program.
With the majority of our executive officer's compensation dependent on the achievement of performance measures set by the compensation committee, we believe there is substantial alignment between executive pay and the company's performance.
Stockholder Advisory Vote ("Say on Pay")
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 95.9% of the votes cast on the "Say on Pay" proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers. The compensation committee viewed the 2018 vote as an expression of the stockholders general satisfaction with the company's executive compensation programs. The compensation committee reviewed and considered the 2018 vote on "Say on Pay" in setting compensation for 2019 by continuing to link performance-based annual and long-term incentives to company financial performance and stockholder value.

þ Long-Term Equity Incentive - The long-term performance-based equity incentive in the form of performance shares represents approximately 56% of our CEO's and approximately 37% of our other named executive officers' 2018 target compensation, which may only be earned based on achievement of established performance measures at the end of a three-year period. 
þ Annual Compensation Risk Analysis - We regularly analyze the risks related to our compensation programs and conduct an annual broad risk assessment.

2018 Compensation Framework
Objectives of our Compensation Program 
We have a written executive compensation policy for our executive officers, including all the named executive officers. Our policy's stated objectives are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recruit, motivate, reward, and retain high performing executive talent required to create superior long-term total stockholder return in comparison to our peer group; 
• reward executives for short-term performance, as well as for growth in enterprise value over the long-term; 
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a competitive compensation package relative to industry-specific and general industry comparisons and internal equity; 
• ensure effective utilization and development of talent by working in concert with other management processes - for example, performance appraisal, succession planning, and management development; and 
• ensure that compensation programs do not encourage or reward excessive or imprudent risk taking. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Decision Process for 2018 
For 2018, the compensation committee made recommendations to the board of directors regarding compensation of all executive officers, and the board of directors then approved the recommendations. The CEO's role in the process includes the assessment of executive officer performance and recommending base salaries for the executive officers other than himself. The CEO attended all compensation committee meetings but was not present during discussions of his compensation. The compensation committee established and approved base salaries and performance measures for the annual and long-term incentive compensation for 2018. They also certified the achievement of performance measures in 2017 associated with annual and long-term incentive compensation. 
At least every two years, the compensation committee hires an independent consulting firm to assess and recommend competitive pay levels, including base salaries and incentive compensation, associated with executive officer positions. Typically the consulting firm conducts its analysis in even numbered years. In odd numbered years, the assessment is performed by the company's human resources department using a variety of industry specific sources. In August 2017, the company's human resources department prepared the analysis of and provided recommendations for the 2018 compensation structure.  
Components of Compensation
The components of our executive officer's compensation are selected to drive financial and operational results as well as align the executive officer's interests with those of our stockholders. The components of our executive compensation include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Component Payments Purpose   How Determined   How it Links to Performance 
Base Salary Assured Provides sufficient, regularly paid income to recruit and retain executives with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to successfully execute their job responsibilities.   Based on recommendation from the CEO for executives other than himself and analysis of peer company and industry compensation information.   Base salary is a means to attract and retain talented executives capable of driving success and performance. 
Annual Cash Incentive Performance Based   At RiskProvides an opportunity to earn annual incentive compensation to ensure focus on annual financial results and to be competitive from a total renumeration standpoint.   Annual cash incentives are calculated as a percentage of base salary with payout based on the achievement of performance measures established in advance by the compensation committee.   Annual incentive performance measures are tied to the achievement of financial goals aimed to drive the success of the company and the individual business segments.

Performance Shares  Performance Based   At RiskProvides an opportunity to earn long-term compensation to ensure focus on stockholder return and to be competitive from a total renumeration standpoint.   Performance share award opportunities are calculated as a percentage of base salary with vesting based on the company's achievement of financial measures established by the compensation committee as well as total stockholder return in comparison to the company's peer group over a three-year performance cycle.   Fosters ownership in company stock and aligns the executive's interests with those of stockholders in increasing stockholder value. 
Restricted Stock Units Time Vested Provides an opportunity to earn long-term compensation to promote retention of executive talent, focus on long-term business segment growth, and to be competitive from a total renumeration standpoint.   Restricted stock unit awards are determined by the compensation committee and vest at the end of a three-year period if the executive remains employed by the company.   Fosters ownership in company stock and incentivizes executives to remain employed with the company while aligning the executive's interests with those of the stockholder in increasing stockholder value.

Allocation of Total Target Compensation for 2018 
Total target compensation consists of base salary plus target annual and long-term incentive compensation. Performance-based incentive compensation, which consists of annual cash incentive and three-year performance share award opportunities, comprises the largest portion of our named executive officers' total target compensation because:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our named executive officers are in positions to drive, and therefore bear high levels of responsibility for, our corporate performance; 
• incentive compensation is dependent upon our performance; 
• incentive compensation helps ensure focus on performance measures that are aligned with our overall strategy; and 
• the interests of the named executive officers are aligned with those of stockholders by making a significant portion of their target compensation contingent upon results beneficial to stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
To foster and reward long-term growth, the compensation committee generally allocates a higher percentage of total target compensation to the target long-term incentive than to the target annual incentive for our higher level executives because they are in a better position to influence long-term performance. The long-term incentive awards, if earned by achieving established measures, are paid in company common stock. These awards, combined with our stock retention requirements and our stock ownership policy, promote ownership of our stock by the executive officers. The compensation committee believes the executive officers, as stockholders, will be motivated to deliver results that build value for all stockholders over the long term.
Peer Group
The compensation committee evaluates the company's compensation plan and its performance relative to a group of peer companies in determining compensation and the vesting of long-term incentive compensation. The companies included in our peer group are evaluated every year and are selected as representatives of the industries in which we operate. The 2018 peer group includes twelve companies in regulated energy delivery businesses, and eight companies in the construction materials or construction services businesses. In determining the 2018 peer group, we removed five companies, namely Avista Corporation, National Fuel Gas Company, IES Holdings, Inc., Quanta Services, Inc., and Sterling Construction Company, Inc., due to size, industry focus, or pending merger. Companies added to the 2018 peer group were Otter Tail Corporation, Portland General Electric Company, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., Spire, Inc., MasTec, Inc., and Summit Materials, Inc. due to their industry focus, relative size, and geographic location. The following chart depicts the companies in our 2018 peer group.

Annual Incentives 
Annual incentive awards are determined for business segment executives by the achievement of specific performance measures selected by the compensation committee including financial performance measures specific to each business segment and a performance measure tied to overall company earnings per share. For corporate executives, annual incentive awards are determined as the sum of a weighted percentage award payout of each business segment based upon achievement of its performance measures. Percentage award payouts for the business segments are weighted by the business segment's invested capital relative to the company's total invested capital. Through this, our business segment executives are incentivized to primarily focus on the success and performance of their business segment while keeping the overall financial success of the company in mind, whereas our corporate executives are incentivized to assist in the success and performance of all lines of business. 
The compensation committee considered and selected objective financial performance measures to ensure that compensation to the executives reflects the success of their respective business segments and the company as well as value provided to our stockholders. Each business segment president's annual incentive performance measures include a corporate earnings per share performance measure representing 20% of the target award opportunity and a business segment financial performance measure representing 80% of the target award opportunity. The following annual incentive performance measures for 2018 were adopted by the compensation committee for the business segment presidents (exclusive of the MDU Resources Group, Inc. corporate executive officers) at its February 2018 meeting:

Long-Term Incentives 
Long-term incentive compensation comprises approximately 56% of the CEO's 2018 total target direct compensation and 48% of the average of the other named executive officer's target total direct compensation. Stock earned under long-term incentive compensation is subject to our stock retention requirements. If the executive's employment is terminated during the performance period for cause at any time, or for any reason other than cause before the executive has reached age 55 and completed ten years of service, all performance shares and related dividend equivalents are forfeited. Restricted stock units are forfeited or canceled if the executive ceases to be an employee of the company or an affiliate except for employment termination due to death, disability, or change of control.

Grant of 2018-2020 Long-Term Performance Share Awards
For 2018, the compensation committee approved performance share awards which may vest at the end of a three-year period between 0% and 200% based on the achievement of three performance measures:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total stockholder return relative to that of the peer group companies represents 50% of the award and was selected to align the award with the company's performance relative to our peers;  
• Compound annual growth rate in earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (EBITDA) represents 25% of the award which encourages strategic growth and focuses on controllable costs; and 
• Compound annual growth rate in earnings from continuing operations represents 25% of the award which encourages quality earnings and continued growth of the company. 
[END TABLE]
For the awards made in 2018, the compensation committee added the EBITDA and earnings growth measures to incentivize participants to focus on company growth in addition to total stockholder return during the performance period. Earnings used to calculate EBITDA growth and earnings growth will be adjusted for (i) the effect on earnings from losses on asset sales/dispositions approved by the board; (ii) the effect on earnings from withdrawal liabilities relating to multiemployer pension plans; and (iii) the effect on earnings from transaction costs for completed acquisitions or mergers. 
On February 15, 2018, for the 2018-2020 performance period, the compensation committee determined the target number of performance shares for each named executive officer by multiplying the named executive officer's 2018 base salary by a target long-term incentive percentage and then dividing by the average of the closing prices of our stock from January 1 through January 22, 2018, which was $26.27 per share. Based on this price, the board of directors, upon recommendation of the compensation committee, awarded the following target performance share opportunities to the named executive officers:

For the 2016-2018 performance period, the long-term incentive program consisted solely of performance shares. The performance criteria used for the 2016-2018 performance period was total stockholder return as a percentile of the total stockholder return for our peer companies. Our total stockholder return ranking over the performance period was at the 60th percentile which resulted in vesting at 140% of the target performance shares and dividend equivalents.

401(k) Retirement Plan
The named executive officers as well as all employees working a minimum of 1,000 hours per year are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan and defer annual income up to the IRS limit. The company provides a match up to 3% depending on the employee's elected deferral rate. Contributions and the company match are invested in various funds based on the employee's election including company common stock. 
In 2010, the company began offering increased company contributions to our 401(k) plan in lieu of pension plan contributions. For non-bargaining unit employees hired after 2006 or employees who were not previously participants in the pension plan, the added retirement contribution is 5% of plan eligible compensation. For non-bargaining unit employees hired prior to 2006 who were participants in the pension plan, the added retirement contributions are based on the employee's age as of December 31, 2009. The retirement contribution is 11.5% for Mr. Goodin, 9.0% for Ms. Kivisto, 7.0% for Mr. Vollmer, and 5.0% for Messrs. Barney and Thiede. These amounts may be reduced in accordance with the provisions of the 401(k) plan to ensure compliance with IRS limits.  
Pension Plans
Effective in 2006, the defined benefit pension plans were closed to new non-bargaining unit employees and as of December 31, 2009, the defined benefit plans were frozen. For further details regarding the company's pension plans, please refer to the section entitled "Pension Benefits for 2018."
Supplemental Income Security Plan
We offered certain key managers and executives benefits under a nonqualified retirement plan, referred to as the Supplemental Income Security Plan (SISP). The SISP provides participants with additional retirement income and death benefits. Effective February 11, 2016, the SISP was amended to exclude new participants to the plan and freeze current benefit levels for existing participants. For further details regarding the company's SISP, please refer to the section entitled "Pension Benefits for 2018." Named executive officers participating in the SISP are Messrs. Goodin, Barney, and Ms. Kivisto.

Employment and Severance Agreements
We currently do not have employment or severance agreements with our executives entitling them to specific payments upon termination of employment or a change of control of the company. The compensation committee generally considers providing severance benefits on a case-by-case basis. Any post-employment or change of control benefits available to our executives are addressed within our incentive and retirement plans. Please refer to the section entitled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control."
Compensation Governance
Impact of Tax and Accounting Treatment
The compensation committee may consider the impact of tax and/or accounting treatment in determining compensation. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of certain compensation to $1 million paid to certain officers as a business expense in any tax year. The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), signed into law in December 2017, expanded the number of individuals covered by the Section 162(m) deductibility limit and repealed the exception for performance-based compensation, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Incentive compensation approved by the compensation committee prior to Tax Reform for our CEO and those executive officers whose overall compensation was likely to exceed $1 million was generally structured to meet the requirements for the performance-based exception for deductibility for purposes of Section 162(m). As a result of Tax Reform, compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible, unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
The compensation committee also considers the accounting and cash flow implications of various forms of executive compensation. We expense salaries and annual incentive compensation as earned. For our equity awards, we record the accounting expense in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board 718, which is generally expensed over the vesting period.

We provide executives the opportunity to defer receipt of earned annual incentives. If an executive chooses to defer all or part of an annual incentive, we credit the deferral with interest at a rate determined by the compensation committee. For 2018, the compensation committee chose an interest rate of 4.28% based on an average of the Moody's U.S. Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average for "A" and "Baa" rated companies. The compensation committee's reasons for using this interest rate recognized incentive deferrals are a low-cost source of capital for the company and are unsecured obligations and, therefore, carry a higher risk to the executives. 
Clawback 
In February 2016, we amended our Long-Term Performance-Based Incentive Plan and Executive Incentive Compensation Plan sections regarding the repayment of incentive compensation due to accounting restatements, commonly referred to as a clawback policy. The compensation committee may, or shall if required, take action to recover incentive-based compensation from specific executives in the event the company is required to restate its financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws. 
Policy Regarding Hedging Stock Ownership
Our executive compensation policy prohibits executive officers, which includes our named executive officers, from hedging their ownership of company common stock. Executives may not enter into transactions that allow the executive to benefit from devaluation of our stock or otherwise own stock technically but without the full benefits and risks of such ownership. See the section entitled "Security Ownership" for our policy on margin accounts and pledging of our stock.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Regulation S-K, 
Item 402(b), with management. Based on the review and discussions referred to in the preceding sentence, the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A.

Narrative Discussion Relating to the Summary Compensation Table  and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table
Annual Incentive
The compensation committee recommended the 2018 annual incentive award opportunities for our named executive officers and the board approved these opportunities at its meeting on February 15, 2018. The award opportunities at threshold, target, and maximum are reflected in columns (c), (d), and (e), respectively, of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The actual amount paid with respect to 2018 performance is reflected in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table. 
As described in the "Annual Incentives" section of the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," payment of annual award opportunities is dependent upon achievement of performance measures; actual payout may range from 0% to 200% of the target except for the construction materials and contracting and construction services segments which may range from 0% to 240%. 
All our named executive officers were awarded their annual incentive opportunities pursuant to the MDU Resources Group, Inc. Executive Incentive Compensation Plan. Under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, executives who retire during the year at or after age 65 remain eligible to receive an award, but executives who terminate employment for other reasons are not eligible for an award. The compensation committee generally does not modify the performance measures; however, if major unforeseen changes in economic and environmental conditions or other significant factors beyond the control of management substantially affected management's ability to achieve the specified performance measures, the compensation committee, in consultation with the CEO, may modify the performance measures. The compensation committee has full discretion to determine the extent to which goals have been achieved, the payment level, and whether to adjust payment of awards downward based upon individual performance. For further discussion of the specific 2018 incentive plan performance measures and results, see the "Annual Incentives" section in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Long-Term Incentive
The compensation committee recommended long-term incentive award opportunities for the named executive officers in the form of performance shares, and the board approved the award opportunities at its meeting on February 15, 2018. The long-term incentive opportunities are presented as the number of performance shares at threshold, target, and maximum in columns (f), (g), and (h) of the 
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   47
Proxy Statement
Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The value of the long-term performance-based incentive opportunities is based on the aggregate grant date fair value and is reflected in column (e) of the Summary Compensation Table and column (l) of the Grant of Plan-Based Awards Table.
Depending on the achievement of the performance measures associated with our 2018-2020 performance period, executives will receive from 0% to 200% of the target awards in February 2021. We also will pay dividend equivalents in cash on the number of shares actually vested for the performance period. The dividend equivalents will be paid in 2021 at the same time as the performance share awards are issued.
The compensation committee also awarded Messrs. Barney and Thiede each 11,419 restricted stock units on February 15, 2018, which will vest on December 31, 2020 if the officers remain employees of the company through the vesting date as reflected in column (i) of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The compensation committee believes the restricted stock unit awards will incentivize Messrs. Barney and Thiede to continue their employment with the company for the next three years and grow their respective business segments during that time. For further discussion of the specific long-term incentive plan, see the "Long-Term Incentives" section in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan
The CEO recommends participants and contribution amounts to the Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan which are approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors. The purpose of the plan is to recognize outstanding performance coupled with enhanced retention as the Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan requires a vesting period. The amount shown in column (i) - All Other Compensation of the Summary Compensation Table includes contributions of $35,000 to Mr. Vollmer, $150,000 to Mr. Barney, and $100,000 to Mr. Thiede. For further information, see the section entitled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018."

[END TABLE]
The amounts shown for the pension plan, Basic SISP, and Excess SISP represent the actuarial present values of the executives' accumulated benefits accrued as of December 31, 2018, calculated using:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a 3.85% discount rate for the Basic SISP and Excess SISP; 
• a 4.01% discount rate for the pension plan; 
• the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 Mortality Table with scale MP-2018 for post-retirement mortality; and 
• no recognition of future salary increases or pre-retirement mortality.  
[END TABLE]
50   MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   
Proxy Statement
The actuary assumed a retirement age of 60 for the pension, Basic SISP, and Excess SISP benefits and assumed retirement benefits commence at age 60 for the pension and Excess SISP and age 65 for Basic SISP benefits. 
Pension Plan
The MDU Resources Group, Inc. Pension Plan for Non-Bargaining Unit Employees (pension plan) applies to employees hired before 2006 and was amended to cease benefit accruals as of December 31, 2009. The benefits under the pension plan are based on a participant's average annual salary over the 60 consecutive month period where the participant received the highest annual salary between 1999 and 2009. Benefits are paid as straight life annuities for single participants and as actuarially reduced annuities with a survivor benefit for married participants unless they choose otherwise.
Supplemental Income Security Plan 
The Supplemental Income Security Plan (SISP), a defined benefit nonqualified retirement plan, is offered to select key managers and executives. SISP benefits are determined by reference to levels defined within the plan. Our compensation committee, after receiving recommendations from our CEO, determined each participant's level within the plan. On February 11, 2016, the SISP was amended to exclude new participants to the plan and freeze current benefit levels for existing participants.
Basic SISP Benefits
Basic SISP is a supplemental retirement benefit intended to augment the retirement income provided under the pension plans. The Basic SISP benefits are subject to the following ten-year vesting schedule:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 0% vesting for less than three years of participation; 
• 20% vesting for three years of participation; 
• 40% vesting for four years of participation; and 
• an additional 10% vesting for each additional year of participation up to 100% vesting for ten years of participation. 
[END TABLE]
Participants can elect to receive the Basic SISP as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• monthly retirement benefits only; 
• monthly death benefits paid to a beneficiary only; or 
• a combination of retirement and death benefits, where each benefit is reduced proportionately. 
[END TABLE]
Regardless of the election, if the participant dies before the SISP retirement benefit commences, only the SISP death benefit is provided.
Excess SISP Benefits
Excess SISP is an additional retirement benefit relating to Internal Revenue Code limitations on retirement benefits provided under the pension plans. Excess SISP benefits are equal to the difference between the monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable to the participant under the pension plans absent the limitations under the Internal Revenue Code and the actual benefits payable to the participant under the pension plans. Participants are only eligible for the Excess SISP benefits if the participant is fully vested under the pension plan, their employment terminates prior to age 65, and benefits under the pension plan are reduced due to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code on plan compensation. 
In 2009, the SISP was amended to limit eligibility for the Excess SISP benefit. Mr. Goodin is the only named executive officer eligible for the Excess SISP benefit and must remain employed with the company until age 60 in order to receive the benefit. Benefits generally commence six months after the participant's employment terminates and continue to age 65 or until the death of the participant, if prior to age 65. 
Both Basic and Excess SISP benefits are forfeited if the participant's employment is terminated for cause.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018 
Deferred Annual Incentive Compensation
Executives participating in the annual incentive compensation plans may elect to defer up to 100% of their annual incentive awards. Deferred amounts accrue interest at a rate determined annually by the compensation committee. The interest rate in effect for 2018 was 4.28% based on an average of the Moody's U.S. Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average for "A" and "Baa" rated companies. The deferred amount will be paid in accordance with the participant's election, following termination of employment or beginning in the fifth year following the year the award was earned. The amounts are paid in accordance with the participant's election in either a lump sum or in 
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   51
Proxy Statement
monthly installments not to exceed 120 months. In the event of a change of control, all amounts deferred would immediately become payable. For purposes of deferred annual incentive compensation, a change of control is defined as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an acquisition during a 12-month period of 30% or more of the total voting power of our stock; 
• an acquisition of our stock that, together with stock already held by the acquirer, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of our stock; 
• replacement of a majority of the members of our board of directors during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of our board of directors; or 
• acquisition of our assets having a gross fair market value at least equal to 40% of the gross fair market value of all of our assets. 
[END TABLE]
Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan
The company adopted the Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan, effective January 1, 2012, to provide deferred compensation for a select group of employees. The compensation committee approves the amount of employer contributions under the Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan and the obligations under the plan constitute an unsecured promise of the company to make such payments. The company credits contributions to plan accounts which capture the hypothetical investment experience based on the participant's elections. Contributions made prior to 2017 vest four years after each contribution in accordance with the terms of the plan. Contributions made in 2017 vest rateably over a three-year period with 1/3 vesting after the first year, an additional 1/3 after the second year, and the final 1/3 after the third year. Amounts shown as aggregate earnings in the table below for Messrs. Vollmer, Barney, and Thiede reflect the change in investment value at market rates for the hypothetical investments selected by the participants. Participants may elect to receive their vested contributions and investment earnings either in a lump sum upon separation from service with the company or in annual installments over a period of years upon the later of (i) separation from service and (ii) age 65. Plan benefits become fully vested if the participant dies while actively employed. Benefits are forfeited if the participant's employment is terminated for cause.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
The Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control Table shows the payments and benefits our named executive officers would receive in connection with a variety of employment termination scenarios or upon a change of control. The scenarios include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voluntary Termination 
• Not for Cause Termination 
• Death 
• Disability 
• Change of Control with Termination 
• Change of Control without Termination. 
[END TABLE]
52   MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   
Proxy Statement
For the named executive officers, the information assumes the terminations or the change of control occurred on December 31, 2018. 
The table excludes compensation and benefits our named executive officers would earn during their employment with us whether or not a termination or change of control event had occurred. The tables also do not include benefits under plans or arrangements generally available to all salaried employees and that do not discriminate in favor of the named executive officers, such as benefits under our qualified defined benefit pension plan (for employees hired before 2006), accrued vacation pay, continuation of health care benefits, and life insurance benefits. The tables also do not include Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan or deferred annual compensation amounts which are shown and explained in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018 Table.    
Compensation
None of our named executive officers have employment or severance agreements entitling them to their base salary, some multiple of base salary or severance upon termination or change of control. Our compensation committee generally considers providing severance benefits on a case-by-case basis. Because severance payments are discretionary, no amounts are presented in the tables. 
All our named executive officers were granted their 2018 annual incentive award under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (EICP) which has no change of control provision in regards to annual incentive compensation other than for deferred compensation. The EICP requires participants to remain employed with the company through the service year to be eligible for a payout unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee for named executive officers, or employment termination after age 65. As all our scenarios assume a termination or change in control event on December 31st, the named executives officers would be considered employed for the entire performance period; therefore, no amounts are shown for annual incentives in the tables for our named executive officers, as they would be eligible to receive their annual incentive award based on the level that performance measures were achieved for the performance period regardless of termination or change of control occurring on December 31, 2018.     
All named executive officers received their performance share awards under the Long-Term Performance-Based Incentive Plan (LTIP). Upon a change of control (with or without termination), performance share awards would be deemed fully earned and vest at their target levels for the named executive officers. For this purpose, the term "change of control" is defined in the LTIP as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by an individual, entity, or group of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock; 
• a majority of our board of directors whose election or nomination was not approved by a majority of the incumbent board members; 
• consummation of a merger or similar transaction or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, unless our stockholders immediately prior to the transaction beneficially own more than 60% of the outstanding common stock and voting power of the resulting corporation in substantially the same proportions as before the merger, no person owns 20% or more of the resulting corporation's outstanding common stock or voting power except for any such ownership that existed before the merger and at least a majority of the board of the resulting corporation is comprised of our directors; or 
• stockholder approval of our liquidation or dissolution.

For termination scenarios other than a change of control, our award agreements provide that performance share awards are forfeited if the participant's employment terminates before the participant has reached age 55 and completed 10 years of service. If a participant's employment is terminated other than for cause after reaching age 55 and completing 10 years of service, performance shares are prorated as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• termination of employment during the first year of the performance period = shares are forfeited; 
• termination of employment during the second year of the performance period = performance shares earned are prorated based on the number of months employed during the performance period; and 
• termination of employment during the third year of the performance period = full amount of any performance shares earned are received. 
[END TABLE]
Under the termination scenarios, Messrs. Goodin, Barney, and Thiede would receive performance shares as they have each reached age 55 and have 10 or more years of service. The number of performance shares received would be based on the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2016-2018 performance shares would vest based on the achievement of the performance measure for the period ended December 31, 2018, which was 140%; 
• 2017-2019 performance shares would be prorated at 24 out of 36 months (2/3) of the performance period and vest based on the achievement of the performance measure for the period ended December 31, 2019. For purposes of the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control Table, the vesting is shown at 100%; and 
• 2018-2020 performance shares would be forfeited.

Proxy Statement
For purposes of calculating the performance share value shown in the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control Table, the number of vesting shares was multiplied by the average of the high and low stock price for the last market day of the year, which was December 31, 2018. Dividend equivalents based on the number of vesting shares are also included in the amounts presented.
Neither Ms. Kivisto nor Mr. Vollmer have reached age 55; therefore, they are not eligible for vesting of performance shares in the event of their termination. 
Messrs. Barney and Thiede were granted 11,419 restricted stock units in February 2018. The restricted stock units will vest on December 31, 2020 provided that Messrs. Barney and Thiede remain continuously employed by the company through December 31, 2020, except for termination due to death or disability or a change in control as defined in the LTIP. In the case of a voluntary or not for cause termination on December 31, 2018, Messrs Barney and Thiede would forfeit the restricted stock units. In the case of death or disability, the restricted stock units would vest based on the number of full months of employment completed during the grant period to the date of death or disability divided by the total number of months in the grant period. In the case of death or disability occurring on December 31, 2018, one-third of Messrs. Barney and Thiede's restricted stock units plus dividend equivalents would vest. In the case of a change of control (with or without termination) occurring on December 31, 2018, the restricted stock units plus dividend equivalents would fully vest.   
Benefits and Perquisites
Supplemental Income Security Plan
As described in the "Pension Benefits for 2018" section, the Basis SISP provides a benefit of payments commencing at age 65 and payable for 15 years. Of the named executive officers, only Messrs. Goodin, Barney, and Ms. Kivisto participate in the Basic SISP benefits. While Messrs. Goodin and Barney are 100% vested in their SISP benefit, Ms. Kivisto entered the plan in 2011 and is only 80% vested in her SISP benefit at December 31, 2018. Ms. Kivisto received a benefit level upgrade in 2014, which cliff vests on January 1, 2021. This means that if her employment terminates for any reason other than death before January 1, 2021, her benefit upgrade is forfeited. 
Under all scenarios except death and change of control without termination, the payment represents the present value of the vested Basic SISP benefit as of December 31, 2018 using the monthly retirement benefit shown in the table below and a discount rate of 3.85%. In the event of death, Messrs. Goodin, Barney, and Ms. Kivisto's beneficiaries would receive monthly death benefit payments for 15 years. The Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control Table shows the present value calculations of the monthly death benefit using the 3.85% discount rate.

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of David L. Goodin, our president and chief executive officer, to the annual total compensation of our median employee. 
Our employee workforce fluctuates during the year largely depending on the seasonality, number, and size of construction project activity conducted by our businesses. Approximately 49.6% of our employee workforce is employed under union bargained labor contracts which define compensation and benefits for participants which may include payments made by the company associated with employee participation in union benefit and pension plans.   
We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 taxable wage information for all individuals on the company's payroll records as of December 31, 2018, excluding Mr. Goodin and the employees of Sweetman Construction Company which was acquired by our Construction Materials and Contracting segment during the fourth quarter. Because of the timing of this acquisition and its integration, payroll records were not available to include in the pay ratio analysis. Sweetman Construction Company reported 232 employees which represents less than 2% of the company's employee population.  All of the company's employees are located in the United States. We made no adjustments to annualize compensation for individuals employed for only part of the year. We selected taxable wages as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2018 to identify the median employee as it includes substantially all of the compensation for our median employee and provided a reasonably efficient and economic manner for the identification of the median employee. Our median employee works for our corporate office with annual compensation consisting of wages, annual incentive and company matching, retirement replacement and profit sharing 401(k) contributions. Our median employee does not participate in the company's pension plan since our median employee joined the company in 2017, after the plan was frozen. Our median employee receives an additional 5% company match to his 401(k) plan in lieu of pension contributions.
Once identified, we categorized the median employee's compensation to correspond to the compensation components as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. For 2018, the total annual compensation of Mr. Goodin as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement was $4,124,067, and the total annual compensation of our median employee was $77,268. Based on this information, the 2018 ratio of annual total compensation of Mr. Goodin to the median employee was 53 to 1.

ITEM 3:  RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
The audit committee at its February 2019 meeting appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. The board of directors concurred with the audit committee's decision. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since fiscal year 2002.
Although your ratification vote will not affect the appointment or retention of Deloitte & Touche LLP for 2019, the audit committee will consider your vote in determining its appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the next fiscal year. The audit committee, in appointing our independent registered public accounting firm, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change an appointment at any time during a fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests.
A representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the annual meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. We do not anticipate that the representative will make a prepared statement at the annual meeting; however, he or she will be free to do so if he or she chooses.
[BEGIN TABLE]
The board of directors recommends a vote "for" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will count as votes against this proposal.
Annual Evaluation and Selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP
The audit committee annually evaluates the performance of its independent registered public accounting firm, including the senior audit engagement team, and determines whether to re-engage the current independent accounting firm or consider other firms. Factors considered by the audit committee in deciding whether to retain the current independent accounting firm include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte & Touche LLP's capabilities considering the complexity of our business and the resulting demands placed on Deloitte & Touche LLP in terms of technical expertise and knowledge of our industry and business; 
• the quality and candor of Deloitte & Touche LLP's communications with the audit committee and management; 
• Deloitte & Touche LLP's independence; 
• the quality and efficiency of the services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP, including input from management on Deloitte & Touche LLP's performance and how effectively Deloitte & Touche LLP demonstrated its independent judgment, objectivity, and professional skepticism; 
• external data on audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board reports on Deloitte & Touche LLP and its peer firms; and 
• the appropriateness of Deloitte & Touche LLP's fees, tenure as our independent auditor, including the benefits of a longer tenure, and the controls and processes in place that help ensure Deloitte & Touche LLP's continued independence. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this evaluation, the audit committee and the board believe that retaining Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, is in the best interests of our company and its stockholders.
In accordance with rules applicable to mandatory partner rotation, Deloitte & Touche LLP's lead engagement partner for our audit was changed in 2017. The audit committee oversees the process for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the lead engagement partner.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The audit committee pre-approved all services Deloitte & Touche LLP performed in 2018 in accordance with the pre-approval policy and procedures the audit committee adopted in 2003. This policy is designed to achieve the continued independence of Deloitte & Touche LLP and to assist in our compliance with Sections 201 and 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the SEC.
The policy defines the permitted services in each of the audit, audit-related, tax, and all other services categories, as well as prohibited services. The pre-approval policy requires management to submit annually for approval to the audit committee a service plan describing the scope of work and anticipated cost associated with each category of service. At each regular audit committee meeting, management reports on services performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP and the fees paid or accrued through the end of the quarter preceding the meeting. Management may submit requests for additional permitted services before the next scheduled audit committee meeting to the designated member of the audit committee, Dennis W. Johnson, for approval. The designated member updates the audit committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting regarding any services approved during the interim period. At each regular audit committee meeting, management may submit to the audit committee for approval a supplement to the service plan containing any request for additional permitted services.
In addition, prior to approving any request for audit-related, tax, or all other services of more than $50,000, Deloitte & Touche LLP will provide a statement setting forth the reasons why rendering of the proposed services does not compromise Deloitte & Touche LLP's independence. This description and statement by Deloitte & Touche LLP may be incorporated into the service plan or included as an exhibit thereto or may be delivered in a separate written statement.

OTHER MATTERS         
[END TABLE]
ITEM 4. APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO MONTANA-DAKOTA UTILITIES CO.'S RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
General
On January 1, 2019, we completed a holding company reorganization pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") to provide additional financing flexibility and further separation between our utility companies and other businesses (the "Reorganization"). As a result of the Reorganization, Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., formerly known as MDU Resources Group, Inc. ("Montana-Dakota"), became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new public holding company (the "Company").
As required by Section 251(g) of the DGCL, Montana-Dakota's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended in connection with the Reorganization (the "Montana-Dakota Charter"), provides that any act or transaction involving Montana-Dakota, other than the election or removal of directors, that requires for its adoption under the DGCL or the Montana-Dakota Charter the approval of the stockholders of Montana-Dakota will also require the approval of the Company's stockholders by the same vote as is required by the DGCL and the Montana-Dakota Charter (the "Pass-Through Provision"). Absent a provision like the Pass-Through Provision, there is no general requirement under Delaware law that stockholders of a parent entity vote on transactions involving the parent entity's wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Accordingly, the Pass-Through Provision permits stockholders of the Company, the public holding company, to have direct voting rights as to matters affecting the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Montana-Dakota, that would otherwise only require the approval of Montana-Dakota's sole stockholder. This is highly unusual for a public holding company and restricts the Company's flexibility to realize the desired effects of the Reorganization.
For example, the Pass-Through Provision would require Montana-Dakota to obtain approval from the Company's stockholders, in addition to obtaining the approval of Montana-Dakota's sole stockholder, prior to making amendments to the Montana-Dakota Charter. As was required by Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the Montana-Dakota Charter is substantially identical to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as currently in effect, with the exception of the Pass-Through Provision and certain amendments that are permissible and/or required under Section 251(g) of the DGCL. However, now that the Company is the public holding company, certain amendments to the Montana-Dakota Charter are desired in order to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary provisions in the Montana-Dakota Charter, including many provisions that are not typical or relevant for a wholly-owned subsidiary. 
The deletion of the Pass-Through Provision will put the Company in the same position as substantially all other public holding companies that operate through multiple subsidiaries. It is uncommon in business organizations that operate in a holding company structure for the stockholders of the holding company to have direct voting rights as to matters that affect only subsidiaries of the holding company. Obtaining consent from a public corporation's stockholders for such internal matters would add significant expense and delay and prevent the Company from achieving the flexibility and efficiency it sought to achieve by implementing the holding company structure. By removing this requirement, the Company will gain the flexibility and efficiency currently realized by nearly all other companies who operate under the same, or similar, holding company and subsidiary structure. Specifically, the removal of the Pass-Through Provision will allow Montana-Dakota to implement further amendments to the Montana-Dakota Charter to eliminate duplicative and inapplicable charter provisions that are no longer reflective of our current holding company structure. The removal of the Pass-Through Provision would also allow Montana-Dakota's sole stockholder, without a special vote of the Company's stockholders for each amendment, to adopt amendments to the Montana-Dakota Charter such as those more typically found in the charters of wholly-owned subsidiaries whose shares are not listed for trading on any stock exchange. 
The board believes that the deletion of the Pass-Through Provision will provide the Company with the flexibility to manage its organization under the holding company structure more efficiently and effectively. Our board therefore seeks approval from the Company's stockholders to amend the Montana-Dakota Charter in order to remove the Pass-Through Provision. 
The Pass-Through Provision that would be eliminated by the proposed amendment reads as follows:
Any act or transaction by or involving the Corporation, other than the election or removal of directors of the Corporation, that requires for its adoption under the General Corporation Law of Delaware or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation shall, in accordance with Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, require, in addition, the approval of the stockholders of MDU Resources Group, Inc. (or any successor thereto by merger), by the same vote as is required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware and/or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
60   MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   
Proxy Statement
Impact on Stockholder Rights
Removing the Pass-Through Provision from the Montana-Dakota Charter would have no effect on the right of stockholders of the Company to vote on matters relating to the Company, such as elections of directors, a merger or consolidation of the Company, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, amendments to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or any other acts or transactions requiring the approval of the Company stockholders under applicable law. If the proposed amendment is approved by the Company's stockholders and effected, then the pass-through voting requirement at Montana-Dakota would be eliminated, and the Company would no longer be required to obtain the additional approval of the Company's stockholders for acts or transactions by or involving Montana-Dakota in the manner currently required by the Pass-Through Provision.
Required Vote
Approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares of our common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes will count as votes against this proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
The board of directors recommends a vote "for" the approval of the adoption of amendment of the Montana-Dakota charter to remove the pass-through provision. 
[END TABLE]
ITEM 5. APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO UPDATE AND MODERNIZE THE COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, INCLUDING REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT OF ACTION BY A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF CONTINUING DIRECTORS FOR CERTAIN BOARD ACTIONS
The company's predecessor was incorporated in 1924, and its certificate of incorporation has been amended numerous times during the company's long corporate existence. The board believes the current amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the "current certificate") contains many outdated provisions and references that are no longer necessary or consistent with the company's present situation or modern certificates of incorporation generally, including language requiring action by two-thirds of the company's "continuing directors" for certain board actions.
The board of directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to amend and restate the current certificate to update and modernize certain of its provisions, including as follows (with further discussion below):
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Removing Requirement of Action by a Two-Thirds Vote of Continuing Directors for Certain Board Actions. Revise language requiring action by two-thirds of the company's continuing directors for certain board actions and instead require action by a simple majority of the board for those actions. 
• Updating Capital Stock Provisions, Including "Blank Check" Preferred Stock. Update the company's capital stock provisions, including those relating to the preferred and preference stock, to a more standard structure and formulation for "blank check" preferred stock; and remove references to certain classes and previous series of preferred and preference stock which are no longer relevant to the company. 
• Modernizing Corporate Purpose and Director Powers and Duties Language. Modernize provisions relating to the corporate purpose of the company and the powers and duties of the company's board of directors to be more customary and consistent with Delaware law. 
• Housekeeping Revisions. Make other immaterial, non-substantive and ministerial changes, including reorganizing and renumbering certain provisions; correcting various references to statutes, names and dates; and deleting, consolidating and updating provisions to be consistent with Delaware law. 
[END TABLE]
The board of directors has approved, and recommends the company's stockholders approve, these proposed amendments to and restatement of the current certificate (as amended and restated, the "revised certificate"). A copy of the revised certificate reflecting these proposed amendments is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. Additions to and reorganization of text of our current certificate are indicated by underlining, and deletions of text from our current certificate are indicated by strike-outs.
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   61
Proxy Statement
The descriptions of these proposed amendments are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the revised certificate. If approved by our stockholders, the proposed amendments will become effective upon the filing of a revised certificate incorporating these amendments with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which filing would be made promptly after the annual meeting; provided that the board may abandon such proposed filing without further action by the stockholders if the board deems it to be in the best interests of stockholders.
Removing Requirement of Action by a Two-Thirds Vote of Continuing Directors for Certain Board Actions
In 2010, the board and the company's stockholders voted to repeal certain supermajority voting provisions in the company's certificate of incorporation relating to business combinations and make other related amendments to the certificate of incorporation. At that time, the then board had reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of such supermajority requirements and had determined their removal was in line with furthering the company's goal of ensuring the company's corporate governance policies, among other things, enhanced accountability to stockholders.
Pursuant to similar considerations, the current board has determined that removing the language requiring action by two-thirds of the company's "continuing directors" for certain board actions and related language (the "continuing director supermajority provisions"), to be advisable. The board believes that removing the continuing director supermajority provisions for the board actions further described below and instead having the full board take action by majority vote provides for more equitable board decision-making and makes each director more accountable to the company and its stockholders. These changes are also consistent with current practice and preferences of many other companies, investors, and corporate governance advisors.
The board believes it desirable to amend the continuing director supermajority provisions of the current certificate as follows:

Article THIRTEENTH, section (a) of the current certificate provides that the number of directors constituting the board shall be not less than six nor more than fifteen persons, with the exact number of directors fixed by board resolution adopted by two-thirds of the continuing directors. Article VI, section 2 of the revised certificate provides that the number of directors constituting the board shall be not less than six nor more than fifteen, with the exact number of directors fixed by board resolution adopted by a majority of the board. The board believes the revised language provides a more equitable method of setting the size of the board and makes each member more accountable to the company and its stockholders.
Filling Board Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships. Article THIRTEENTH, section (b) of the current certificate provides that vacancies of the board and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors shall be filled by a two-thirds vote of the continuing directors. Article VI, section 5 of the revised certificate provides that vacancies of the board and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors. The board believes the revised language provides a more equitable method for filling vacancies and newly created directorships of the board and makes each member more accountable to the company and its stockholders.
Calling Special Meetings of Stockholders. Article SIXTEENTH of the current certificate provides, among other things, that a special meeting of stockholders of the company shall be called by the chairman, president, or the secretary of the company upon the written request of two-thirds of the continuing directors. Article VII of the revised certificate provides that a special meeting of stockholders of the company shall be called by the chairman, president, or the secretary of the company upon the written request of a majority of the board. The board believes that the revised language provides a more equitable method for the board to determine whether to request a special meeting of stockholders and makes each member more accountable to the company and its stockholders. 
Related Changes. Article THIRTEENTH, sections (e) and (f) of the current certificate are removed in their entirety in the revised certificate, as they are related exclusively to defining the term "continuing director," which would no longer be used in the revised certificate.
Updating Capital Stock Provisions, Including "Blank Check" Preferred Stock
Article FOURTH of the current certificate provides for four classes of stock: common stock, preferred stock, preferred stock A, and preference stock. The company is authorized to issue a total of 502,000,000 shares of stock, which includes: 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share; 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $100.00 per share; 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock A, without par value; and 500,000 shares of preference stock, without par value. Article FOURTH also provides that preferred stock may be issued as either 4.50% series preferred stock or pursuant to blank check preferred stock provisions, and preferred stock A and preference stock may be issued pursuant to blank check preferred stock A or preference stock provisions, as the case may be. The current 
62   MDU Resources Group, Inc. Proxy Statement   
Proxy Statement
certificate's concept of "blank check" for preferred, preferred A and preference stock refers to authorized and unissued stock of a class, where the rights, preferences, powers and limitations of a series may be expressly determined by the board consistent with the provisions of Article FOURTH. In other words, the board is empowered to provide the specific terms and conditions of such series within the requirements of Article FOURTH.
In order to shorten and simplify the company's capital stock structure in the revised certificate, the board wishes to remove provisions in the current certificate relating to all prior series of preferred stock (including 4.50% series, 4.70% series and 5.10% series), the entire class of preferred stock A and the entire class and prior series (including series B preference) of preference stock. This proposed amendment removes classes and series of stock (and the related language) that are no longer relevant to the company or its capital stock structure, as the company currently has no shares (in any series) of preferred stock, preferred A stock or preference stock outstanding, having redeemed the last outstanding shares of its preferred stock in April 2017.
In the revised certificate, Article IV continues to provide the company authority to issue a total of 502,000,000 shares of stock, but instead of four classes of stock (i.e., common stock, preferred stock, preferred A stock, and preference stock), the company has two classes of stock: 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $100.00 per share. Article IV also updates the "blank check" preferred stock provision to a more customary formulation for modern certificates of incorporation and to be more consistent with the language of the DGCL. These proposed amendments included in Article IV do not substantively change the board's current rights to issue preferred stock, including its ability to set the relative rights, preferences, powers, and limitations of a series.
Under the updated capital stock provisions provided in the revised certificate, the board maintains its flexibility to seek future financing needs through equity (including customized preferred stock) financing as conditions may require without the delay, uncertainty and expense of obtaining stockholder approval for such transactions. 
Modernizing Corporate Purpose and Director Powers and Duties Language
Corporate Purpose. Article III of the revised certificate amends Article THIRD of the current certificate by retaining only its first sentence, which provides that the company's purpose is to engage in any lawful act or activity in accordance with Delaware law, and by removing the second sentence of Article THIRD, which lists non-exclusive examples of activities within the company's corporate purpose. The board believes that the revised language is a more customary formulation for modern certificates of incorporation and that it is preferable to simply state that the company may engage in any lawful act or activity, without including a specific list of its non-exclusive business activities.
Director Powers. Article NINTH of the current certificate provides a non-exclusive list of various powers conferred on the board. Article VI of the revised certificate removes such non-exclusive list and simply provides that the business and affairs of the company shall be managed by the board and that the board is empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such things (in addition to those conferred by the company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and by statute) as may be exercised and done by the company, unless prohibited by statute or by the company's certificate of incorporation. Pursuant to similar considerations regarding the proposed amendment to the corporate purpose provision, the board believes that the revised language is a more customary formulation for modern certificates of incorporation and that it is preferable to have broad and general language regarding the powers conferred on the board, without including a specific list of non-exclusive board powers.
Director Duties. Article FOURTEENTH of the current certificate provides a non-exclusive list of factors that the board may consider when, in exercising its judgment as to what is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, it evaluates a proposal by a party to make a tender or exchange offer for securities of the company; effect a merger, consolidation or other business combination with the company; or effect any other transaction having similar effects upon the properties, operations, or control of the company. This non-exclusive list includes "the projected social, legal and economic effects of the proposed action or transaction upon the Corporation or its Subsidiaries, its employees, suppliers, customers and others having similar relationships with the Corporation, and the communities in which the Corporation and its Subsidiaries do business." The language of Article FOURTEENTH of the current certificate is removed entirely in the revised certificate. Under Delaware law, it is the board's obligation for those transactions referenced in Article FOURTEENTH of the current certificate to act, exercising its appropriate judgment, in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. The board believes that removal of Article FOURTEENTH is preferable because the non-exclusive list includes reference to consideration of constituencies other than the company's stockholders, whose interests may conflict with, detract from, or otherwise not be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. By eliminating Article FOURTEENTH, the board's obligations in connection with a transaction will simply be governed by Delaware law rather than any express language in the revised certificate as is the case with most every other publicly traded company.

Housekeeping Revisions
In furtherance of the board's goal of updating and modernizing the current certificate, the revised certificate includes the following housekeeping revisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Removing the language of Article SEVENTH of the current certificate, which provides that the company is to have perpetual existence, as perpetual existence is already the default under Delaware law; 
• Removing the language of Article EIGHTH of the current certificate, which provides that the private property of company stockholders shall not be subject to the payment of corporate debts, as such protection is already provided under Delaware law without such provision; 
• Adding Article IX of the revised certificate, which consolidates into one provision the rights of the company to amend, alter, change, or repeal any provision of the company's certificate of incorporation and the rights relating to the board's and the stockholders' powers to adopt, amend, or repeal the company bylaws (including through adding language consistent with Delaware law and the board and stockholder approval standards which currently apply to the company); 
• Reorganizing and renumbering certain provisions, including deleting Articles in the current certificate that had been "[RESERVED]" and reorganizing and renumbering provisions in the revised certificate under headings titled Articles I-IX (with numbered subsections thereunder); and 
• Updating references to statutes, names, and dates, including correcting certain Delaware statutory references, revising language to be more gender inclusive and updating names and dates to reflect current circumstances. 
[END TABLE]
Approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes will count as votes against this proposal.
[BEGIN TABLE]
The board recommends a vote "for" this proposal for approval of the amendments to update and modernize the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including removing the requirement of action by a two-thirds vote of continuing directors for certain board actions.

A consolidation or merger of this Corporation with any other corporation or corporations shall not be regarded as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of this Corporation within the meaning of paragraph 10 or this paragraph 11, but no such consolidation or merger shall in any manner impair the rights or preferences of any of the Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock A or the Preference Stock.

(B)The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Preference Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series B Preference Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
(C)Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Preference Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.

Dividends paid on the shares of Series B Preference Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
