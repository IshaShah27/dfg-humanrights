VOTING INSTRUCTIONS
Quorum and Voting
The Amended and Restated By-Laws of JNL Series Trust, dated June 1, 1994 as amended and restated on September 25, 2017 (the "By-Laws"), provide that, the holders of a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a Shareholder meeting, except where any provision of law or the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust dated June 1, 1994 and amended and restated on September 25, 2017 (the "Declaration of Trust") provides otherwise. The presence of Jackson National and/or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York ("Jackson NY," and together with Jackson National, the "Insurance Companies"), through the presence of an authorized representative, constitutes a quorum.
The By-Laws further provide that shares may be voted in person or by proxy. A proxy with respect to shares held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to the exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving its invalidity shall rest on the challenger. At all meetings of Shareholders, unless inspectors of election have been appointed, all questions relating to the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided by the chairman of the meeting. Any person giving voting instructions may revoke them at any time prior to their exercise by submitting to the Secretary of the Trust a superseding voting instruction form or written notice of revocation. Voting instructions can be revoked until the Meeting date. Only the Contract Owner executing the voting instructions can revoke them. The Insurance Companies will vote the shares of the Fund in accordance with all properly executed and unrevoked voting instructions. Unless otherwise specified in the proxy, the proxy shall apply to all shares of the Fund owned by the Shareholder.
Required Vote
Generally, a simple majority of votes cast is sufficient to take or authorize action upon any matter which may be presented for a Shareholder vote, unless a different vote is required by law, the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws. Where a vote of the "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of a Fund is required to approve a proposal, it shall mean the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at the Meeting if holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Except as otherwise provided by law, if a Shareholder abstains from voting as to any matter, then the shares represented by such abstention will be treated as shares that are present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. However, abstentions will not be counted as a vote cast on such proposal. The approval of a Proposal depends upon whether a sufficient number of votes are cast for the Proposal. Accordingly, an instruction to abstain from voting on a Proposal has the same practical effect as an instruction to vote against the Proposal.
Approval of Proposal 1 and Proposal 4 will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the Shares present or represented and voting on that Proposal.
Approval of Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as that term is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act"), which is the lesser of (a) a vote of 67% or more of the Fund shares whose holders are present or represented by proxy at the meeting if the holders of more than 50% of all outstanding Fund shares are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, or (b) a vote of more than 50% of all outstanding Fund shares.
If the Proposals are approved by Shareholders of the Fund, they will be implemented on or about June 24 , 2019.
Contract Owner Voting Instructions
The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Interests in the Fund, a series of the Trust, are represented by shares. Shares of the Fund currently are sold only to separate accounts of Jackson National or Jackson NY to fund the benefits of variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts ("Variable Contracts") issued by Jackson National or Jackson NY (the "issuing insurers"), to employee benefit plans of Jackson National or directly to Jackson National, Jackson NY, or to regulated investment companies. Although the issuing insurers legally own all of the shares of the Fund held in their respective separate accounts that relate to Variable Contracts, a portion of the value of your Variable Contract is invested by the relevant issuing insurer, as provided in your Variable Contract, in shares of the Fund.
You have the right under your Variable Contract to instruct the issuing insurer how to vote the shares attributable to your Variable Contract. The issuing insurer will vote all such shares in accordance with the voting instructions timely given by the owners of Variable Contracts ("Contract Owners") with assets invested in the Fund. Contract Owners at the close of business on January 25, 2019 (the "Record Date"), will be entitled to notice of the Meeting and to instruct the relevant issuing insurer how to vote at the Meeting or any adjourned session. Jackson National and Jackson NY will vote shares owned by themselves or by the plans in proportion to voting instructions timely given by Contract Owners.
Contract Owners may use the enclosed voting instructions form as a ballot to give their voting instructions for those shares attributable to their Variable Contracts as of the Record Date. When a Contract Owner completes the voting instructions form and sends it to the appropriate issuing insurer, that issuing insurer will vote the shares attributable to the Variable Contract of the Contract Owner in accordance with the Contract Owner's instructions. If a Contract Owner merely signs and returns the form, the issuing insurer will vote those shares in favor of a Proposal. If the Contract Owner does not return the form, the issuing insurer will vote those shares in the same proportion as shares for which instructions were received from other Contract Owners. As a result of proportionate voting, a small number of Contract Owners could determine the outcome of the Proposals. The issuing insurers have fixed the close of business on March 13, 2019, as the last day on which voting instructions will be accepted. 
Adjournments
Any authorized voting instructions will be valid for any adjournment of the Meeting. If the Trust receives an insufficient number of votes to approve a Proposal, the Meeting may be adjourned to permit the solicitation of additional votes.
The Meeting may be adjourned by the chairperson of the Meeting from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place as determined by the chairperson of the Meeting for any reason, including failure of a Proposal to receive sufficient votes for approval. No Shareholder vote shall be required for any adjournment. No notice need be given that the Meeting has been adjourned other than by announcement at the Meeting. Any business that might have been transacted at the original Meeting may be transacted at any adjourned Meeting.
Revocation of Voting Instructions
Any person giving voting instructions may revoke them at any time prior to the Meeting by submitting to the Insurance Companies a superseding voting instruction form or written notice of revocation or by appearing and voting in person at the Meeting. Only the Contract Owner executing the voting instructions can revoke them. The Insurance Companies will vote the shares of the Fund in accordance with all properly executed and un-revoked voting instructions.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL 1
PROPOSAL 1: To approve name, investment objective, investment strategy, and PRIMARY AND secondary benchmark changes for the fund.
Introduction 
The Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, is an open-end investment company, commonly known as a mutual fund, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"). The Trust currently offers shares in 123 funds, including the Fund. This proxy statement is being furnished to Shareholders of the Fund and relates to certain fund changes that will convert the Fund from a fund-of-funds to an actively managed fund. 
The following changes are being proposed under Proposal 1: 
The Trust is providing this proxy statement to Shareholders investing in the Fund as of January 25, 2019, the Record Date.
JNAM is the investment adviser to the Trust and provides the Trust with professional investment supervision and management. JNAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson National, which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential plc, a publicly traded company incorporated in the United Kingdom. Prudential plc is not affiliated in any manner with Prudential Financial Inc., a company whose principal place of business is in the United States of America.  JNAM also serves as the Fund's Administrator.
As the investment adviser to the Trust, JNAM selects, contracts with, compensates, and monitors sub-advisers to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of each of the funds in the Trust.  In addition, JNAM monitors the compliance of the sub-advisers with the investment objectives and related policies of each series of the Trust and reviews the performance of the sub-advisers and reports on such performance to the Board. 
Overview and Board Approval
At a meeting held on December 10-12, 2018 (the "Board Meeting"), the Board, including the Trustees who are not "interested persons" as defined by the 1940 Act (the "Independent Trustees"), of the Trust voted to approve a change to the Fund's name from "JNL/Franklin Templeton Founding Strategy Fund" to "JNL/Franklin Templeton Growth Allocation Fund" and changes to the Fund's investment objective, investment strategy, and primary and secondary benchmarks. These changes are referred to as the "Strategy Changes" in this proxy statement.
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, also voted to approve appointment of Franklin as sub-adviser to the Fund and to approve a corresponding amendment to the Trust's existing Amended and Restated Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement between JNAM and Franklin, effective December 1, 2012, as amended ("Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement"), appointing Franklin as the sub-adviser to the Fund .  The appointment of Franklin as a sub-adviser to the Fund will be  effective on or about June 24 , 2019 (the "Effective Date"), subject to approval by Shareholders.
The Fund is currently structured as a fund-of-funds and allocates its assets among three underlying funds that are advised by JNAM and sub-advised by Franklin or its affiliates. Pending Shareholder approval of the Proposals and as a result of the Strategy Changes, the Fund will change from a fund-of-funds to an actively managed fund. JNAM will continue to serve as its investment adviser, but it is proposed that Franklin will serve as the Fund's new sub-adviser. The Fund does not currently pay advisory fees to JNAM. As a result of the structural change from a fund-of-funds to an actively managed Fund, it is further proposed that the Fund's advisory and administrative fees will increase, as described in Proposal 2 and Proposal 4, respectively, and a new sub-advisory fee will be implemented, as described in Proposal 3. The Amended and Restated Investment Advisory and Management Agreement between JNAM and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, effective July 1, 2013, as amended (the "Advisory Agreement"), was last approved by the Board, including the Independent Trustees, of the Fund at a meeting held on August 27-29, 2018. At the Board Meeting, in connection with the Strategy Changes, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, of the Fund voted to approve (i) an amendment to the Advisory Agreement reflecting the increased advisory fee, (ii) an amendment to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement approving Franklin as a sub-adviser to the Fund and the sub-advisory fee for the Fund, and (iii) an amendment to the Amended and Restated Administration Agreement between JNAM and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, effective July 1, 2013, as amended (the "Administration Agreement"), reflecting the increased administrative fee for the Fund. These fee changes are referred to as the "Fee Changes" in this proxy statement and are proposed to be effective on or about the Effective Date, subject to approval by Shareholders.
Despite the proposed increases in the Fund's current advisory and administrative fees and implementation of a new sub-advisory fee, it is expected that the Fund's total annual operating expenses will decrease as a result of the Strategy Changes and Fee Changes described in this proxy statement. This is because, as an actively managed fund, the Fund will no longer incur "acquired fund fees and expenses" from its investment in underlying funds. The Fund's total annual operating expenses are expected to decrease beginning on or about the Effective Date, as discussed in more detail below.
Information Regarding Strategy Changes 
JNAM is recommending certain changes for the Fund, which is currently a fund-of-funds and is managed by JNAM. The Fund does not currently have a sub-adviser. The Strategy Changes are being proposed to convert the Fund from a fund-of-funds that is designed to invest in three underlying funds to an actively managed Fund.
In acting as the Fund's new sub-adviser, Franklin will use an asset allocation approach to its investment process. With Franklin as its sub-adviser, the Fund will have significant flexibility to invest in a broad range of equity, fixed income, and alternative asset classes in the U.S. and other markets throughout the world, both developed and emerging.
If Shareholders approve the Strategy Changes, the Fund's investment objective and investment strategies will be revised to reflect that the Fund will no longer invest in underlying funds and to reflect Franklin's flexible asset allocation strategy. A comparison of the Fund's current investment objective and principal investment strategies and the proposed investment objective and principal investment strategies is shown in the table below.

Information Regarding Principal Risks
If Shareholders approve the Strategy Changes, the Fund's principal risks will also be revised. The Fund's current principal risks are based on the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds. If the Strategy Changes are approved, the principal risks will be revised consistent with Franklin's actively managed strategy for the Fund. A comparison of the Fund's current principal risks and the proposed principal risks is shown in the table below.
Information Regarding Primary and Secondary Benchmark Changes 
As part of the Strategy Changes, JNAM proposes to change the Fund's primary and secondary benchmarks as shown in the table below. JNAM recommends this change to the primary and secondary benchmarks for better consistency with the proposed Strategy Changes.

THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 1.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL 2
PROPOSAL 2: To approve a proposed amendment to the amended and restated investment advisory and management agreement between jnam and the trust, on behalf of the fund.
Overview and Introduction
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, voted to approve an amendment to the Advisory Agreement (the "Amendment"), which would increase the advisory fee payable by the Fund to JNAM .  The Amendment will be  effective on or about the Effective Date.
As discussed above, in connection with the Strategy Changes, the Fund will change from a fund-of-funds structure to an actively managed structure. In connection with this change from a fund-of-funds structure to an actively managed structure, the Fund's overall fee structure is proposed to change. Pending Shareholder approval of the Strategy Changes, JNAM will begin to oversee the proposed sub-adviser, Franklin, in implementing its new investment strategy for the Fund. This, combined with the Strategy Changes, will result in changes to certain of the services JNAM currently provides for the Fund.
As the investment adviser to the Trust, JNAM provides the Trust with professional investment supervision and management under the Advisory Agreement. JNAM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). Under the Trust's Advisory Agreement, JNAM is responsible for managing the affairs and overseeing the investments of the funds and determining how voting and other rights with respect to securities owned by each fund will be exercised. JNAM also provides recordkeeping, administrative, and exempt transfer agent services to the funds and oversees the performance of services provided to each fund by other service providers, including the custodian and shareholder servicing agent. JNAM is authorized to delegate certain of its duties with respect to a fund to a sub-adviser, subject to the approval of the Board, and is responsible for overseeing that sub-adviser's performance. JNAM plays an active role in advising and monitoring the funds of the Trust and their respective sub-adviser(s), if any. When appropriate, JNAM recommends to the Board potential sub-advisers for a fund. JNAM is solely responsible for payment of any fees to sub-advisers.

In addition, no Trustee has had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any material transactions since January 1, 2018, the beginning of the Trust's most recently completed fiscal year, or in any material proposed transactions, to which JNAM, any parent or subsidiary of JNAM, or any subsidiary of the parent of such entities was or is to be a party.
Information Regarding the Advisory Agreement with JNAM
JNAM is the adviser to all of the funds of the Trust, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. The Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by the Board with respect to the Fund at a meeting held on August 27-29, 2018, and was most recently approved by shareholders of all series of the Trust then in existence on October 10, 2000, in connection with an arrangement that would permit the investment adviser (formerly known as Jackson National Financial Services, LLC), with Board approval, to enter into or amend sub-advisory agreements without shareholder approval.
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, voted to approve the amendment to the Advisory Agreement, subject to Shareholder approval. The following description of the Advisory Agreement is qualified by the Advisory Agreement, attached as Appendix B.
Under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for managing the affairs and overseeing the investments of the Fund and determining how voting and other rights with respect to securities owned by the Fund will be exercised. The Adviser also provides recordkeeping, administrative, and exempt transfer agent services to the Fund and oversees the performance of services provided to the Fund by other service providers, including the custodian and shareholder servicing agent. The Adviser is authorized to delegate certain of its duties with respect to a Fund to a sub-adviser, subject to the approval of the Board, and is responsible for overseeing that sub-adviser's performance. The Adviser is solely responsible for payment of any fees to the sub-advisers.
The Advisory Agreement provides that it will remain in effect through September 30th each year, and thereafter only so long as the continuance is approved at least annually by September 30th by the Board or by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, and by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on sixty days' written notice by the Trust. The Advisory Agreement may be terminated by the Adviser at any time, without payment of any penalty, on like notice to the Trust, provided, however, that the Advisory Agreement may not be terminated by the Adviser unless another investment advisory agreement has been approved by the Trust, or after six months' written notice, whichever is earlier. The Advisory Agreement also terminates automatically in the event of its assignment.
The Advisory Agreement generally provides that the Adviser, its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates will not be subject to any liability to the Trust or to any shareholder of the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services including, without limitation, any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the funds in connection with the performance of the Adviser's duties under the Advisory Agreement, except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services. There are no material changes to the Advisory Agreement resulting from the changes described herein, except the advisory fee change for the Fund described below.
Material Terms of the Amendment to the Advisory Agreement
The Amendment to the Advisory Agreement will increase the advisory fee to be paid by the Fund, as shown below. The Amendment does not modify any other material terms of the Advisory Agreement. If Shareholders approve Proposal 2, the term of the Amendment will commence on or about the Effective Date. The Amendment and the Advisory Agreement, as amended, are attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B.
All services under the Amendment must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act and any rules and regulations thereunder, the Securities Act of 1933 and any rules and regulations thereunder, the Tax Code, any other applicable provisions of law, the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, and policies adopted by the Trustees and the investment policies of the Fund as adopted by the Board and as disclosed in the Fund's registration statements on file with the SEC, as amended from time to time.
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of advisory fees paid by the Fund to JNAM for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Assuming the Amendment to the Advisory Agreement was in place for the year ended December 31, 2018, the pro forma advisory fees would have been higher, as shown below.
The Board reviewed the proposed Amendment to the Advisory Agreement and believes that the proposed fee schedule is fair for the services to be provided by JNAM to the Fund. If this Proposal is approved by Shareholders, the Amendment to the Advisory Agreement with respect to the Fund will become effective on or about the Effective Date.
A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board of Trustees of the Amendment to the Advisory Agreement is contained under "Board of Trustees' Evaluation" below.
THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 2.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL 3
PROPOSAL 3: To approve a proposed amendment to the investment sub-advisory agreement between jnam and FRANKLIN, approving FRANKLIN as sub-adviser to the fund.
Overview and Introduction
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, of the Fund voted to approve the appointment of Franklin as the sub-adviser for the Fund and to approve a corresponding amendment (the "Amendment") to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement appointing Franklin as the Fund's sub-adviser, subject to approval by Shareholders. Pending Shareholder approval, Franklin will begin providing the day-to-day management for the Fund, effective on or about the Effective Date.
If approved by Shareholders, Franklin will be appointed as the sub-adviser for the Fund and the principal investment strategies for the Fund will be updated per the Strategy Changes discussed above.
There is currently not a sub-advisory fee structure in place for the Fund, as the Fund does not currently have a sub-adviser. The proposed sub-advisory fee will be paid by JNAM to Franklin on behalf of the Fund. As discussed above, it is proposed that the Fund will change from a fund-of-funds to an actively managed Fund effective on or about the Effective Date, and as a result the Fund's total net expense ratio is expected to decrease.
Information concerning Franklin – Proposed Investment Sub-Adviser
Franklin is located at One Franklin Parkway, San Mateo, California 94403. Franklin Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc., a publicly owned company engaged in the financial services industry through its subsidiaries. Charles B.

Franklin and its affiliates provide investment advisory services to individual and institutional investor accounts. Franklin also serves as sub-adviser to other funds of the Trust. As of December 31, 2018, Franklin and its affiliates managed over $ 6.0 billion in assets. 
As the sub-adviser to the Fund, Franklin will provide the Fund with investment research, advice, and supervision, and will manage the Fund consistent with its investment objective and policies (as amended per the Strategy Changes discussed above), including the purchase, retention, and disposition of securities, as set forth in the Fund's current Prospectus.

Information regarding the Sub-Advisory Agreement with Franklin
Franklin is a sub-adviser to separate funds of the Trust, pursuant to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by the Board at a meeting held on August 27-29, 2018. JNAM has received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits JNAM, subject to certain conditions, to enter into agreements relating to the Trust with unaffiliated sub-advisers approved by the Board without obtaining shareholder approval. As such, the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement has not been approved by shareholders but is regularly reviewed by JNAM and the Board pursuant to the exemptive order.
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, voted to appoint Franklin as a sub-adviser to the Fund and approved the Amendment to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, subject to Shareholder approval. The following description of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement is qualified by the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, attached as Appendix C.
Under the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, Franklin provides investment portfolio management services to certain funds of the Trust. Franklin is responsible for managing the investment and reinvestment of the assets of those funds, subject to the oversight and supervision of JNAM and the Board. Franklin is also responsible for supervising and directing the investments of each fund in accordance with its investment objective, program, and restrictions. Franklin is responsible for effecting all securities transactions on behalf of the Fund.
The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that it will remain in effect through September 30th each year, and thereafter only so long as the continuance is approved at least annually by September 30th by the Board or by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, and by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on sixty days' written notice by the Trust or JNAM, or on sixty days' written notice by Franklin. The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement also terminates automatically in the event of its assignment.
The Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement generally provides that Franklin, its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates will not be subject to any liability to JNAM or the funds or their directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the funds in connection with the performance of Franklin's duties under the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement or its failure to perform due to events beyond its reasonable control, except for a loss resulting from willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement.
If the sub-adviser appointment is approved by Shareholders, JNAM will be obligated to pay Franklin out of the advisory fee it receives from the Fund.
Material Terms of the Amendment to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement
The Amendment adds the Fund to the current Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement. In all material respects, the Amendment does not modify the material terms of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, and (other than with respect to the specified fee rate for the Fund) the same terms will apply to the Fund as currently apply to the existing funds for which Franklin serves as sub-adviser. If Shareholders approve the Proposal, the term of the Amendment will commence on or about the Effective Date. The Amendment and the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, as amended, are attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C.
Under the Amendment, Franklin would provide sub-advisory services to the Fund, including making decisions regarding the acquisitions, holding, or disposition of securities or other assets that the Fund may own or contemplate acquiring from time to time. All services under the Amendment must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act and any rules and regulations thereunder, the Securities Act of 1933 and any rules and regulations thereunder, the Tax Code, any other applicable provisions of law, the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, and policies adopted by the Trustees and the investment policies of the Fund as adopted by the Board and as disclosed in the Fund's registration statements on file with the SEC, as amended from time to time.
The advisory fees to be paid by the Fund are described above in Proposal 2. JNAM is responsible for paying all sub-advisers out of its own resources. As noted above, there is not currently a sub-advisory fee structure for the Fund. If Proposal 3 is approved, JNAM will pay Franklin a sub-advisory fee equal to a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to the Fund, based on the below schedule.
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of sub-advisory fees paid by JNAM, on behalf of the Fund, for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Assuming the Amendment to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement was in place for the year ended December 31, 2018, the pro forma sub-advisory fees would have been higher, as shown below.
The Trustees believe that the proposed fee schedule is fair for the services to be provided by Franklin to the Fund. If this Proposal is approved by Shareholders, the Amendment and Franklin's appointment as sub-adviser to the Fund will become effective on or about the Effective Date.
A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board of Trustees of the Amendment is contained under "Board of Trustees' Evaluation" below.
Portfolio Management

The portfolio managers of the Fund are jointly and primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio.

Other Investment Companies Sub-Advised by Franklin
THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 3.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL 4
PROPOSAL 4: To approve a proposed amendment to the amended and restated administration agreement between jnam and the trust, on behalf of the fund.
Overview and Introduction
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, of the Fund voted to approve an amendment ("Amendment") to the Administration Agreement. In connection with the Strategy Changes described earlier in this proxy statement, the Fund will convert from a fund-of-funds to an actively managed fund effective on or about the Effective Date. As also described earlier in this proxy statement, the change to an actively managed structure will result in changes to the administrative services to be provided the Fund and the corresponding administrative fee to be paid by the Fund.
Information Regarding the Administration Agreement with JNAM
JNAM serves as the administrator to the Fund.  JNAM, in its capacity as administrator, provides or procures, at its own expense, certain legal, audit, fund accounting, custody (except overdraft and interest expense), printing and mailing, and other administrative services necessary for the operation of the funds of the Trust.  In addition, JNAM, in its capacity as administrator, also pays a portion of the costs of the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer. In return for these services, each fund pays JNAM an administrative fee equal to a certain percentage of the fund's average daily net assets, accrued daily and paid monthly.
Each fund is responsible for trading expenses including brokerage commissions, interest and taxes, and other non-operating expenses.  Each fund is also responsible for nonrecurring and extraordinary legal fees, interest expenses, registration fees, licensing costs, a portion of the Chief Compliance Officer costs, directors and officers insurance, the fees and expenses of the disinterested Trustees, and of independent legal counsel to the Independent Trustees.
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, voted to approve the Amendment to the Administration Agreement, subject to Shareholder approval. This description of the Administration Agreement is qualified by the Administration Agreement, attached as Appendix D.
There are no material changes to the Administration Agreement resulting from the changes described in this proxy statement, other than the fee change described below.
Material Terms of the Amendment to the Administration Agreement
The Amendment will change the administrative fee payable by the Fund to JNAM, as its administrator. In all material respects, the Amendment does not modify the material terms of the Administration Agreement, and (other than with respect to the specified fee rate for the Fund) the same terms will apply to the Fund as currently apply to the Fund under the Administration Agreement. If Shareholders approve the Proposal, the term of the Amendment will commence on or about the Effective Date. The Amendment and the Administration Agreement, as amended, are attached to this proxy statement as Appendix D.
Under the Amendment, JNAM would provide administrative services to the Fund that are consistent with administrative services provided to other actively managed funds in the Trust. The fee structure outlined below and in the Amendment will therefore bring the Fund more in line with other actively managed funds in the Trust.
Currently, the Fund pays JNAM an administrative fee equal to a percentage of its average daily net assets based on the below schedule. 
Pending Shareholder approval, the Fund will pay JNAM an administrative fee equal to a percentage of its average daily net assets based on the below schedule.
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of administrative fees paid to JNAM by the Fund, for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Assuming the Amendment to the Administration Agreement was in place for the year ended December 31, 2018, the pro forma administrative fees would have been higher, as shown below.
The Trustees believe that the proposed fee schedule is fair for the services to be provided by JNAM as administrator to the Fund. If this Proposal is approved by Shareholders, the Amendment will become effective on or about the Effective Date.
THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 4.
COMPARATIVE FEE AND EXPENSE TABLES
Although the advisory and administrative fees of the Fund are proposed to be increased and a new sub-advisory fee structure is proposed to be implemented, as discussed above, there will be no resulting increase to the Fund's total annual operating expenses or expense examples.
Fee Tables
The following tables show the fees and expenses of the Fund and the estimated pro forma fees and expenses of shares of the Fund after giving effect to the Proposals discussed in this proxy statement. Fees and expenses for the Fund are based on those incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The pro forma fees and expenses of the Fund shares assume that the Proposals had been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018. The tables below do not reflect any fees and expenses related to the Variable Contracts or the separate account through which you indirectly invest in the Fund, whichever may be applicable, which would increase overall fees and expenses. Please refer to your Variable Contract prospectus for a description of those fees and expenses.
JNL/Franklin Templeton Founding Strategy Fund
Annual Fund Operating Expenses
(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)
JNL/Franklin Templeton Growth Allocation Fund
Pro Forma Annual Fund Operating Expenses
(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)
Expense Examples
This example is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. This example does not reflect fees and expenses related to the Variable Contracts or the separate account through which you indirectly invest in the Fund, whichever may be applicable, and the total expenses would be higher if they were included. The example assumes that:
Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND FUND TRANSACTIONS
With respect to portfolio security transactions, JNAM and Franklin would attempt to achieve best execution and have complete freedom as to the markets in and the broker/dealers through which they seek this result. JNAM and Franklin would be authorized, consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, when placing portfolio transactions for the Fund with a broker to pay a brokerage commission (to the extent applicable) in excess of that which another broker might have charged for effecting the same transaction on account of the receipt of research, market or statistical information. The term "research, market or statistical information" may include (a) advice as to (i) the value of securities, (ii) the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and (iii) the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities and (b) furnishing analysis and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts. Higher commissions are authorized to be paid to firms that provide research services to the extent permitted by law. JNAM and Franklin would be able to use this research information in managing the Fund's assets, as well as the assets of other clients. However, Franklin currently does not plan to use soft dollars, engage in directed brokerage or engage in cross trades with client accounts it manages in connection with the Fund's securities transactions.
Any portfolio transaction for the Fund may be executed through brokers that are affiliated with the Fund, other funds of the Trust, JNAM, and/or a sub-adviser, if, in the sub-adviser's judgment, the use of such affiliated brokers is likely to result in price and execution at least as favorable as those of other qualified brokers, and if, in the transaction, the affiliated broker charges the Fund a commission rate consistent with those charged by the affiliated broker to comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. All transactions with affiliated brokers will comply with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund paid no commissions to any affiliated broker.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund paid $ 4,142,283 in 12b-1 fees to JNAM and/or its affiliated persons. It is expected that the services under the Amended and Restated Distribution Plan for the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, will continue after the Proposals discussed herein become effective.
Board of Trustees' Evaluation 
The Board oversees the management of the Trust and the Fund and, as required by law, determines whether to approve the Advisory Agreement with JNAM and the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement (collectively with the Advisory Agreement, the "Agreements").
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, considered information relating to the appointment of Franklin as sub-adviser to the Fund (to be renamed the JNL/Franklin Templeton Growth Allocation Fund) and a corresponding amendment to the Trust's existing Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement.  The Board also considered an amendment to the Advisory Agreement that would increase the Fund's advisory fee in connection with the Fund's other proposed changes.
In advance of the meeting, independent legal counsel for the Independent Trustees requested that certain information be provided to the Board relating to the Agreements.  The Board received, and had the opportunity to review, this and other materials, ask questions and request further information in connection with its consideration of the Agreements.  With respect to its approval of the Amendment to the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board noted that the Sub-Advisory Agreement was with a sub-adviser that already provides services to another series of the Trust. Thus, with respect to Franklin, the Board also considered relevant information provided at previous Board meetings. At the conclusion of the Board's discussions, the Board approved the Agreements.
In reviewing the Agreements and considering the information, the Board was advised by outside independent legal counsel.  The Board considered the factors it deemed relevant, as applicable, including: (1) the nature, quality and extent of the services to be provided; (2) the investment performance of the Fund; (3) cost of services of the Fund; (4) profitability data; (5) whether economies of scale may be realized and shared, in some measure, with investors as the Fund grows; and (6) other benefits that may accrue to JNAM or Franklin through its relationship with the Trust.  In its deliberations, the Board, in exercising its business judgment did not identify any single factor that alone was responsible for the Board's decision to approve the Agreements.
Before approving the Agreements, the Independent Trustees met in executive session with their independent legal counsel to consider the materials provided by JNAM and Franklin and to consider the terms of the Agreements.  Based on its evaluation of those materials and the information the Board received throughout the year at its regular meetings, the Board, including the interested and Independent Trustees, concluded that the Agreements are in the best interests of the shareholders of the Fund.  In reaching its conclusions, the Board considered numerous factors, including the following:
Nature, Quality and Extent of Services
The Board examined the nature, quality and extent of the services provided by JNAM and to be provided by Franklin.
The Board considered the services provided by JNAM, including but not limited to the oversight of Franklin pursuant to the Trust's "Manager of Managers" exemption, as well as the provision of recordkeeping and compliance services to the Fund.  The Board also took into account that JNAM would monitor the performance of the various organizations that would provide services to the Fund, including the Fund's distributor and custodian.  With respect to JNAM's oversight of Franklin, the Board noted that JNAM would be responsible for screening and recommending new sub-advisers when appropriate, as well as monitoring and reporting to the Board on a regular basis as to the performance and operations of Franklin.
The Board also considered the investment sub-advisory services to be provided by Franklin.  The Board noted JNAM's evaluation of Franklin, as well as JNAM's recommendations, based on its review of Franklin, in connection with its approval of the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Board also considered the various business-related risks JNAM faces as a result of managing the series of the Trust, including entrepreneurial, legal and litigation risks, some of which may be significant.
The Board reviewed the qualifications, backgrounds, and responsibilities of JNAM's senior management that would be responsible for oversight of the Fund and Franklin, and also reviewed the qualifications, backgrounds, and responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser's portfolio managers, who would be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.  The Board reviewed information pertaining to JNAM's and Franklin's organizational structure, senior management, financial condition, investment operations, and other relevant information pertaining to both JNAM and Franklin. The Board considered compliance reports about JNAM and Franklin from the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer.
Based on the foregoing, the Board concluded that (i) the Fund is likely to benefit from the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by JNAM under the Advisory Agreement and (ii) the Fund is likely to benefit from the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided by Franklin under the Franklin Sub-Advisory Agreement.
Investment Performance of the Fund 
JNL/Franklin Templeton Founding Strategy Fund (to be renamed the JNL/Franklin Templeton Growth Allocation Fund). The Board reviewed the performance of Franklin's investment mandate with a similar investment strategy and composite performance compared to the Fund and the Fund's benchmark, proposed new benchmarks, and peer group. The Board concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders to approve the Agreements.
Costs of Services
The Board reviewed the fees to be paid to JNAM and Franklin. The Board reviewed fee and expense information as compared to that of comparable funds managed by other advisers, as well as fees charged by Franklin to similar clients.  The Board also noted that JNAM does not manage any institutional accounts with which the Fund's fees could be compared.  Using information provided by an independent data service, the Board evaluated the Fund's net advisory fees compared to the average advisory fees for other funds similar in size, character and investment strategy (the "peer group").  While the Board also considered the Fund's sub-advisory fee and compared that to the average sub-advisory fee of the peer group, the Board noted that the Fund's sub-advisory fee would be paid by JNAM (not the Fund) and, therefore, would be neither a direct shareholder expense nor a direct influence on the Fund's total expense ratio.
JNL/Franklin Templeton Founding Strategy Fund (to be renamed the JNL/Franklin Templeton Growth Allocation Fund). The Board noted that the appointment of the Fund's sub-adviser is being proposed in conjunction with various investment strategy and fee changes to this Fund, including a change from a fund-of-funds structure to an actively managed fund structure. In this regard, the Board considered the proposed sub-advisory fee, noting that the Fund does not currently have a sub-advisory fee and that the proposed sub-advisory fee is lower than the peer group average. It further noted that the proposed advisory fee is higher than the current advisory fee but that the proposed total expense ratio is lower than the current total expense ratio. It also noted that the proposed advisory fee is lower and the proposed total expense ratio is higher than the respective peer group averages. The Board also considered that, in connection with the changes to this Fund, the Fund's proposed total expense ratio is approximately 5 basis points lower than the current total expense ratio. The Board concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory fees are in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders in light of the services to be provided.
Economies of Scale
The Board considered whether the Fund's proposed fees reflect the potential for economies of scale for the benefit of Fund shareholders.  Based on information provided by JNAM and Franklin, the Board noted that the advisory and sub-advisory fee arrangement for the Fund contains breakpoints that decrease the fee rate as assets increase. 
The Board considered that Franklin has agreed to a breakpoint in the sub-advisory fee rate. The Board noted that the sub-advisory fee for each Fund is paid by JNAM (not the Fund).  It is further noted that the existing sub-advisory fee relationship discount agreement between JNAM and Franklin would decrease the fee rates as Fund assets increase in the future.
The Board concluded that the fees in some measure share economies of scale with shareholders.
Other Benefits to JNAM and Franklin
In evaluating the benefits that may accrue to JNAM through its relationship with the Fund, the Board noted that JNAM and certain of its affiliates serve the Fund in various capacities, including as adviser, administrator, transfer agent, and distributor, and receive compensation from the Fund in connection with providing services to the Fund.  The Board noted that each service provided to the Fund by JNAM or one of its affiliates is pursuant to a written agreement, which the Board evaluates periodically as required by law.  The Board also noted that Franklin may from time to time pay for portions of meetings organized by the Fund's distributor to educate wholesalers about the funds that Franklin manages.  The Board considered JNAM's assertion that those meetings do not yield a profit to the distributor, that a sub-adviser is not required to participate in the meetings and that recommendations to hire or fire sub-advisers are not influenced by the sub-adviser's willingness to participate in the meetings.  Lastly, the Board noted that certain affiliates of JNAM may receive benefits under the federal income tax laws with respect to tax deductions and credits.
In evaluating the benefits that may accrue to Franklin through its relationship with the Funds, the Board noted that Franklin may receive indirect benefits in the form of soft dollar arrangements for portfolio securities trades placed with the Fund's assets and may also develop additional investment advisory business with JNAM, the Fund or other clients of Franklin as a result of its relationship with the Fund.
OTHER MATTERS
JNAM, the investment adviser to the Trust, is located at 225 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. JNAM also serves as the Trust's Administrator. Jackson National Life Distributors LLC ("JNLD"), an affiliate of the JNAM and the Trust, is principal underwriter for the Trust, including the Fund, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson. JNLD is located at 300 Innovation Drive, Franklin, Tennessee 37067. JNLD also is the principal underwriter of the variable annuity insurance products issued by Jackson National and its subsidiaries.
OUTSTANDING SHARES
The Trustees have fixed the close of business on January 25, 2019, as the Record Date for the determination of the Shareholders entitled to vote at the Meeting. Shareholders on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote for each full share held and to a proportionate fractional vote for each fractional share. As of the Record Date, there were issued and outstanding the following number of Fund shares:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Fund  Shares Outstanding 
   Fund  Shares Outstanding 
[END TABLE]
As of January 25, 2019, the officers and Trustees of the Trust, as a group, owned less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.
Because shares in the Trust are sold only to Jackson National, Jackson NY, certain Funds of the Trust, and certain investment companies managed by affiliates of JNAM organized as Fund of Funds, Jackson National, through its separate accounts which hold shares in the Trust as funding vehicles for variable insurance contracts and certain retirement plans, is the owner of record of substantially all of the shares of the Trust. In addition, Jackson National, through its general account, is the beneficial owner of shares in certain of the funds, in some cases representing the initial capital contributed at the inception of a fund, and in other cases representing investments made for other corporate purposes. As may be required by applicable law and interpretations of the staff of the SEC, Jackson National and Jackson NY will solicit voting instructions from owners of Variable Contracts regarding matters submitted to Shareholder vote and will vote the shares held by its separate accounts in accordance with the voting instructions received from Contract Owners to whose contracts such shares are attributable. This is sometimes referred to as "pass through" voting. Further, those shares which are owned by Jackson National through its general account, and shares held in the separate accounts for which no voting instructions are received from Contract Owners, also will be voted in the same proportions as those shares for which voting instructions are received from Contract Owners. This is sometimes referred to as "echo" voting.
As of the Record Date, January 25, 2019, no persons owned 5% or more of the shares of the Fund either beneficially or of record . 
Contract Owners may be deemed to have an indirect beneficial interest in the Fund shares owned by the separate accounts. As noted above, Contract Owners have the right to give instructions to the insurance company Shareholders as to how to vote the Fund shares attributable to their Variable Contracts. As of January 25, 2019,  the following  person may be deemed to have an indirect beneficial interest totaling more than 25% of the voting securities of the Fund : 
CONTINGENCY PLAN
If the Proposals are not approved by Shareholders of the Fund, Franklin will not be appointed as the sub-adviser to the Fund and the changes described in the Proposals under the "Summary of the Proposals" section will not become effective. Further, if the Proposals are not approved, the Fund will continue to operate as it currently does. In that case, the Board will consider what, if any, course of action should be taken. While the Board has made no determination regarding this contingency, it is possible that the Board would determine to re-solicit the Shareholders of the Fund to approve the Proposals.
OTHER BUSINESS
The Trustees do not intend to present and do not have reason to believe that others will present any other items of business at the Meeting. However, if other matters are properly presented to the Meeting for a vote, the proxies will be voted upon such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons acting under the proxies.
The Trust does not hold regular meetings of Shareholders. Shareholders wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a subsequent meeting of Shareholders should send their written proposals to the Secretary of the Trust at the address set forth on the first page of this proxy statement.
Proposals must be received a reasonable time prior to the date of a meeting of Shareholders to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for a meeting. Timely submission of a proposal does not, however, necessarily mean that the proposal will be included. Persons named as proxies for any subsequent meeting of Shareholders will vote in their discretion with respect to proposals submitted on an untimely basis.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND CONTRACT OWNER VOTING INSTRUCTIONS
In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, voting instructions may be solicited by letter, telephone, or personal contact by officers or employees of the Trust, JNAM, or Jackson National.
JNAM, as the Trust's Administrator, has retained the services of Computershare Fund Services ("Computershare"), 2950 Express Drive South, Suite 210, Islandia, New York 11749, to assist in the solicitation of voting instructions. The anticipated cost of the services to be provided by Computershare in connection with this proxy solicitation is approximately $98,863.
The costs of the printing and mailing of the Notice, this Proxy Statement, and the accompanying voting instruction card, and the solicitation of Contract Owner voting instructions, will be paid by JNAM. The Trust is not expected to bear any significant expenses in connection with the Meeting or the solicitation of proxies and voting instructions.
PROMPT EXECUTION AND RETURN OF THE ENCLOSED VOTING INSTRUCTIONS FORM IS REQUESTED. A SELF-ADDRESSED, POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE IS ENCLOSED FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE.

Portfolio Turnover (% of average value of portfolio). The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example above, affect the Fund's performance.

Principal Investment Strategies. The Fund has significant flexibility to invest in a broad range of equity, fixed income, and alternative asset classes in the U.S. and other markets throughout the world, both developed and emerging. 
Under normal market conditions, Franklin Advisers, Inc., the Fund's sub-adviser (the "Sub-Adviser"), uses a flexible allocation approach when allocating the Fund's assets among the broad asset classes of equity and fixed-income investments. 
When selecting equity investments, the Sub-Adviser considers foreign and domestic exposure, market capitalization ranges, and investment style (growth vs. value). 
When selecting fixed-income investments, the Sub-Adviser focuses primarily on maximizing income, appropriate to the Fund's risk profile and considers the duration and maturity of its investments. The Fund may also invest in fixed income securities of any credit rating, including below investment grade or "junk" bonds.
As part of these equity and fixed-income investments, the Sub-Adviser may invest up to 10% of the Fund's assets in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), including those advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates. Such mutual funds or ETFs may invest in a variety of U.S. and foreign equity and fixed income securities of any rating that may employ a growth or value investment style. 
The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments. 
The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by making allocations (approximately 33 1/3%) of its assets and cash flows among the following three Funds ("Underlying Funds"):
The JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund seeks long-term capital growth by investing, under normal market conditions, primarily in the equity securities of companies located anywhere in the world, including emerging markets. Under normal market conditions, the JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund invests significantly (ordinarily at least 40% unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by Templeton Global Advisors Limited (in this paragraph, "Sub-Adviser"), in which case the JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund would invest at least 30%) in non-U.S. companies. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries, including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). Although the JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund seeks investments across a number of countries and sectors, from time to time, based on economic conditions, the JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund may have significant positions in particular regions, such as Europe, or sectors. Depending upon current market conditions, the JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in debt securities of companies and governments located anywhere in the world. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Global Fund also may invest in depositary receipts and may use derivative strategies.
The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund seeks to maximize income while maintaining prospects for capital appreciation by investing, under normal market conditions, in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund may shift its investments from one asset class to another based on the analysis of Franklin Advisers, Inc. (in this paragraph, "Sub-Adviser") as to the best opportunities for the JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund's portfolio in a given market. The equity securities in which the JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund invests consist primarily of common stock. Debt securities include all varieties of fixed, floating and variable rate instruments, including secured and unsecured bonds, bonds convertible into common stock, senior floating rate and term loans, mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, debentures, and shorter term instruments. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund seeks income by selecting investments such as corporate, foreign and U.S. Treasury bonds, as well as stocks with dividend yields the Sub-Adviser believes are attractive. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund may invest up to 100% of its total assets in debt securities that are rated below investment grade (also known as "junk bonds"), including a portion in defaulted securities. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund maintains the flexibility to invest in securities of companies from a variety of sectors, but from time to time, based on economic conditions, the Fund may have significant investments in particular sectors. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund may also invest up to 25% of its assets in foreign securities, either directly or through depositary receipts. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Income Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in equity-linked notes, which are hybrid derivative-type instruments that are specially designed to combine the characteristics of one or more reference securities (usually a single stock, a stock index or a basket of stocks (underlying securities)) and a related equity derivative, such as a put or call option, in a single note form.
The JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund seeks capital appreciation, which may occasionally be short-term (which is capital appreciation return on an investment in less than 12 months), and secondarily, income. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund primarily invests in equity securities (including securities convertible into, or that Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC (in this paragraph, "Sub-Adviser") expects to be exchanged for, common or preferred stock) of U.S. and foreign companies that the Sub-Adviser believes are available at market prices less than their value based on certain recognized or objective criteria (intrinsic value). To a lesser extent, the JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund also invests in merger arbitrage and the debt and equity of distressed companies. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund may invest a significant portion (up to 35%) of its assets in foreign securities, which may include sovereign debt and participations in foreign government debt. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund is not limited to pre-set maximums or minimums governing the size of the companies in which it may invest. However, the JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund generally invests the equity portion of its portfolio primarily to predominantly in companies with market capitalizations greater than $5 billion, with a portion or significant amount in smaller companies, which are generally companies with market capitalizations less than $5 billion. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund regularly attempts to hedge (protect) against currency risks, largely using currency forward contracts and currency futures contracts (including currency index futures contracts) when, in the Sub-Adviser's opinion, it would be advantageous to the JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund to do so. The JNL/Franklin Templeton Mutual Shares Fund may also, from time to time, attempt to hedge against market risk using a variety of derivatives.
These Underlying Funds invest primarily in U.S. and foreign equity securities, and, to a lesser extent, fixed-income and money market securities.
The investment policies of the Underlying Funds are further described elsewhere in this Prospectus.
Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not guaranteed. As with any mutual fund, the value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. The principal risks associated with investing in the Fund include: An investment in the Fund is not guaranteed. As with any mutual fund, the value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. The principal risks associated with investing in the Underlying Funds include:
Performance. The performance information shown provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compared with those of broad-based securities market indices and a composite index which have investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. Performance prior to June 24 , 2019 reflects the Fund's results when the Fund did not have a sub-adviser and operated as a fund-of-funds. Effective June 24 , 2019, the Fund is sub-advised and no longer operates as a fund-of-funds. The Fund's past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.
Effective June 24 , 2019, for consistency with the Fund's principal investment strategies, the Fund's primary benchmark, Dow Jones Moderately Aggressive Index, was replaced with the Morningstar Moderately Aggressive Target Risk Index.
Effective June 24 , 2019, for consistency with the Fund's principal investment strategies, the Fund's secondary benchmark, 80% MSCI All Country World Index (Net), 20% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, was replaced with the 50% S&P 500 Index, 25% MSCI All Country World Index ex USA (Net), 25% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Information for Class I shares is not shown because Class I shares commenced operations on September 25, 2017.
The returns shown in the bar chart and table do not include charges that will be imposed by variable insurance products. If these amounts were reflected, returns would be less than those shown.

Portfolio Management.
Investment Adviser to the Fund:   Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
Sub-Adviser: Franklin Advisers, Inc. ("Franklin Advisers")
Portfolio Managers:
Purchase and Redemption of Fund Shares 
Only separate accounts of Jackson National Life Insurance Company ("Jackson") or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York ("Jackson NY") and series, including fund of funds, of registered investment companies in which either or both of those insurance companies invest may purchase shares of the Fund. You may invest indirectly in the Fund through your purchase of a variable annuity or life insurance contract issued by a separate account of Jackson or Jackson NY that invests directly, or through a fund of funds, in this Fund. Any minimum initial or subsequent investment requirements and redemption procedures are governed by the applicable separate account through which you invest indirectly.
This Fund serves as an underlying investment by insurance companies, affiliated investment companies, and retirement plans for funding variable annuity and life insurance contracts and retirement plans.
Tax Information
The Fund expects to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not expect to make regular distributions (other than in redemption of Fund shares) to shareholders, which generally are the participating insurance companies investing in the Fund through separate accounts of Jackson or Jackson NY and mutual funds owned directly or indirectly by such separate accounts. You should consult the prospectus of the appropriate separate account or description of the plan for a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of your contract, policy, or plan.
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Financial Intermediaries
If you invest in the Fund under a variable insurance contract or a plan that offers a variable insurance contract as a plan option through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a financial institution), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's Website for more information.

Such mutual funds or ETFs may invest in a variety of U.S. and foreign equity and fixed income securities of any rating that may employ a growth or value investment style. 
The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments. 
When the Sub-Adviser believes market or economic conditions are unfavorable, the Sub-Adviser may invest up to 100% of the Fund's assets in a temporary defensive manner by holding all or a substantial portion of its assets in cash, cash equivalents or other high quality short-term investments. Temporary defensive investments generally may include money market fund shares, money market instruments and short-term debt securities.

APPENDIX B
Amended and Restated
Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
This Agreement is effective as of the 31st day of January, 2001, Amended and Restated as of the 28th day of February, 2012, further Amended and Restated as of the 1st day of December, 2012, further Amended and Restated as of the 30th November, 2012, effective as of April 29, 2013, and further Amended and Restated as of the 24th day of June, 2013, effective as of July 1, 2013, between JNL Series Trust, a Massachusetts business trust (the "Trust"), and Jackson National Asset Management, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (the "Adviser").
Whereas, the Trust is authorized to issue separate series, each series having its own investment objective or objectives, policies and limitations;
Whereas, the Trust on behalf of its investment series listed on Schedule A hereto (each a "Fund") desires to retain Adviser to perform investment advisory services, on the terms and conditions set forth herein; and
Whereas, the Adviser agrees to serve as the investment adviser and business manager for the Fund on the terms and conditions set forth herein.
Now Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:
1. Appointment
The Trust hereby appoints the Adviser to provide certain investment advisory services to the Fund for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services herein set forth for the compensation herein provided.
In the event the Trust designates one or more series other than the Fund with respect to which the Trust wishes to retain the Adviser to render investment advisory services hereunder, it shall notify the Adviser in writing. If the Adviser is willing to render such services, it shall notify the Trust in writing, whereupon such series shall become a Fund hereunder, and be subject to this Agreement.
2. Duties
The Adviser shall manage the affairs of the Trust including, but not limited to, continuously providing the Trust with investment advice and business management, including investment research, advice and supervision, determining which securities, commodities, and derivatives thereon (hereinafter collectively, "securities") shall be purchased or sold by each Fund, effecting purchases and sales of securities on behalf of each Fund (and determining how voting and other rights with respect to securities owned by each Fund shall be exercised). The management of the Fund by the Adviser shall be subject to the control of the Trustees of the Trust (the "Trustees") and in accordance with the objectives, policies and principles for each Fund set forth in the Trust's Registration Statement and its current Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, as amended from time to time, the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), and other applicable law, as well as to the factors affecting each Funds' status as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code"), and the regulations thereunder and the status of separate accounts supporting variable contracts under the diversification requirements set forth in Section 817(h) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. In performing such duties, the Adviser shall (i) provide such office space, bookkeeping, accounting, clerical, secretarial, and administrative services (exclusive of, and in addition to, any such service provided by any others retained by the Trust or any of its Fund) and such executive and other personnel as shall be necessary for the operations of each Fund, (ii) be responsible for the financial and accounting records required to be maintained by each Fund (including those maintained by the Trust's custodian), and (iii) oversee the performance of services provided to each Fund by others, including the custodian, transfer agent, shareholder servicing agent and sub-adviser, if any. The Trust acknowledges that the Adviser also acts as the investment adviser of other investment companies.
With respect to any Money Market Fund listed on Schedule A of this Agreement, the Adviser hereby accepts the responsibilities for making the determinations required by Rule 2a-7 under the Act to be made by the Trustees of the Trust and which are delegable by the Trustees pursuant to Paragraph (e) of such Rule, to the extent that the Trustees may hereinafter delegate such responsibilities to the Adviser.
The Adviser may delegate certain of its duties under this Agreement with respect to a Fund to a sub-adviser or sub-advisers, subject to the approval of the Trustees, by entering into sub-advisory agreements (the "Sub-Advisory Agreements") with one or more sub-advisers. The Adviser is solely responsible for payment of any fees or other charges arising from such delegation and the Trust shall have no liability therefor. Consistent with the provisions of the Act and any applicable exemption thereto, the Trust may enter into Sub-Advisory Agreements or amend Sub-Advisory Agreements without the approval of the shareholders of the affected Fund.
To the extent required by the laws of any state in which the Trust is subject to an expense guarantee limitation, if the aggregate expenses of any Fund in any fiscal year exceed the specified expense limitation ratios for that year (calculated on a daily basis), Adviser agrees to waive such portion of its advisory fee in excess of the limitation, but such waiver shall not exceed the full amount of the advisory fee for such year except as may be elected by Adviser in its discretion. For this purpose, aggregate expenses of a Fund shall include the compensation of Adviser and all other normal expenses and charges, but shall exclude interest, taxes, brokerage fees on Fund transactions, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the distribution of Trust shares, and extraordinary expenses including litigation expenses. In the event any amounts are so contributed by Adviser to the Trust, the Trust agrees to reimburse Adviser, provided that such reimbursement does not result in increasing the Trust's aggregate expenses above the aforementioned expense limitation ratios.
3. Expenses
The Adviser shall pay all of its expenses arising from the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and shall pay any salaries, fees and expenses of the Trustees and any officers of the Trust who are employees of the Adviser. The Adviser shall not be required to pay any other expenses of the Trust, including, but not limited to direct charges relating to the purchase and sale of Fund securities, interest charges, fees and expenses of independent attorneys and auditors, taxes and governmental fees, cost of stock certificates and any other expenses (including clerical expenses) of issue, sale, repurchase or redemption of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses of printing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, expenses of data processing and related services, shareholder recordkeeping and shareholder account service, expenses of printing and filing reports and other documents filed with governmental agencies, expenses of printing and distributing Prospectuses, fees and disbursements of transfer agents and custodians, expenses of disbursing dividends and distributions, fees and expenses of Trustees who are not employees of the Adviser or its affiliates, membership dues in the investment company trade association, insurance premiums and extraordinary expenses such as litigation expenses.
4. Compensation
As compensation for services performed and the facilities and personnel provided by the Adviser under this Agreement, the Trust will pay to the Adviser a single, unified fee, accrued daily and payable monthly on the average daily net assets in each Fund, in accordance with Schedule B hereto; provided that, in the case of each Fund identified in Schedule C hereto that has a wholly owned subsidiary (which subsidiary is obligated to pay an investment advisory fee to the Adviser based on the same formula as set forth in Schedule B for its parent Fund), 1) the Funds' average daily net assets for purposes of the foregoing shall include the average daily net assets of its subsidiary and 2) the fee payable hereunder with respect to that Fund, as calculated pursuant to the foregoing, shall be reduced by the amount of the investment advisory fee paid to the Adviser by its subsidiary under the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, with respect to each such Fund and its subsidiary, the Adviser shall receive the same aggregate fee under this Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement with that subsidiary as if the subsidiary's assets were directly held by the Fund.
Upon any termination of this Agreement on a day other than the last day of the month, the fee for the period from the beginning of the month in which termination occurs to the date of termination shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to the full month.
5. Purchase and Sale of Securities
The Adviser shall purchase securities from or through and sell securities to or through such persons, brokers or dealers (including affiliated brokers or dealers) as the Adviser shall deem appropriate to carry out the policies with respect to Fund transactions as set forth in the Trust's Registration Statement and its current Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information, as amended from time to time, or as the Trustees may direct from time to time.
Nothing herein shall prohibit the Trustees from approving the payment by the Trust of additional compensation to others for consulting services, supplemental research and security, and economic analysis.
6. Term of Agreement
This Agreement will become effective as to the Trust upon execution or, if later, the date that initial capital for the Trust is first provided to it and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, will continue in full force and effect for two years from the date of its execution. With regard to any Fund added to the Trust by execution of an Addendum to Schedule A, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the date of such execution. Thereafter, if not terminated as to a Fund, this Agreement will continue as to each Fund from year to year through June 30th of each successive year, provided that such continuation is specifically approved at least annually (i) by the Trustees by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined by the Act) of such Fund with respect to which renewal is to be effected, and (ii) by a majority of the non-interested Trustees by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal. Any approval of this Agreement or the renewal thereof with respect to a Fund by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund, or by the Trustees which shall include a majority of the non-interested Trustees, shall be effective to continue this Agreement with respect to that Fund notwithstanding (a) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved as to any other Fund, or (b) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust as a whole. However, the addition or deletion of a Fund reflecting changes that have been formally approved by resolution by the Board of Trustees will not require approval of an amendment to this Agreement by the Board of Trustees.
7. Termination
This Agreement may be terminated at any time as to a Fund, without payment of any penalty, by the Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the Act) of such Fund on sixty (60) days' written notice to the Adviser. Similarly, the Adviser may terminate this Agreement without penalty on like notice to the Trust provided, however, that this Agreement may not be terminated by the Adviser unless another investment advisory agreement has been approved by the Trust in accordance with the Act, or after six months' written notice, whichever is earlier. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Act).
8. Reports
The Adviser shall report to the Trustees, or to any committee or officers of the Trust acting pursuant to the authority of the Trustees, at such times and in such detail as shall be reasonable and as the Trustees may deem appropriate in order to enable the Trustees to determine that the investment policies of each Fund are being observed and implemented and that the obligations of the Adviser under this Agreement are being fulfilled. Any investment program undertaken by the Adviser pursuant to this Agreement and any other activities undertaken by the Adviser on behalf of the Trust shall at all times be subject to any directives of the Trustees or any duly constituted committee or officer of the Trust acting pursuant to the authority of the Trustees.
The Adviser shall furnish all such information as may reasonably be necessary for the Trustees to evaluate the terms of this Agreement.
9. Records
The Trust is responsible for maintaining and preserving for such period or periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations, such accounts, books and other documents that constitute the records forming the basis for all reports, including financial statements required to be filed pursuant to the Act and for the Trust's auditor's certification relating thereto. The Trust and the Adviser agree that in furtherance of the recordkeeping responsibilities of the Trust under Section 31 of the Act and the rules thereunder, the Adviser will maintain records and ledgers and will preserve such records in the form and for the period prescribed in Rule 31a-2 of the Act for each Fund.
The Adviser and the Trust agree that all accounts, books and other records maintained and preserved by each as required hereby shall be subject at any time, and from time to time, to such reasonable periodic, special and other examinations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Trust's auditors, the Trust or any representative of the Trust, or any governmental agency or other instrumentality having regulatory authority over the Trust. It is expressly understood and agreed that the books and records maintained by the Adviser on behalf of each Fund shall, at all times, remain the property of the Trust.
10. Liability and Indemnification
In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties ("disabling conduct") hereunder on the part of the Adviser (and its officers, directors, agents, employees, controlling persons, shareholders and any other person or entity affiliated with Adviser), Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholder of the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder including, without limitation, any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any of them in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services. Except for such disabling conduct or liability incurred under Section 36(b) of the Act, the Trust shall indemnify Adviser (and its officers, directors, agents, employees, controlling persons, shareholders and any other person or entity affiliated with Adviser) from any liability arising from Adviser's conduct under this Agreement.
Indemnification to Adviser or any of its personnel or affiliates shall be made when (i) a final decision on the merits is rendered by a court or other body before whom the proceeding was brought, that the person to be indemnified was not liable by reason of disabling conduct or Section 36(b) or, (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts, that the person to be indemnified was not liable by reason of disabling conduct, by (a) the vote of a majority of a quorum of Trustees who are neither "interested persons" of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Act nor parties to the proceeding ("disinterested, non-party Trustees"), or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. The Trust may, by vote of a majority of the disinterested, non-party Trustees, advance attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred by officers, Trustees, investment advisers or principal underwriters, in defending a proceeding upon the undertaking by or on behalf of the person to be indemnified to repay the advance unless it is ultimately determined that such person is entitled to indemnification. Such advance shall be subject to at least one of the following: (1) the person to be indemnified shall provide a security for the undertaking, (2) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful advances, or (3) a majority of a quorum of the disinterested, non-party Trustees, or an independent legal counsel in a written opinion shall determine, based on a review of readily available facts, that there is reason to believe that the person to be indemnified ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification.
11. Miscellaneous
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not be construed to require, or to impose any duty upon either of the parties, to do anything in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.
A copy of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust is on file with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and notice is hereby given that this instrument is executed on behalf of the Trustees as Trustees, and is not binding upon any of the Trustees, officers, or shareholders of the Trust individually but binding only upon the assets and property of the Trust. With respect to any claim by the Adviser for recovery of that portion of the investment management fee (or any other liability of the Trust arising hereunder) allocated to a particular Fund, whether in accordance with the express terms hereof or otherwise, the Adviser shall have recourse solely against the assets of that Fund to satisfy such claim and shall have no recourse against the assets of any other Fund for such purpose.
In Witness Whereof, the Trust and the Adviser have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized officers as of June 24, 2013, effective that date.

Amendment to
Amended and Restated Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
Between JNL Series Trust and 
Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
This Amendment is made by and between JNL Series Trust, a Massachusetts business trust ("Trust") and Jackson National Asset Management, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("Adviser").
Whereas, the Trust and the Adviser entered into an Amended and Restated Investment Advisory and Management Agreement effective as of the 1st day of July, 2013, as amended September 16, 2013 and April 28, 2014 ("Agreement"), whereby the Adviser agreed to perform certain investment advisory services, on behalf of several separate series of shares (each a "Fund") of the Trust, as listed on Schedule A of the Agreement.
Whereas, the parties have agreed to amend the following section of the Agreement:
Section 6. "Term of Agreement"
Now Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement, as follows:
Delete Section 6. "Term of Agreement" in its entirety, and replace it with the following:
6. Term of Agreement
This Agreement will become effective as to the Trust upon execution or, if later, the date that initial capital for the Trust is first provided to it and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, will continue in full force and effect for two years from the date of its execution. With regard to any Fund added to the Trust by execution of an Addendum to Schedule A, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the date of such execution. Thereafter, if not terminated as to a Fund, this Agreement will continue as to each Fund from year to year through September 30th of each successive year, provided that such continuation is specifically approved at least annually (i) by the Trustees by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined by the Act) of such Fund with respect to which renewal is to be effected, and (ii) by a majority of the non-interested Trustees by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal. Any approval of this Agreement or the renewal thereof with respect to a Fund by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund, or by the Trustees which shall include a majority of the non-interested Trustees, shall be effective to continue this Agreement with respect to that Fund notwithstanding (a) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved as to any other Fund, or (b) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust as a whole. However, the addition or deletion of a Fund reflecting changes that have been formally approved by resolution by the Board of Trustees will not require approval of an amendment to this Agreement by the Board of Trustees.
In Witness Whereof, the Adviser and the Trust have caused this Amendment to be executed as of this 6th day of June 2014, effective June 4, 2014.

Amendment to
Amended and Restated Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
Between JNL Series Trust and 
Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
 This Amendment is made by and between JNL Series Trust, a Massachusetts business trust (the "Trust") and Jackson National Asset Management, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (the "Adviser"). 
APPENDIX C
Amended and Restated
Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement
This Agreement is effective as of the 1st day of May, 2006, and Amended and Restated effective as of the 1st day of December, 2012, by and between Jackson National Asset Management, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company and registered investment adviser ("Adviser"), and Franklin Advisers, Inc., a California corporation and registered investment adviser ("Sub-Adviser").
Whereas, Adviser is the investment manager for the JNL Series Trust (the "Trust"), an open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"); 
Whereas, the Adviser represents that it has entered into an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement effective as of January 31, 2001, Amended and Restated as of the 28th day of February, 2012, and further Amended and Restated as of the 1st day of December, 2012 ("Management Agreement") with the Trust; and
Whereas, Adviser desires to retain Sub-Adviser as Adviser's agent to furnish investment advisory services to the investment portfolios of the Trust listed on Schedule A hereto ("each a Fund"). 
Now, Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
During the term of this Agreement, the Adviser agrees to furnish the Sub-Adviser at its principal office all proxy statements, reports to shareholders, sales literature or other materials prepared for distribution to shareholders of each Fund, prospects of each Fund or the public that refer to the Fund in any way, prior to the use thereof, and the Adviser shall not use any such materials if the Sub-Adviser reasonably objects in writing within five business days (or such other period as may be mutually agreed) after receipt thereof. The Sub-Adviser's right to object to such materials is limited to the portions of such materials that expressly relate to the Sub-Adviser, its services and its clients. The Adviser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that materials prepared by its employees or agents or its affiliates that refer to the Sub-Adviser or its clients in any way are consistent with those materials previously approved by the Sub-Adviser as referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph. Sales literature may be furnished to the Sub-Adviser by e-mail, first class or overnight mail, facsimile transmission equipment or hand delivery.
Adviser will furnish the Sub-Adviser with copies of all amendments of or supplements to the foregoing within a reasonable time before they become effective. Any amendments or supplements that impact the management of the Funds will not be deemed effective with respect to the Sub-Adviser until the Sub-Adviser's approval thereof.
Adviser will not act in a manner that would result in Sub-Adviser failing to maintain the required diversification and if the failure to diversify is inadvertent, Jackson National Life Insurance Company and any of its affiliates investing in the Funds, as owner of the assets in the Funds, shall in good faith and in conjunction with Sub-Adviser follow the procedures specified in Treas. Reg. Section 1.817-5(a)(2) and Revenue Procedure 92-25 (or its successor) to request relief from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, and that in such an event Adviser shall work in conjunction with Sub-Adviser in the preparation of any request for relief or closing agreement and, to the extent that Adviser is seeking indemnification under Section 11 hereof, no filings or agreements shall be made with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service without the prior written approval of Sub-Adviser. 
The Adviser agrees that the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any failure to recommend the purchase or sale of any security on behalf of any Fund on the basis of any information which might, in the Sub-Adviser's opinion, constitute a violation of any federal or state laws, rules or regulations.
The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it:
Consistent with this policy, the Sub-Adviser, in selecting broker-dealers and negotiating commission rates, will take all relevant factors into consideration, including, but not limited to: the best price available; the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; the broker's execution capabilities and any research provided by the broker that aids the Sub-Adviser's investment decision-making process. Subject to such policies and procedures as the Trust's Board of Trustees may determine, the Sub-Adviser shall have discretion to effect investment transactions for each Fund through broker-dealers (including, to the extent permissible under applicable law, broker-dealer affiliates) who provide brokerage and/or research services, as such services are defined in section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and to cause such Fund to pay any such broker-dealers an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage or research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular investment transaction or the Sub-Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to such Fund and other accounts to which the Sub-Adviser exercises investment discretion (as such term is defined in section 3(a)(35) of the 1934 Act). Allocation of orders placed by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of a Fund to such broker-dealers shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine in good faith in conformity with its responsibilities under applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Sub-Adviser will submit reports on brokerage placements to the Adviser as reasonably requested by the Adviser, in such form as may be mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, indicating the broker-dealers to whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefor. 
Each Fund (and the Adviser with respect to the Fund) is excluded from the definition of a commodity pool operator under CFTC Rule 4.5. In order to ensure compliance with the requirements of Rule 4.5, the Adviser promises that: (1) the Fund will not be, and has not been, marketing participations to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options, or swaps markets (as these terms are used by Rule 4.5 and interpreted by the CFTC); (2) the Adviser will make and maintain all filings required by Rule 4.5; and (3) the Adviser will take all other actions required to qualify for the exclusion provided by Rule 4.5 for the Funds, other than as provided by Section 19 below. The Adviser will furnish the Sub-Adviser with a copy of the notice of eligibility filed pursuant to Rule 4.5 (c) with respect to such exclusion, or, if more recent, the most recent annual notice affirming the basis of such eligibility that has been filed pursuant to Rule 4.5(c)(5), and any other documentation or assurances the Sub-Adviser may reasonably request with respect to the Fund's reliance on Rule 4.5.
The Adviser also agrees to promptly update the above referenced items in order to ensure their accuracy, completeness and/or effectiveness.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  i)  they each are subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the Confidential Information;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ii)  they each will use the same degree of care to protect the confidentiality of all Confidential Information they receive as they use to protect their own confidential and proprietary information which they do not wish to have published or disseminated, provided, however, in no event will any party use less than a reasonable degree of care to protect any Confidential Information received;   
[END TABLE]
Each party agrees to immediately notify the other party if they learn of any use of the Confidential Information by the other party's employees, agents or clients for purpose(s) other than as provided in this section or as required for investment advisory services or administrative services to the Fund, or that would otherwise violate this section. In the event that a party receives a request, demand, order or requisition requiring the disclosure of Confidential Information from any judicial, governmental or regulatory body, they shall promptly (and, to the extent possible, prior to disclosing any Confidential Information) notify the other party of such request, demand, order or requisition. In the event that a party is unable to obtain a protective order or other remedy to prevent the disclosure of any or all of the Confidential Information, the other party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which they are legally required to provide. Each party acknowledges that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy of any breach of the provisions in this section and, accordingly, without prejudice to any and all other rights or remedies, each party acknowledges that the other party and its affiliates or any other entity to which the Confidential Information pertains shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the provisions of this section.

8.2 The Administrator agrees to keep confidential all information (whether written or oral), ideas, techniques, and materials supplied by the other party, and shall not distribute the same to any other parties, at any time, except with the express written consent of the other party. The Administrator agrees to discontinue use of and destroy, where applicable, all information, ideas, techniques, and materials supplied by the other party upon termination of this Agreement. The Administrator acknowledges that certain information made available to the other party may be deemed nonpublic personal information under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other federal and state privacy laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, "Privacy Laws").

9. The Administrator's Actions In Reliance On Funds' Instructions, Legal Opinions, Etc.; Funds' Compliance With Laws.
9.1 The Administrator may at any time apply to an officer of the Trust for instructions, and may consult with legal counsel for a Fund or with the Administrator's own legal counsel, in respect of any matter arising in connection with this Agreement; and the Administrator shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith and with due care in accordance with such instructions or with the advice or opinion of such legal counsel. The Administrator shall be protected in acting upon any such instructions, advice, or opinion and upon any other paper or document delivered by a Fund or such legal counsel which the Administrator believes to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper person or persons, and the Administrator shall not be held to have notice of any change of status or authority of any officer or representative of the Trust, until receipt of written notice thereof from the Trust.
9.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in any separate agreement between the parties and except for the accuracy of information furnished to each Fund by the Administrator, each Fund assumes full responsibility for the preparation, contents, filing and distribution of its Prospectus and SAI.
10. Services To Other Clients
Nothing herein contained shall limit the freedom of the Administrator or any affiliated person of the Administrator to render administrative or shareholder services to other investment companies, to act as administrator to other persons, firms, or corporations, or to engage in other business activities.
11. Limitation Of Liability Regarding The Trust
The Administrator shall look only to the assets of each Fund for performance of this Agreement by the Trust on behalf of such Fund, and neither the Trustees of the Trust nor any of the Trust's officers, employees or agents, whether past, present or future shall be personally liable therefor.
12. Indemnification By Fund
Each Fund shall indemnify the Administrator and hold it harmless from and against any and all losses, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the Administrator that result from (i) any claim, action, suit or proceeding in connection with the Administrator's entry into or performance of this Agreement with respect to such Fund; or (ii) any action taken or omission to act committed by the Administrator in the performance of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Fund; or (iii) any action of the Administrator upon instructions believed in good faith by it to have been executed by a duly authorized officer or representative of the Trust with respect to such Fund; provided, that the Administrator shall not be entitled to such indemnification in respect of actions or omissions constituting negligence or misconduct on the part of the Administrator or its employees, agents or contractors. Before confessing any claim against it which may be subject to indemnification by a Fund hereunder, the Administrator shall give such Fund reasonable opportunity to defend against such claim in its own name or in the name of the Administrator.
13. Indemnification By The Administrator
The Administrator shall indemnify each Fund and hold it harmless from and against any and all losses, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by such Fund which result from (i) the Administrator's failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Fund; or (ii) the Administrator's lack of good faith in performing its obligations hereunder with respect to such Fund; or (iii) the Administrator's negligence or misconduct or its employees, agents or contractors in connection herewith with respect to such Fund. A Fund shall not be entitled to such indemnification in respect of actions or omissions constituting negligence or misconduct on the part of that Fund or its employees, agents or contractors other than the Administrator, unless such negligence or misconduct results from or is accompanied by negligence or misconduct on the part of the Administrator, any affiliated person of the Administrator, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person of the Administrator. Before confessing any claim against it which may be subject to indemnification hereunder, a Fund shall give the Administrator reasonable opportunity to defend against such claim in its own name or the name of the Fund.
14. Effect Of Agreement
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require the Trust or any Fund to take any action contrary to the Trust Instrument or By-laws of the Trust or any applicable law, regulation or order to which it is subject or by which it is bound, or to relieve or deprive the Trustees of their responsibility for and control of the conduct of the business and affairs of the Fund or the Trust.
15. Term Of Agreement
This Agreement will become effective as to the Trust upon execution or, if later, the date that initial capital for the Trust is first provided to it and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, will continue in full force and effect for two years from the date of its execution. With regard to any Fund added to the Trust by execution of an Addendum to Schedule A, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the date of such execution. Thereafter, if not terminated as to a Fund, this Agreement will continue as to each Fund from year to year through June 30th of each successive year, provided that such continuation is specifically approved at least annually (i) by the Trustees by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined by the Act) of such Fund with respect to which renewal is to be effected, and (ii) by a majority of the non-interested Trustees by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal. Any approval of this Agreement or the renewal thereof with respect to a Fund by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund, or by the Trustees which shall include a majority of the non-interested Trustees, shall be effective to continue this Agreement with respect to that Fund notwithstanding (a) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved as to any other Fund, or (b) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust as a whole. However, the addition or deletion of a Fund reflecting changes that have been formally approved by resolution by the Board of Trustees will not require approval of an amendment to this Agreement by the Board of Trustees.
16. Amendment Or Assignment Of Agreement
Any amendment to this Agreement shall be in writing signed by the parties hereto; provided, that no such amendment shall be effective unless authorized on behalf of any Fund (i) by resolution of the Trustees, including the vote or written consent of a majority of the Disinterested Trustees, or (ii) by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such Fund.
This Agreement shall terminate automatically and immediately in the event of its assignment; provided, that with the consent of a Fund, the Administrator may subcontract to another person any of its responsibilities with respect to such Fund.
17. Termination Of Agreement
This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party hereto, without the payment of any penalty, upon at least sixty days' prior written notice to the other party; provided, that in the case of termination by any Fund, such action shall have been authorized (i) by resolution of the Trustees, including the vote or written consent of the Disinterested Trustees, or (ii) by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such Fund.
18. Use Of Name
Each Fund hereby agrees that if the Administrator shall at any time for any reason cease to serve as administrator to a Fund, such Fund shall, if and when requested by the Administrator, thereafter refrain from using the name "Jackson National Asset Management, LLC" or the initials "JNAM" in connection with its business or activities, and the foregoing agreement of each Fund shall survive any termination of this Agreement and any extension or renewal thereof.
19. Interpretation And Definition Of Terms
Any question of interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the 1940 Act shall be resolved by reference to such term or provision of the 1940 Act and to interpretation thereof, if any, by the United States courts or, in the absence of any controlling decision of any such court, by rules, regulations or orders of the SEC validly issued pursuant to the 1940 Act. Specifically, the terms "vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities," "interested persons," "assignment" and affiliated person," as used in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them by section 2(a) of the 1940 Act. In addition, when the effect of a requirement of the 1940 Act reflected in any provision of this Agreement is modified, interpreted or relaxed by rule, regulation or order of the SEC, whether of special or general application, such provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order.
20. Choice Of Law
This Agreement is made and to be principally performed in the State of Illinois, and except insofar as the 1940 Act or other federal laws and regulations may be controlling, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Illinois.
21. Captions
The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and in no way define or delineate any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect.
22. Execution On Counterparts
This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
In Witness Whereof, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized and their respective seals to be hereunto affixed, as of the day and year first above written.

Amended and Restated Administration Agreement
Between JNL Series Trust and 
Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
This Amendment is made by and between Jackson National Asset Management, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("Administrator"), and JNL Series Trust, a Massachusetts business trust ("Trust").
Whereas, the Trust and the Administrator entered into an Amended and Restated Administration Agreement effective as of July 1, 2013 ("Agreement"), whereby the Administrator agreed to perform certain administrative services to several separate series of shares (each a "Fund") of the Trust, as listed on Schedule A of the Agreement.
Whereas, the Trust and the Administrator have agreed to amend the Agreement.
Now Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows:
1. Paragraph 2.1.7 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:
2.1.7 Legal and Accounting Fees. All charges for routine, day-to-day services and expenses of the Fund's legal counsel and independent auditors excluding, however, the charges for services and expenses of independent legal counsel to the Trustees who are not "interested persons" (as such term is defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) of the Funds (the "Disinterested Trustees") and further excluding any charges for services and expenses of the Fund's legal counsel and independent auditors in connection with nonrecurring and extraordinary expenses of the type described in Section 2.2.4 herein. In addition, all audit and tax return related charges and expenses;
2. Paragraph 2.2.4 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:
2.2.4 Nonrecurring and Extraordinary Expenses. Such nonrecurring and extraordinary expenses as may arise, including, but not limited to, the costs of actions, suits, or proceedings to which a Fund is a party, the expenses a Fund may incur as a result of its legal obligation to provide indemnification to the Trust's officers, Trustees and agents, the costs associated with one-time transactions, such as terminating or merging a Fund, and any other expenses as approved by the Board of Trustees;
In Witness Whereof, the Administrator and the Trust have caused this Amendment to be executed as of September 5, 2013, effective as of September 5, 2013.
Amendment to 
Amended and Restated Administration Agreement
Between JNL Series Trust and 
Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
This Amendment is made by and between Jackson National Asset Management, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("Administrator"), and JNL Series Trust, a Massachusetts business trust ("Trust").
Whereas, the Trust and the Administrator entered into an Amended and Restated Administration Agreement effective as of July 1, 2013, as amended September 5, 2013, September 16, 2013 and April 28, 2014 ("Agreement"), whereby the Administrator agreed to perform certain administrative services to several separate series of shares (each a "Fund") of the Trust, as listed on Schedule A of the Agreement.
Whereas, the parties have agreed to amend the following section of the Agreement:
Section 15. "Term of Agreement".
Now Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement, as follows:
Delete Section 15. "Term of Agreement" in its entirety, and replace it with the following:
15. Term Of Agreement
This Agreement will become effective as to the Trust upon execution or, if later, the date that initial capital for the Trust is first provided to it and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, will continue in full force and effect for two years from the date of its execution. With regard to any Fund added to the Trust by execution of an Addendum to Schedule A, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the date of such execution. Thereafter, if not terminated as to a Fund, this Agreement will continue as to each Fund from year to year through September 30th of each successive year, provided that such continuation is specifically approved at least annually (i) by the Trustees by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined by the Act) of such Fund with respect to which renewal is to be effected, and (ii) by a majority of the non-interested Trustees by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such renewal. Any approval of this Agreement or the renewal thereof with respect to a Fund by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund, or by the Trustees which shall include a majority of the non-interested Trustees, shall be effective to continue this Agreement with respect to that Fund notwithstanding (a) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved as to any other Fund, or (b) that this Agreement or the renewal thereof has not been so approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust as a whole. However, the addition or deletion of a Fund reflecting changes that have been formally approved by resolution by the Board of Trustees will not require approval of an amendment to this Agreement by the Board of Trustees.
In Witness Whereof, the Administrator and the Trust have caused this Amendment to be executed as of this 6th day of June 2014, effective June 4, 2014.
