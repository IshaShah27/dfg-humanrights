PROXY STATEMENT 
for the 
2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held On January 23, 2019 
GENERAL 
Time, Place and Purposes of Meeting 
Our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on Wednesday, January 23, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., central time, at our corporate offices located at 1341 Horton Circle, Arlington, Texas. The purposes of the 2019 Annual Meeting are set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders to which this Proxy Statement is attached. D.R. Horton, Inc. is referred to as "D.R. Horton," the "Company," "we," and "our" in this Proxy Statement. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of D.R. Horton. D.R. Horton expects that this Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy will first be released to our stockholders of record on or about December 14, 2018. The cost of this solicitation will be paid by D.R. Horton. The solicitation of proxies will be made primarily by use of the mail. In addition, directors, officers and regular employees of D.R. Horton may make solicitations without special compensation by telephone, facsimile, e-mail or personal interview. They may request banks, brokers, fiduciaries and other persons holding stock in their names, or in the names of their nominees, to forward proxies and proxy materials to their principals and obtain authorization for the execution and return of such proxies to management. D.R. Horton will reimburse such banks, brokers and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for this service. 
Revocation and Voting of Proxies 
Stockholders may vote by marking, signing and dating each proxy card received and returning it in the prepaid envelope, by telephone or electronically through the Internet by following the instructions included on the enclosed proxy card or by casting votes in person at the meeting. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate votes cast by use of a personal identification number. The procedures, which are designed to comply with Delaware law, allow stockholders to appoint a proxy to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Stockholders who hold shares in "street name" through a broker or other nominee may be able to vote by telephone or electronically through the Internet in accordance with the voting instructions provided by that institution. 
Any proxy given may be revoked by a stockholder at any time before it is exercised by filing with D.R. Horton a notice in writing revoking it, by duly executing and returning a proxy bearing a later date or by voting by telephone or Internet. Proxies also may be revoked by any stockholder present at the 2019 Annual Meeting who expresses a desire to vote his or her shares in person. Each shareholder may appoint only one proxy holder or representative to attend the meeting on his or her behalf. If you require directions to our meeting, please contact Investor Relations at (817) 390-8200. Subject to such revocation and except as otherwise stated herein or in the form of proxy, all proxies duly executed and received prior to, or at the time of, the 2019 Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the specifications of the proxies. If no specification is made, proxies will be voted as follows: (i) FOR each of the nominees for election of directors (see Proposal One on page 5), (ii) FOR the adoption of the advisory resolution on executive compensation (see Proposal Two on page 57), and (iii) FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (see Proposal Three on page 61), and at the discretion of the proxy holders on all other matters properly brought before the 2019 Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
Outstanding Shares and Voting Rights 
November 26, 2018 has been set as the record date for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the 2019 Annual Meeting. There were 373,561,443 shares of D.R. Horton's common stock, $.01 par value, issued and outstanding on the record date. On any matter submitted to a stockholder vote, each holder of common stock will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each issued and outstanding share of common stock registered in his or her name on the books of D.R. Horton as of the record date. A list of such stockholders will be available for examination by any stockholder at the offices of D.R. Horton set forth above for at least ten days before the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Quorum Requirement 
The D.R. Horton Bylaws provide that there will be a quorum if the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote are present in person or represented by proxy. The aggregate number of votes entitled to be cast by all stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting, whether those stockholders vote for, against or abstain from voting on any matter, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes, which are described below under "Vote Required," will be considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 
Vote Required 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   NOTICE:    Brokers and banks are not permitted to vote on certain non-routine proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner, as  discussed in more detail below. Proposal One and Proposal Two are non-routine proposals. Therefore, if your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on Proposal  One or Proposal Two unless you provide voting instructions to your broker or bank as described herein.   
   NOTICE:    Brokers and banks are not permitted to vote on certain non-routine proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner, as  discussed in more detail below. Proposal One and Proposal Two are non-routine proposals. Therefore, if your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on Proposal  One or Proposal Two unless you provide voting instructions to your broker or bank as described herein.   
   NOTICE:    Brokers and banks are not permitted to vote on certain non-routine proposals without instructions from the beneficial owner, as  discussed in more detail below. Proposal One and Proposal Two are non-routine proposals. Therefore, if your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on Proposal  One or Proposal Two unless you provide voting instructions to your broker or bank as described herein.   
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name." If a broker or bank holds your shares, you may have received this Proxy Statement directly from them, together with instructions as to how to direct the broker or bank to vote your shares. If you intend to have your vote counted, it is important that you return your voting instructions to your broker or bank. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), a broker or bank has the authority to vote on certain "routine" proposals without voting instructions from the beneficial owner. A "broker non-vote" occurs when the broker or bank is unable to vote on a "non-routine" proposal because it does not have discretionary authority and the beneficial owner has not provided voting instructions. Brokers or banks may not vote on Proposal One or Proposal Two at the 2019 Annual Meeting without voting instructions from the beneficial owner because those proposals are non-routine proposals. Brokers and banks may vote on Proposal Three at the 2019 Annual Meeting without voting instructions from the beneficial owner because this proposal is routine.  The following table reflects the vote required for each proposal and the effect of broker non-votes and abstentions on the vote, assuming a quorum is present at the meeting:

 PROPOSAL ONE 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors currently consists of five members who were elected at the 2018 Annual Meeting and will serve until the 2019 Annual Meeting and until their successors have been elected and qualified. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors our five directors as director nominees, each of whom is listed below under the heading "Nominees for Director." After review and consideration by the Board of Directors, the Board nominated Donald R. Horton, Barbara K. Allen, Brad S. Anderson, Michael R. Buchanan and Michael W. Hewatt, as recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee, for election as directors of D.R. Horton at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Unless otherwise specified in the accompanying proxy, the shares voted by proxy will be voted for each of the persons named below as nominees for election as directors. Nominees who are elected as directors will be elected for one-year terms and will serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and their successors have been elected and qualified. We do not know of any reason why any of the nominees would be unable to serve. However, if any of the nominees is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve as a director at the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board may designate a substitute nominee or reduce the size of the Board. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, the persons named as proxies may vote "FOR" that substitute nominee. 
The D.R. Horton Bylaws require that to be elected, a director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to such nominee in uncontested elections (the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee). In a contested election, where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (which is not the case at the 2019 Annual Meeting), the directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Under the Corporate Governance Principles of the Company, any director who is not elected is required to tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board within a reasonable time following certification of the vote. The Nominating and Governance Committee, which is composed of only independent directors, will consider the resignation offer and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the election results. Thereafter, the Board will promptly publicly disclose in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") its decision regarding the director's resignation offer (including the reason(s) for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable). 
The Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that Stockholders Vote "FOR"

Corporate Governance Standards 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a number of standards to comply with requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the final rules of the NYSE and SEC relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and other corporate governance matters. Our Board has adopted the D.R. Horton Corporate Governance Principles, which contain a number of corporate governance initiatives designed to comply with the NYSE listing standards (the "NYSE Rules") and the rules and regulations of the SEC (the "SEC Rules") relating to corporate governance. The significant corporate governance initiatives adopted by the Board of Directors are discussed below. The Corporate Governance Principles can be found under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links on our website at www.drhorton.com. 
Qualifications and Characteristics for Directors 
The Nominating and Governance Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying nominees for director, including considering potential director candidates who come to the Committee's attention through current officers, directors, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. Once a potential nominee has been identified, the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates whether the nominee has appropriate qualifications and characteristics to become a director in light of the current make-up of the Board of Directors. We do not have a formal or informal diversity policy regarding the selection or qualification of directors. We believe that appropriate director qualifications and characteristics include having directors with diverse backgrounds, education, experiences, expertise and perspectives. These qualifications and characteristics are discussed below. 
Key Qualifications and Experiences.    As a leading national homebuilding company, we believe certain qualifications and experiences are important to the overall composition of our Board. We do not require that each director possess each of the qualifications listed below, but rather we look to whether our Board as a whole possesses these qualifications. 
Real Estate Experience.    We seek to have directors with expertise or key experience in the real estate industry, which includes experience in homebuilding, land development, real estate brokerage and sales, commercial development and leasing, financing and banking in the real estate industry or experience in analyzing or consulting in these key areas. These key qualifications enable our Board to understand key operational aspects related to our business of running a national homebuilding company. 
Business, Management, Accounting and Finance Experience.    We seek to have directors with expertise or key experience in business, management, accounting, finance or similar positions. We believe these key qualifications are important to the Board as it oversees risks in the Company's key functional areas of homebuilding operations, financing and liquidity, financial reporting, internal control and regulatory compliance. 
Strategic Vision and Leadership.    We seek to have directors with expertise or key experiences in positions that require strategic vision, leadership and decision making. We believe directors acquire these key qualifications through experience as executives, managers, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, consultants, analysts or advisors. We believe these key qualifications are important to the Board, as directors with these attributes provide sound business judgment, leadership and strategic vision to the Board and the Company. 
The key qualifications possessed by our nominees are discussed under each nominee's name and profile beginning on page 6. 
Key Characteristics.    In addition to the key qualifications and experiences discussed above, we also believe each member of the Board of Directors should have the following minimum characteristics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• high personal and professional ethical standards, integrity and values;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• commitment to representing the long-term interests of the stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• practical wisdom, mature judgment and collegiality;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• objectivity and inquisitiveness; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willingness to offer his or her resignation in the event of any significant change in personal circumstances that could affect the discharge of his or  her responsibilities as a director, including a change in his or her principal job responsibilities.  
[END TABLE]
Ordinarily, directors who serve as chief executive officers or in equivalent positions for other companies should not serve on more than one other board of a public company in addition to the D.R. Horton Board, and other directors should not serve on more than two other boards of public companies in addition to the D.R. Horton Board. Because of the value the Board places on having directors who are knowledgeable about the Company and its operations, neither the Board nor the Nominating and Governance Committee believes that an arbitrary term limit on director service is appropriate. 
Retirement Age Policy 
On January 25, 2007, our Board adopted a retirement policy for directors. Under the policy, directors may not stand for re-election after they have reached the age of 75. Directors serving on the Board on January 25, 2007, which include all current directors other than Barbara K. Allen, are exempt from this policy. 
Majority Vote Standard and Resignation Policy 
The Company's Bylaws provide that in an uncontested election of directors, a director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected. Any current director who is not re-elected is required to tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board within a reasonable time following certification of the vote. Details regarding the majority vote standard and resignation policy are discussed under "Proposal One — Election of Directors" on page 5. 
Procedures for Nominating or Recommending for Nomination Candidates for Director 
Our Bylaws provide, outside of the proxy access process, that any stockholder may make nominations for the election of directors if notice of such nominations is delivered to the principal executive offices of D.R. Horton not later than the close of business on the 90th calendar day or earlier than the close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. However, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 30 calendar days from the anniversary date of the preceding year's meeting, for notice by the stockholder to be timely, it must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to such meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th calendar day prior to such meeting or the 10th calendar day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is made. Such public disclosure is defined to mean a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or a document publicly filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In addition, the notice must include information specified in our Bylaws, including information concerning the nominee, the stockholder and the beneficial owner, as the case may be. Because no such nominations have been made in accordance with our Bylaws, only the nominations of the Board of Directors may be voted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
On November 2, 2017, the Board of Directors adopted proxy access, which allows a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders owning in the aggregate 3% or more of D.R. Horton's outstanding shares continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the number of directors in office, provided the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in our Bylaws. In order for a stockholder or group of stockholders to nominate a director candidate to be included in D.R. Horton's proxy materials, notice of such nomination must be delivered to the principal executive offices of D.R. Horton not later than the close of business on the 120th calendar day or earlier than the close of business on the 150th calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the date that the definitive proxy statement was first   released to stockholders in connection with the preceding year's annual meeting, and the nomination must otherwise comply with our Bylaws. However, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 30 calendar days from the anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting, for notice by the stockholder to be timely, it must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th calendar day prior to such meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th calendar day prior to such meeting or the 10th calendar day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is made. 
In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee has adopted a policy permitting stockholders to recommend candidates for director for consideration by the committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders on the same basis as candidates identified through other means. Stockholders wishing to recommend candidates for election must give notice to the Nominating and Governance Committee by following the same deadlines for notice to submit a nomination outlined in our Bylaws and described above. Each notice must set forth the same information required by our Bylaws to submit a nomination. All recommended candidates shall, at a minimum, possess the characteristics for directors discussed above. The Nominating and Governance Committee may request additional information to assist in the evaluation of the candidacy of such person. 
Director Independence 
Our Board of Directors is composed of a majority of independent directors in accordance with the NYSE Rules. Our Board made the independence determination of its members based on the "Independence Standards" discussed below. 
Our Board has adopted a set of "Independence Standards," consistent with the NYSE Rules, to aid it in determining whether a member of the Board is independent under the NYSE Rules. In accordance with these Independence Standards, a director must not have a direct or indirect material relationship with the Company or its management, other than as a director. The Independence Standards specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment or affiliation with the Company, its management or its independent auditor. 
The Independence Standards are contained in the Corporate Governance Principles set forth on our website, www.drhorton.com, under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links. These include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is an employee or whose immediate family member is an executive officer of D.R. Horton is not independent until three years after  the end of such employment relationship.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who receives, or whose immediate family member receives, more than $120,000 per year in direct compensation from D.R. Horton, other than  director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), is not independent until three years after he or she ceases to receive  more than $120,000 per year in compensation. Compensation received by an immediate family member for service as a non-executive employee or non-member of senior  management of D.R. Horton will not be considered in determining independence under this test.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director is not independent if (i) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of D.R. Horton's external audit firm,  (ii) the director is a current employee of such firm, (iii) the director's immediate family member is a current employee of such firm and personally works on D.R. Horton's audit, or (iv) the director or an immediate  family member was within the last three years (but is no longer) a partner or employee of such firm and personally worked on D.R. Horton's audit within that time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is employed, or whose immediate family member is employed, as an executive officer of another company where any of D.R. Horton's  present executives serves on that company's compensation committee is not independent until three years after the end of such service or employment relationship.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is an executive officer or an employee, or whose immediate family member is an executive officer, of a company that makes payments to,  or receives payments from, D.R. Horton for property or services in an amount that, in any single fiscal year, exceeds the greater of $1 million or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues, is not independent until three years  after falling below such threshold.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If a director serves as an executive officer, director or trustee of a charitable or educational organization and D.R. Horton's contributions to  the organization are less than $500,000, then the relationship will not be considered to be a material relationship that would impair a director's independence.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of these Independence Standards, an "immediate family member" includes a director's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mother and father-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares the director's home. 
Audit Committee Independence, Financial Literacy and Audit Committee Financial Expert 
In addition to being independent based on the Independence Standards, the NYSE Rules require that each member of an audit committee satisfy additional independence and financial literacy requirements and at least one of these members must satisfy the additional requirement of having accounting or related financial management expertise. This additional requirement can be satisfied by the Board determining that at least one Audit Committee member is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of the SEC Rules. Accordingly, the Corporate Governance Principles contain a set of standards that relate to audit committee independence, financial literacy and audit committee accounting and financial management expertise. Generally, the additional independence standard provides that (i) a member of the Audit Committee or his or her immediate family members are prohibited from receiving any direct or indirect compensation or fee from the Company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Audit Committee, the Board or any other committee of the Board, and (ii) he or she may not be an affiliated person of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Generally, the financial literacy standard provides that the Board, in its business judgment, shall determine if each member is financially literate, taking into account factors such as the member's education, experience and ability to read and understand financial statements of public companies. Also, audit committee financial experts must have five additional attributes, which are (i) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements, (ii) the ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, (iii) experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company's financial statements, or experience actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities, (iv) an understanding of internal control over financial reporting and (v) an understanding of audit committee functions. Altogether, attributes (i) through (v) are referred to as the "Financial Expert Attributes." The audit committee financial expert standards are set forth in the Corporate Governance Principles. 
Compensation Committee Independence 
In addition to being independent based on the Independence Standards, the NYSE Rules require that each member of a compensation committee satisfy additional independence requirements. The NYSE Rules require that the Board consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to the Company that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to (i) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the Company to such director and (ii) whether such director is affiliated with the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the Company. 
Board Determinations 
Based on the independence, financial literacy and financial expert standards discussed above, the Board has determined that Barbara K. Allen, Brad S. Anderson, Michael R. Buchanan, and Michael W. Hewatt are   (i) independent, for purposes of serving as independent members of the Board of Directors and the Nominating and Governance Committees, (ii) independent, for purposes of serving as independent members on the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and (iii) financially literate, for purposes of serving on the Audit Committee. The Board has also determined, as set forth below, that Mr. Hewatt and Mr. Buchanan each have the Financial Expert Attributes described above. 
Mr. Hewatt.    Mr. Hewatt acquired the Financial Expert Attributes primarily through his 47 years of experience working as a certified public accountant for Coopers & Lybrand LLP and Hewatt & Associates, CPAs and its predecessor and successor entities, as applicable. Mr. Hewatt's experience as an auditor provided him active experience in designing and conducting audits and reviewing financial statements, which developed his understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements as well as his abilities to assess the application of such principles in accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves and to evaluate related internal control structures. Although now retired, Mr. Hewatt's active status as a certified public accountant requires him to stay current on pronouncements and advisory notices issued by accounting, auditing and tax regulatory boards and organizations. Mr. Hewatt has additional experience in providing management advisory, tax advisory and tax preparation services, which has provided him with a strong background in the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Hewatt has prepared and issued audit and management advisory reports to the boards of directors of his clients, whereby he has gained an understanding of the functioning of boards of directors and related committees. Mr. Hewatt's clients have included public and private companies, governmental organizations and non-profit organizations. 
Mr. Buchanan.    Mr. Buchanan acquired the Financial Expert Attributes primarily through his experience as a commercial banker in the real estate and homebuilding sectors, including serving as head of Bank of America's national real estate group. Mr. Buchanan's responsibilities as a banker required him to analyze and evaluate financial statements to make credit and lending decisions. In this regard, he developed significant expertise in understanding the integrity of the financial information used to prepare financial statements and how such information should be used to analyze and evaluate a company's financial condition and its ability to meet its debt obligations. As head of the national real estate group at Bank of America, Mr. Buchanan also actively supervised others in conducting financial statement and financial condition analysis and evaluation. 
As provided by the safe harbor contained in the SEC Rules, our audit committee financial experts will not be deemed "experts" for any purpose as a result of being so designated. Such designation does not impose on such persons any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on such persons as members of the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors in the absence of such designation, and such designation does not affect the duties, obligations or liabilities of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors. 
The Board also determined that Mr. Horton, a director nominee, is not independent because he is an executive officer. 
Code of Ethical Conduct for the CEO, CFO and Senior Financial Officers 
In accordance with SEC Rules, the Audit Committee and the Board have adopted the Code of Ethical Conduct for the CEO, CFO and Senior Financial Officers. The Board believes that these individuals must set an exemplary standard of conduct for D.R. Horton, particularly in the areas of accounting, internal accounting control, auditing and finance. The ethics code sets forth ethical standards the designated officers must adhere to and other aspects of accounting, auditing and financial compliance. The full text of the Code of Ethical Conduct for the CEO, CFO and Senior Financial Officers has been posted to the Company's website, www.drhorton.com, under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links. Information relating to any amendment to or waiver of a provision of the Code of Ethical Conduct for the CEO, CFO and Senior Financial Officers will be disclosed on the website within four business days of such amendment or waiver. 
Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Board of Directors has adopted a Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for employees and directors of D.R. Horton in accordance with the NYSE Rules. The Board adopted the Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to provide guidance to the Board and management in areas of ethical business conduct and risk and to provide guidance to employees and directors by helping them recognize and deal with ethical issues including, but not limited to, (i) conflicts of interest, (ii) corporate opportunities, (iii) confidentiality, (iv) fair dealing, (v) protection of corporate assets, (vi) compliance with rules and regulations, including insider trading of securities, and (vii) confidential reporting of unethical behavior and hotline telephone numbers. The Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found on the Company's website under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links. 
Complaint Procedures For Accounting, Internal Control, Auditing and Financial Matters 
In accordance with SEC Rules, the Audit Committee has established procedures for (i) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal control, auditing or financial matters (collectively, "Accounting Matters") and (ii) the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable Accounting Matters. The Audit Committee oversees treatment of complaints and concerns in this area. The full text of the Complaint Procedures For Accounting, Internal Control, Auditing and Financial Matters has been posted to the Company's website under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links. 
Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors 
In accordance with the NYSE Rules, the non-management members of the Board of Directors have held and will continue to hold regularly scheduled executive sessions of these independent directors. Michael R. Buchanan, Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee and Presiding Director, presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors. During fiscal 2018, the non-management directors met three times in executive session, without members of management present. 
Communications with the Board of Directors and Stockholder Engagement 
Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to contact any member of our Board may send their correspondence to the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee, who also serves as the Presiding Director. Send communications to: Presiding Director c/o Thomas B. Montano, Vice President, Corporate Compliance Officer and Secretary, D.R. Horton, Inc., 1341 Horton Circle, Arlington, Texas 76011. Communications will be promptly forwarded to such Board member(s) or the Presiding Director as applicable. The Presiding Director is available for consultation and direct communications with larger shareholders, and reports these and all other communications to the Board on a quarterly basis. Further information may be obtained on the Company's website under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links. 
Our executive management team actively engages in communications throughout the year with stockholders of all ownership levels. Generally these communications involve participating in investor presentations and question and answer sessions, meeting with investors and stockholders one-on-one and in small groups, and responding to investor and stockholder letters, emails and telephone calls. Management's discussions with stockholders and the investment community address numerous aspects of our business and matters of importance or concern to our stockholders. When investors or stockholders ask our executive team to share an observation, question or comment with our Board, they do, so that the Board can then consider the matter as part of its governance responsibilities. 
Board Leadership Structure, Board's Role in Risk Oversight and Board and Committee Meetings 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board of Directors operates under the leadership of our executive Chairman of the Board and founder, Donald R. Horton. Mr. Horton has been executive Chairman of the Board of the Company and its predecessor companies since 1978. We do not have a policy that requires the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO be separated, but we have had a separate Chairman of the Board and CEO since 1998. We believe the separation of these positions is appropriate at this time as it allows our executive Chairman to focus on overall strategy and   vision while leading the Board and the Company in overseeing key risk and management issues facing the Board and the Company. We further believe that Mr. Horton's extensive experience in the homebuilding industry enables him to provide valuable insight and leadership to both the Board and the Company. Mr. Horton's role as an executive officer also benefits the Board and the Company as he works with key officers of the Company to implement the Board's strategies and oversight functions on a daily basis. 
Our Nominating and Governance Committee, which is composed of four independent directors, oversees our corporate governance, and we have taken a number of measures that collectively provide for our effective corporate governance. Our independent directors meet regularly throughout the year in executive session to encourage open communication and discussion among the independent directors without the presence of management. The Presiding Director chairs these meetings, serves as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, and has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors. Overall, the Board is composed of four independent directors and one management director. The Board has designated four primary committees that are responsible for various duties of the Board or its Committees, as applicable. The four committees of the Board are the Nominating and Governance Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Executive Committee. The Committees of the Board are discussed in more detail under the heading "Committees of the Board" on page 17. Each of the Committee Chairs, the Presiding Director and Chairman are solicited for their input on meeting agendas for the Board. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board and Board Committees have overall risk oversight responsibility of the Company, but do not provide day-to-day risk management of the Company, which is the responsibility of our key officers and managers. The risk management process established and overseen by the Company's executive management includes centralized corporate review of the market, real estate, financial, legal and environmental risks associated with each transaction and management approval of funds disbursed. Because of the manner in which the Board and Committees oversee risk, the Board's role in risk oversight does not have an effect on the Board's leadership structure. Risk oversight is reviewed in the risk areas of the Company listed below. 
Homebuilding Operations.    Our ability to build and sell homes that meet buyer demand is heavily impacted by our ability to control, buy and develop land and lots in a cost effective manner. As a result, we use substantial financial resources to control, buy and develop land and lots. We control the amount of financial resources used in the acquisition of land and lots through a process which requires divisional, regional and corporate approval before financial resources are authorized for this purpose. Corporate approval includes review by corporate legal and accounting personnel and approval by our Chairman, CEO or executive officers. Our chief financial officer and chief legal officer both report to the Board regarding our process of reviewing, approving and funding land and lot acquisitions. We believe this process adequately manages the risk related to our land and lot acquisitions. 
Financing and Liquidity.    Our financing and liquidity positions may fluctuate due to changes in the homebuilding industry and in home sales demand. Our Board oversees financing and liquidity risk by regularly monitoring our financial and liquidity position to ensure we maintain the financial resources needed to fund our homebuilding operations and other financing and operating expenses. At each quarterly meeting, management reviews information related to the Company's financial and liquidity position with the Board, which includes projected short and long-term financing and liquidity needs. To further manage risk in this area, the Board approves a limit on the amount of debt and equity that may be repurchased each year. Any debt or equity issuance or debt or equity repurchase above the approved limit must be separately approved by the Board. We believe these procedures provide adequate risk oversight of financing and liquidity matters affecting the Company. 
Financial Reporting, Internal Control and Regulatory Compliance. 
Audit Committee Risk Oversight.    The Audit Committee of the Board provides risk oversight with respect to financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, internal audit and related regulatory compliance matters. Each quarter, our Audit Committee discusses with our independent auditor its review of our interim financial information and, after our fiscal year-end, discusses its audit of our annual consolidated financial   statements, including our procedures on internal control over financial reporting. Also, during the fiscal year, our Audit Committee meets in private session (without the presence of management) with our independent auditor to discuss any matters related to the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and review of our internal control over financial reporting. 
Each quarter, our Audit Committee meets with our director of internal audit and reviews the results of the internal audits of the Company's operating divisions and other key control areas performed during the quarter. Each year, the Audit Committee reviews and approves the internal audit plan for the forthcoming fiscal year. The internal audit plan is designed using a risk-based approach focusing on key risk areas in the Company's homebuilding and financial services operations and other key control areas. During the fiscal year, the Audit Committee meets in private session (without the presence of management) with our internal audit director. 
Throughout the fiscal year, our Audit Committee invites guest speakers to give presentations on a variety of topics related to recent or anticipated changes to accounting rules and regulations, tax laws and regulations, corporate governance and financial reform rules and regulations. By staying informed, the Audit Committee is able to oversee the Company's compliance with regulatory issues in these areas, and to discuss with management any actions necessary to maintain or become compliant with such regulatory matters. 
Compensation Risk Oversight.    The Compensation Committee provides risk oversight with respect to compensation of the Company's employees, including the named executive officers and other key officers, with the assistance of the Board. We regularly review the Company's compensation policies and practices and believe that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We believe we have established a short and long-term compensation program that properly incentivizes desired performance and mitigates inappropriate risk-taking. We believe the following compensation components help us achieve this balance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary:  We set fixed base salaries in amounts that we believe are commensurate with the level of experience, responsibility and tenure of the executive. We believe that providing an appropriate base  salary mitigates inappropriate risk-taking by providing a fixed and certain level of semi-monthly income.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Bonus Plan:  With respect to our Chairman, CEO and COO, we provide annual incentive bonus opportunities based on various performance goals. Recent performance goals were based on pre-tax income. Our CFO is awarded an annual discretionary bonus based on his responsibilities. Final payout of these annual awards is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Their discretion can be used to  alter payouts when the Committee believes levels achieved result in an inappropriate level of annual pay when balanced with the total compensation package and taking into consideration the Company's and the executive's performance. We  believe we mitigate risk related to the annual performance goals through the approval process with respect to the final payout of these awards, the quarterly review of our financial statements by our management and through our internal control over  financial reporting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Long-Term Bonus Plan:  With respect to our Chairman, CEO, COO and CFO, we use a combination of equity awards in the form of performance restricted stock units and time-based restricted stock units to incentivize  performance on key operational and financial goals important to the Company and its stockholders over a period longer than one fiscal year. We believe the long-term nature of these performance awards mitigates risk because the level of performance  achieved is analyzed over a number of fiscal years (typically three), thereby allowing us to take into account any short-term or one-time events that may not be sustainable over a longer period.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Stock Options:  We use stock options as a component of long-term compensation to incent performance and to serve as a retention tool. We believe time-based vesting of our stock options creates a continuing  incentive to grow value in the Company stock price, balancing out the risk taking incentives that might otherwise apply to performance-based options. We mitigate risk related to granting stock options by not granting stock options in coordination  with the release of material non-public information. Further, we have several levels of review when stock options are approved and granted, including approval by the Compensation Committee and review by  corporate legal, human resources and accounting personnel to ensure the terms of the stock options approved match the terms of the stock options issued. We have not issued stock options in the past three fiscal years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Restricted Stock Units:  We use restricted stock units as a component of long-term compensation to incent performance and to serve as a retention tool. We believe time-based vesting of our restricted stock units creates  a continuing incentive to grow value in the Company stock price, balancing out the risk taking incentives that might otherwise apply to performance-based units. We mitigate risk related to granting restricted stock units by not granting restricted  stock units in coordination with the release of material non-public information. Further, we have several levels of review when restricted stock units are approved and granted, including approval by the  Compensation Committee and review by corporate legal, human resources and accounting personnel to ensure the terms of the restricted stock units approved match the terms of the restricted stock units issued.  
[END TABLE]

 Performance Goals:  The Compensation Committee has selected a variety of short and long-term operating and financial performance goals to incent performance and to drive increased Company operating and financial  results on these goals. The performance goals tied to the annual cash bonus and restricted stock unit bonus programs relate to consolidated pre-tax income, relative return on investment, relative gross profit,  relative selling, general and administrative expense and relative total shareholder return. The Company has established appropriate controls around the determination of the components that define these goals which mitigate risk related to monitoring  the actual performance of these goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Discretion and Clawback:  We further mitigate compensation risk by giving the Compensation Committee sole discretion to reduce the final payout on a portion of the total compensation awarded. The Compensation Committee  maintains sole discretion to reduce the final payout for the Annual Bonus Plan. The Committee does not have sole discretion with respect to the annual salary, stock options and time-based restricted stock units because these items are fixed.  Additionally, the Committee does not have discretion with respect to the performance-based restricted stock units.

Executive Summary – Key Operating and Financial Results 
The homebuilding business requires long-term planning and implementation of operating strategies over several years to deliver successful operating and financial results. Accordingly, in the table below and summary that follows, we set forth key operating and financial results of the Company for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. For the 17th consecutive fiscal year, we closed more homes than any other homebuilder in the United States. Our pre-tax income increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016, and we believe our business is well-positioned for the future based on our land and finished lot position, inventory of available homes, strong balance sheet and liquidity position and broad geographic operating base. The fiscal 2018 compensation received by our executives reflects their contribution to the Company's improved financial and operating results.

For a more detailed discussion of our fiscal 2018 financial results, including the calculation of homebuilding return on inventory and homebuilding debt to total capital, please see the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on pages 27 through 62 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 16, 2018. 
Advisory Vote and Process for Determining Compensation 
2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
At our last Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 24, 2018, our stockholders voted in favor of a resolution to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables, notes and narrative in our Proxy Statement for the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Approximately 95.50% of votes cast voted in favor of the advisory vote on executive compensation. The Compensation Committee evaluated the results of the 2018 advisory vote and did not make any changes to our executive compensation program and policies as a result of the vote. 
Authority and Role of Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee evaluates performance, approves compensation for our Chairman and our CEO and makes compensation recommendations to the Board with respect to other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee also administers our equity programs, which include awards under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and all other compensation plans that are intended to qualify as performance-based. Our equity and compensation plans are discussed under the heading "Incentive Bonus Plans" on page 40. Our Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any or all of its responsibilities to a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee comprised of at least two members and, in certain other circumstances, to any other committee of directors of the Company. The duties of the Compensation Committee are summarized under the heading "Compensation Committee" on page 17 and are more fully set forth in the Compensation Committee Charter, which is available on our website under the Investor Relations and Corporate Governance links. 
Role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Our Chairman and our CEO review and discuss salary and bonus compensation of our other named executive officers and our Chairman makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the   compensation of our executive officers, other than for himself. The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations when making its recommendations to the Board. At the request of the Compensation Committee, our Chairman also provides a recommendation concerning the annual base salary and incentive bonus program for our CEO. 
Review of Compensation 
We review the compensation of our executive officers on a regular basis. With respect to fiscal 2018 executive compensation, the Compensation Committee formally met in October, November and December of 2017, and in January, March, April, July, September, October, November and December of 2018 to review and discuss compensation matters. In addition, the Compensation Committee has discussions with management during the year regarding these matters. To assist the Compensation Committee, the Company engages the services of Equilar, a leading third-party provider of financial and executive compensation data. Utilizing the data provided by Equilar, the committee reviews the compensation of executives of publicly-traded companies, including our peer group and other public companies within a range of our market capitalization and industrial classification code. The scope of Equilar's services during fiscal 2018 was limited to providing access to its database to the Compensation Committee and discussing database issues with the Compensation Committee. Equilar did not advise the Compensation Committee on its executive compensation programs or decisions. The Compensation Committee does not otherwise engage any other compensation consultant to advise it on executive compensation matters. 
The Compensation Committee exercises its judgment when reviewing and setting the total mix of compensation related to short- and long-term awards and cash and equity awards rather than relying on a set formula or percentage allocation. The Compensation Committee believes an important part of an executive's value is helping the Company achieve its business objectives when housing market conditions change. Accordingly, when determining the mix of compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the ability of the executive to assist the Company in achieving its business objectives as well as each executive's experience and role at the Company. 
Fiscal 2018 – Outline of Executive Compensation Actions 
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee took actions on matters related to executive compensation as outlined below. These executive compensation components are discussed in more detail under the referenced headings in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section.

Executive Compensation Objectives 
Our primary compensation objectives are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• award compensation that recognizes valuable short and long-term individual performance as well as the Company's overall performance; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders with the goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value.   
[END TABLE]
As a leading national homebuilding company, we employ key executives who have delivered strong results in a competitive and challenging homebuilding market. Our key executives have experience in both up and down cycles in the homebuilding industry. The Compensation Committee considers this type of experience to be very valuable due to the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry. Because of the past performance of our key executives, they may encounter other professional opportunities due to the extensive experience gained during their employment with us. We believe that to maintain our position as a leader in the homebuilding industry and to serve our stockholders' interests, the Company must provide executive compensation programs that continually motivate and are effective in retaining our executives. As a result, we provide competitive compensation packages to retain our executives. 
With the goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value, we believe it is important to have a significant portion of executive compensation tied to attaining both short and long-term performance goals. In addition to the financial performance of the Company, we also consider certain objective and subjective factors when reviewing an executive's value. These factors include the number of years with the Company, significance of job function, ability to analyze and make effective decisions regarding significant business and financial objectives, effectiveness of their work as part of the executive management team and their ability to lead our employees. By placing importance on these qualities, we are aligning individual and corporate performance with the compensation that is ultimately paid for performance. Due to the significant number of years of dedicated service our executives have with us, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee have chosen not to pursue written employment agreements with our executives. Based on the Compensation Committee's continual review of market trends occurring in our industry, we believe our cash and equity compensation programs are effective in allowing us to motivate and retain our executives.  Use of Compensation Peer Group Data 
The Compensation Committee utilizes compensation data from our peer group of publicly-traded homebuilding companies to analyze compensation decisions in light of current market conditions and practices and to ensure that our compensation decisions are reasonable in comparison to our peer group and the value of our executives to the Company. However, the Compensation Committee does not attempt to position compensation at any specified level or ranking within our peer group. In fiscal 2018, the peer group compensation data was compiled by the Compensation Committee Chairman and the Company's Corporate Counsel and Secretary using information from Equilar's database and from the data in executive compensation discussions and tables in publicly filed proxy statements. When determining peer group averages, rankings and medians, we include our Company and each company in our peer group in the rankings and computations. Our peer group may change from year to year based on the discretion of the Compensation Committee or other events such as mergers and acquisitions. Our Compensation Committee considers factors such as market capitalization, competition in our markets and mergers and consolidations when determining our peer group. For fiscal 2018, our peer group consisted of the following publicly-traded homebuilding companies that had market capitalizations ranging from approximately $1.6 billion to $15.1 billion at September 30, 2018. Our market capitalization on that date was $15.9 billion.

Components of Compensation 
Base Salaries – Named Executive Officers 
Base salaries for our executive officers provide a fixed or base level of compensation. When setting base salaries for our executives, we considered the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• level of experience, responsibility and tenure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• national scope of the Company's operations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• contributions to achievements of the Company's operating objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amount of fixed cash compensation considered appropriate to retain the executive's services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• average and median base salaries of comparable executives in our peer group; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommendations of our Chairman and our CEO, other than for themselves.  
[END TABLE]
Base salaries for our named executive officers for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 are set forth in the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name      2017      2018      2019   
 Donald R. Horton      $ 1,000,000      $ 1,000,000      $ 1,000,000   
 David V. Auld      $ 700,000      $ 700,000      $ 700,000   
 Michael J. Murray      $ 500,000      $ 500,000      $ 500,000   
 Bill W. Wheat      $ 500,000      $ 500,000      $ 500,000   
[END TABLE]
 Base salaries for each of our executive officers have remained unchanged for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Base salary levels generally fell at the low end of salaries for comparable positions in our peer group, but we believe that these salaries provide a competitive level of fixed compensation to incent and retain each executive's services. 
When determining named executive officer base salaries, the Compensation Committee did not assign specific weight to the factors listed under the heading "Base Salaries – Named Executive Officers," did not assign a specific ranking that base salaries should be within the peer group and did not use a percentage or ratio that the base salaries should be in relation to total compensation. 
2018 Fiscal Year – Annual Incentive Bonus 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.    During fiscal 2018, in furtherance of our compensation philosophy to award incentive bonuses based on performance, Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray each had the opportunity to earn a performance bonus based on the amount of pre-tax income earned by the Company during the year. 
"Pre-tax income" means consolidated income before income taxes, as publicly reported by the Company in its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
This annual incentive bonus incentivizes Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray to help the Company generate pre-tax income. The pre-tax income performance goal focuses our executives on improving the components of pre-tax income, namely, increasing revenues and controlling our cost of sales and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses. 
The maximum percentage of pre-tax income that could be earned under the annual incentive bonus opportunity for fiscal 2018 was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Fiscal 2018 Performance Goal    1st Semi-Annual  Period    2nd Semi-Annual  Period 
 Donald R. Horton    Pre-Tax Income      0.6%      0.6% 
 David V. Auld    Pre-Tax Income      0.4%      0.4% 
 Michael J. Murray    Pre-Tax Income    0.15%    0.15% 
[END TABLE]
The 1st semi-annual period was the six months ended March 31, 2018 (first and second quarters of fiscal 2018) and the 2nd semi-annual period was the six months ended September 30, 2018 (third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018). The hurdle or threshold for achieving an annual incentive bonus was the attainment of pre-tax income. If no pre-tax income was attained, then no bonus would be paid under the annual incentive bonus opportunity. The bonuses paid under this program are paid in cash. 
At the beginning of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee decided to continue to use 0.6% of pre-tax income for Mr. Horton, 0.4% for Mr. Auld and 0.15% for Mr. Murray as the maximum bonus under this performance goal. The Committee's decision was based on its determination that if the maximum bonus was paid as calculated on estimated projections of the Company's pre-tax income, the amount would be reasonable in relation to the goal achieved and reasonable in relation to the Company's goal of containing overall SG&A expense. 
The percentage chosen for the annual incentive bonus opportunity is not based on any formulaic methodology. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee believed that by using a percentage of pre-tax income, we would incent our Chairman, CEO and COO to achieve higher levels of pre-tax income which aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. By using annual pre-tax income as a performance goal, we balanced the mix of short-term performance period compensation with the long-term performance period compensation of restricted stock units. Because the selection of 0.6%, 0.4% and 0.15% as the maximum percentages was a subjective determination, and not one based on any formulaic method or benchmark other than   as described herein, the Compensation Committee maintained the right to use its discretion to adjust downward the amount to be paid for this award. The Compensation Committee did not use its discretion to adjust the bonus payouts for fiscal 2018. 
2018 Fiscal Year – Annual Incentive Bonus Results and Payout 
The table below sets forth the Company's pre-tax income ("PTI") and the annual incentive bonuses paid in cash for fiscal 2018 to Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray:

 2nd Semi-Annual Period Ended September 30, 2018   $ 1,223,900,232     0.6%   $ 7,343,401     0.4%   $ 4,895,601     0.15%   $ 1,835,850

[END TABLE]
2018 Fiscal Year – Annual Discretionary Bonus 
Chief Financial Officer – Mr. Wheat.    During 2018, the Board of Directors approved discretionary bonuses for Mr. Wheat on a semi-annual basis. For the first semi-annual period ended March 31, 2018, Mr. Wheat received a $500,000 bonus, and for the second semi-annual period ended September 30, 2018, he received a $1,000,000 bonus, for a total bonus of $1,500,000 which was paid in cash. Mr. Wheat's fiscal 2018 discretionary bonus of $1,500,000 was $200,000 more than the bonuses he received in the prior year. 
The increase to Mr. Wheat's bonus was discretionary, but factors considered were the financial and operating performance by the Company in fiscal 2018, which included higher levels of profitability in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and the individual performance of Mr. Wheat in his areas of responsibility. The process of awarding a discretionary bonus to Mr. Wheat included review and consideration by our Chairman and CEO. Our Chairman made a recommendation to the Compensation Committee who then considered the recommendation and made a recommendation to the Board of Directors. The discretionary bonus was not based on specific quantitative formulas, percentages or numerical weightings, but rather was related to subjective evaluations of the Company's level of profitability relative to the prior year, job performance and the level of retention risk related to the Company's ability to continue to employ Mr. Wheat as our CFO. The amount of discretionary bonus awarded to Mr. Wheat was not benchmarked or tied to any other performance metrics or pay of similar executives at peer companies, although the Compensation Committee did review the pay of chief financial officers in our peer group. 
Mr. Wheat's responsibilities within the Company were considered when determining the amount of his discretionary bonus. As Executive Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wheat works closely with our Chairman, CEO and COO in setting operational and financial strategies for our operations, communicating and implementing such strategies across the Company, analyzing and monitoring the Company's performance and reviewing and approving investments in land and lots. These operational strategies include our homebuilding and financial services business plans and incentive compensation, land and lot investment criteria, level of homes in inventory, expense levels, capital structure and liquidity goals, among others. Mr. Wheat also provides executive management direction and oversight to the financial services operations and serves as a director on the boards of the Company's mortgage and insurance subsidiaries.  Mr. Wheat has direct responsibility for the Company's financial management and financial reporting process, including the Company's financial projections and cash forecasts, the effectiveness and integrity of the Company's financial, internal and disclosure controls and procedures, and compliance with all applicable financial reporting rules and regulations for public companies. Mr. Wheat is also directly responsible for providing executive management oversight of the Company's accounting, management reporting, internal audit, finance, treasury, tax, information technology and human resources functions. Additionally, Mr. Wheat is directly involved in the Company's investor relations process, including interactions with investors in the Company's equity and debt securities and industry research analysts. He also assists in the executive management oversight of the Company's public communications, marketing and corporate purchasing functions.

As set forth in the rankings tables above, the target number of 2018 Performance RSUs could have been increased to a maximum of 400,000 for Mr. Horton, 200,000 for Mr. Auld and 60,000 for Mr. Murray upon maximum achievement of each of the four Performance Goals and decreased to a minimum of zero for Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray in the event of below threshold achievement of each of the four Performance Goals. For the 2018 Performance RSUs, the Company's peer group consisted of the following publicly-traded homebuilding companies: Beazer Homes USA, Hovnanian Enterprises, KB Home, Lennar, M.D.C. Holdings, Meritage Homes, NVR, PulteGroup, and Toll Brothers. When the 2018 Performance RSUs were granted, CalAtlantic Group was included in the peer group. When CalAtlantic Group merged into Lennar in February 2018, they were removed from the peer group. Each 2018 Performance RSU represented the contingent right to receive one share of common stock if vesting was satisfied. The 2018 Performance RSUs had no rights to dividends or voting prior to vesting and payout in common stock. 
Vesting of the 2018 Performance RSUs with respect to the TSR Performance Goal was determined after the 2018 Performance Period based on a comparison of the Company's TSR to the S&P 500 Index's TSR as computed by Standard and Poor's using their TSR methodology. Vesting of the 2018 Performance RSUs with respect to the ROI, SG&A and GP Performance Goals was determined after the 2018 Performance Period based on the relative ranking of the Company's performance on each Performance Goal to each peer group company's performance on each Performance Goal.  The hurdle or threshold for earning or vesting in 2018 Performance RSUs with respect to the TSR goal was to perform better than ten percentage points below the S&P 500 Index. The hurdle or threshold for earning or vesting in the 2018 Performance RSUs with respect to the ROI, SG&A and GP Performance Goals was to perform no worse than tenth place because in that event no bonus for that specific goal would be earned. 
The following tables set forth the final peer group rankings based on TSR, ROI, SG&A and GP for the peer group and the Company with respect to the 2018 Performance RSUs:

A normalization adjustment was made to the final peer group rankings to include the results of discontinued operations for one peer group member in calculating ROI, SG&A and GP so that all peer group members and the Company were treated consistently. The normalization adjustment did not change the Company's final ranking on the ROI, SG&A or GP goals. 
After reviewing the above final performance goal rankings for the 2018 Performance RSUs, on November 6, 2018 the Compensation Committee approved the issuance of 212,500, 106,250 and 31,875 shares of common stock to Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray, respectively.  2018 Fiscal Year – Award of 2020 Performance Restricted Stock Units – Potential Vesting at September 30, 2020 and Award of Restricted Stock Units – Time-Based Vesting 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. Under our long-term incentive program, our Chairman, CEO and COO have the opportunity to earn incentive awards based on performance over a period longer than one year. By awarding a portion of compensation over a longer time period, the interests of these executives are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded performance restricted stock units (the "2020 Performance RSUs") to Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Target Number of 2020   Performance RSUs 
 Donald R. Horton    200,000 
 David V. Auld    100,000 
 Michael J. Murray      30,000 
[END TABLE]
The 2020 Performance RSUs, based on four performance goals of relative TSR, relative ROI, relative SG&A and relative GP, will vest, if at all, based on the final performance rankings after the completion of the performance period, which is the three-year period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2020 (the "2020 Performance Period"). The four performance goals and weightings for each award are similar to those set forth on page 29 and are discussed below in the tables and discussion on pages 35, 36 and 37. 
The Compensation Committee chose the relative TSR performance goal because TSR takes into account changes in our stock price plus dividends paid compared to the S&P 500 Index. By comparing our TSR to the S&P 500 Index, we have a goal that incents our executives to achieve a return to our stockholders that is better than the return achieved by a broad-based index of companies. We believe the three performance goals of relative ROI, relative SG&A and relative GP are important internal operating metrics. ROI incents our executives to achieve operating profitability relative to our total assets, which measures our efficiency at using our assets to generate pre-tax income. SG&A incents our executives to control selling, general and administrative expenses. GP incents our executives to maximize our sales prices and control sales incentives and costs of sales, which are composed of the costs of land, labor, materials and products used in building our homes. 
In fiscal 2018, when determining the target number of 2020 Performance RSUs, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's performance and the estimated annual compensation expense for these awards in relation to the Company's estimated annual financial metrics, such as revenue and pre-tax income. The Compensation Committee chose to further incent these executive officers by potentially increasing the target up to the maximum (two times the target amount), as set forth in the tables on pages 35, 36 and 37, in the event that maximum performance is achieved on the four Performance Goals. When the 2020 Performance RSUs were granted, the target and maximum amounts were subjective determinations and not based on any formulaic method or benchmark.  The number of the 2020 Performance RSUs actually settled may be increased or decreased based on relative performance over the 2020 Performance Period as set forth in the following tables.

As set forth in the tables above, the target number of 2020 Performance RSUs may be increased to a maximum of 400,000 for Mr. Horton, 200,000 for Mr. Auld and 60,000 for Mr. Murray upon maximum achievement of each of the four Performance Goals and decreased to a minimum of zero for Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray in the event of below-threshold achievement of each of the four Performance Goals. Performance and percentages that fall between the maximum and the minimum will be ranked using pro-rata linear interpolation between the points set forth in the tables above. For the 2020 Performance RSUs, the Company's peer group consists of the following publicly-traded homebuilding companies: KB Home, Lennar, M.D.C. Holdings, Meritage Homes, NVR, PulteGroup, Taylor Morrison, Toll Brothers and TRI Pointe Group. When the 2020 Performance RSUs were granted, CalAtlantic Group was included in the peer group. When CalAtlantic Group merged into Lennar in February 2018, they were removed from the peer group. Each 2020 Performance RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of common stock if vesting is satisfied. The 2020 Performance RSUs have no rights to dividends or voting. 
Vesting of the 2020 Performance RSUs with respect to the TSR Performance Goal will be determined after the 2020 Performance Period based on a comparison of the Company's TSR to the S&P 500 Index's TSR as computed by Standard and Poor's using their TSR methodology. Vesting of the 2020 Performance RSUs with respect to the ROI, SG&A and GP Performance Goals will be determined after the 2020 Performance Period based on the relative ranking of the Company's performance on each Performance Goal compared to each peer group company's performance on each Performance Goal. Any portion of the Performance RSUs that does not vest due to performance below the threshold will be forfeited.  The hurdle or threshold for earning 2020 Performance RSUs with respect to the TSR goal is to perform better than ten percentage points below the S&P 500 Index. The hurdle or threshold for earning 2020 Performance RSUs with respect to the ROI, SG&A and GP Performance Goals is to perform no worse than tenth place because in that event no bonus for that specific goal would be earned. Additional information on the grant date fair value of the 2020 Performance RSUs is set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 44 and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 46. 
At the time of grant, the Compensation Committee made the subjective determination to set the target and maximum number of 2020 Performance RSUs equal to the 2019 Performance RSUs, based on consideration that if the target or maximum amount were paid and the Company's stock price is at its current level, total compensation to our executive officers would remain within the range of estimated total compensation paid to similar executives in the Company's peer group. However, we cannot guarantee this result as it involves future compensation practices of our peer group. The Compensation Committee further believed in the importance of setting a maximum that is significantly higher than the target to incentivize performance. If the maximum level for the performance goals was achieved, the Company would be in a stronger competitive position than its peers and could create more value for our stockholders. 
Chief Financial Officer. In fiscal 2018, Mr. Wheat was awarded time-vesting RSUs at the same time the Chairman, CEO and COO were awarded Performance RSUs. We believe this type of award incentivizes him appropriately in his role as CFO. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee approved and awarded the 2020 Restricted Stock Units ("2020 Time-Vesting RSUs") to Mr. Wheat as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Number  of 2020 Time-Vesting RSUs 
 Bill W. Wheat    40,000 
[END TABLE]
The 2020 Time-Vesting RSUs vest over a three-year period beginning on November 2, 2017 and ending on November 2, 2020. One-third of the 2020 Time-Vesting RSUs will vest each year on November 2 in 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to continued employment. 
2018 Fiscal Year – Award of Restricted Stock Units – Time-Based Vesting 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Horton and Mr. Auld were awarded 67,500 and 27,000 restricted stock units, respectively, on March 7, 2018 by the Compensation Committee. These restricted stock units vest in equal installments over three years on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment. In determining the number of restricted stock units to award, the Compensation Committee made a subjective determination based on each of the factors listed on page 41 under the heading "2006 Stock Incentive Plan." In addition to those factors, the Compensation Committee also reviewed the Company's stock price, total compensation of the officers, the expected compensation expense related to the grant and the number of restricted stock units and stock options outstanding for both Mr. Horton and Mr. Auld, without giving any formulaic effect to such factors. In addition, the Compensation Committee set the vesting term at three years based on certain factors which included the tenure and role of each executive with the Company, the age of each executive, the retention value and the lack of an employment agreement between each executive and the Company. The terms of the restricted stock unit agreements provide that if the recipient is 65 years old or older and retires from the Company, all unvested restricted stock units become vested. Mr. Horton currently qualifies for such treatment. Additional information on the annual compensation expense and grant date fair value of these restricted stock units is set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 44 and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 46 of this Proxy Statement. 
Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Murray and Mr. Wheat were each awarded 23,000 restricted stock units on March 7, 2018 by the Compensation Committee. These restricted stock units vest in equal installments over five years on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment. In determining the number of restricted stock units to award, the Compensation Committee made a subjective determination based on the factors listed on page 41 under the heading "2006 Stock Incentive Plan." In addition   to those factors, the Compensation Committee also reviewed the Company's stock price, total compensation of the officers, the expected compensation expense related to the grant and the number of restricted stock units and stock options outstanding for both Mr. Murray and Mr. Wheat as a result of the new restricted stock units granted, without giving any formulaic effect to such factors. In addition, the Compensation Committee set the vesting term at five years based on certain factors which include the tenure and role of each executive with the Company, the retention value of restricted stock units based on a five-year vesting schedule and the lack of an employment agreement between each executive and the Company. Additional information on the annual compensation expense and grant date fair value of these restricted stock units is set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 44 and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 46 of this Proxy Statement. 
2019 Fiscal Year – Annual Incentive Bonus 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Compensation Committee has decided to continue the annual incentive bonus opportunity based on the same pre-tax income targets for Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray in fiscal 2019 and the discretionary bonus opportunity for Mr. Wheat. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Fiscal 2018 Performance Goal    Maximum Bonus Potential

 Michael J. Murray        Pre-Tax Income         0.15%       0.15% 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Wheat's annual incentive bonus will be discretionary in nature and based on the performance of his duties described under the heading "2018 Fiscal Year — Annual Discretionary Bonus" beginning on page 28. 
2019 Fiscal Year – Award of 2021 Performance Restricted Stock Units – Potential Vesting at September 30, 2021 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee approved and awarded the 2021 Performance Restricted Stock Units ("2021 Performance RSUs") to Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld, Mr. Murray and Mr. Wheat as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Target Number of 2021 Performance RSUs 
 Donald R. Horton    200,000 
 David V. Auld    100,000 
 Michael J. Murray      30,000 
 Bill W. Wheat      30,000 
[END TABLE]
The 2021 Performance RSUs may vest based on the Company's final performance rankings after the completion of the three-year performance period of October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2021. The 2021 Performance RSUs operate in a similar manner as the 2020 Performance RSUs awarded, as discussed in the section "2018 Fiscal Year — Award of 2020 Performance Restricted Stock Units — Potential Vesting at September 30, 2020 and Award of Restricted Stock Units — Time-Based Vesting" on page 34. 
For Fiscal 2019, it was determined by the Compensation Committee that Mr. Wheat, our CFO, should receive performance RSUs, similar to our Chairman, CEO and COO. In prior years, Mr. Wheat was awarded time-vesting RSUs at the same time as our Chairman, CEO and COO were awarded performance RSUs. 
2019 Fiscal Year – Award of Restricted Stock Units – Time-Based Vesting 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Horton and Mr. Auld were awarded 84,600 and 33,850 restricted stock units, respectively, on November 26, 2018 by the Compensation Committee. These restricted   stock units vest in equal installments over three years from the grant date, subject to continued employment. In determining the number of restricted stock units to award, the Compensation Committee made a subjective determination based on each of the factors listed on page 41 under the heading "2006 Stock Incentive Plan." In addition to those factors, the Compensation Committee also reviewed the Company's stock price, total compensation of the officers, the expected compensation expense related to the grant and the number of restricted stock units and stock options outstanding for both Mr. Horton and Mr. Auld as a result of the new restricted stock units granted, without giving any formulaic effect to such factors. In addition, the Compensation Committee set the vesting term at three years based on certain factors which included the tenure and role of each executive with the Company, the age of each executive, the retention value and the lack of an employment agreement between each executive and the Company. The terms of the restricted stock unit agreements provide that if the recipient is 65 years old or older and retires from the Company, all unvested restricted stock units become vested. Mr. Horton currently qualifies for this treatment. 
Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Murray and Mr. Wheat were each awarded 29,650 restricted stock units on November 26, 2018 by the Compensation Committee. These restricted stock units vest in equal installments over five years from the grant date, subject to continued employment. In determining the number of restricted stock units to award, the Compensation Committee made a subjective determination based on the factors listed on page 41 under the heading "2006 Stock Incentive Plan." In addition to those factors, the Compensation Committee also reviewed the Company's stock price, total compensation of the officers, the expected compensation expense related to the grant and the number of restricted stock units and stock options outstanding for both Mr. Murray and Mr. Wheat, without giving any formulaic effect to such factors. In addition, the Compensation Committee set the vesting term at five years based on certain factors which include the tenure and role of each executive with the Company, the retention value of restricted stock units based on a five-year vesting schedule and the lack of an employment agreement between each executive and the Company. 
Incentive Bonus Plans 
We believe that performance-based bonuses should continue to represent a significant portion of the compensation of our Chairman, CEO and COO. We seek to structure our performance-based awards in a manner that is in line with our operational and financial objectives. The Compensation Committee believes that a balanced executive compensation program is best served by providing compensation plans that allow for balanced short and long-term compensation components, including (i) a short-term or annual bonus performance plan, and (ii) a short-term and long-term equity plan. In furtherance of this objective, the Compensation Committee and our stockholders have previously approved the following incentive plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• D.R. Horton 2018 Incentive Bonus Plan (formerly the "D.R. Horton 2017 Incentive Bonus Plan") – our primary  short-term or annual bonus plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• D.R. Horton 2006 Stock Incentive Plan – our primary short and long-term equity plan.  
[END TABLE]
The 2017 Incentive Bonus Plan was approved by our stockholders most recently on January 24, 2018. The 2018 Incentive Bonus Plan was adopted and approved by our Compensation Committee on November 6, 2018 and replaces the 2017 Incentive Bonus Plan. The amended and restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan was approved by our stockholders most recently on January 22, 2015. The Compensation Committee will continue to evaluate the most effective way to use these two plans. 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.    When reviewing and setting compensation awards for our executives, we have historically considered the tax deductibility of their compensation under Section 162(m) as one of many factors. Section 162(m) generally does not allow a tax deduction to publicly-held companies for compensation over $1 million paid in any fiscal year to the company's named executive officers (other than the chief financial officer). However, for a number of our fiscal years ending on or before September 30, 2018, Section 162(m) exempted qualified performance-based compensation from this $1 million limit if certain requirements were met. Historically, our general intent was for awards issued to covered employees to qualify for the performance-based compensation deduction allowed by Section 162(m).   In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") was enacted into law. The Tax Act eliminates the qualified performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit and subjects the CFO, as well as certain other covered employees, to the $1 million limitation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Tax Act includes a grandfathering provision for compensation paid pursuant to (1) a written binding contract in effect on or before November 2, 2017 that (2) has not been modified in any material way since that date. Based on current guidance, we believe our equity grants awarded on and prior to November 2, 2017, under our amended and restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, and deferred compensation to be paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on or before November 2, 2017 are in compliance with this grandfathering provisions and will remain deductible. Performance based compensation paid pursuant to the 2018 Incentive Bonus Plan and equity grants awarded after November 2, 2017 under our amended and restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan will likely be subject to the limitations on deductibility under Section 162(m) as expanded by the Tax Act. In addition, any future contributions to our deferred compensation plans will likely also be subject to the Section 162(m) limits. 
2018 Incentive Bonus Plan.    The 2018 Incentive Bonus Plan is the primary plan under which our Chairman, CEO and COO are awarded short-term annual incentive cash bonuses. Historically, our intent was for annual bonus awards issued to covered employees to qualify for the performance-based compensation deduction allowed by Section 162(m). Although we still intend to grant performance-based annual compensation opportunities, we no longer expect such amounts to be fully deductible under Section 162(m). 
2006 Stock Incentive Plan.    We use our Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan to issue restricted stock units, stock options and other equity based awards. Since 2015, the Compensation Committee has awarded restricted stock units to the executive officers and key employees on an annual basis. The decision to award restricted stock units was based on the strong employee retention value of restricted stock units and that restricted stock grants result in less dilution to the Company. 
The Compensation Committee will continue to evaluate when to make equity awards to its executives and key employees based on the total compensation of individuals and other factors. Generally, when the Compensation Committee decides to grant equity awards to executive officers, in determining the number and material terms of equity awards to grant the Committee makes a subjective evaluation of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the overall performance of the Company in comparison to its peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an analysis of recent compensation of senior executive officers in the Company's peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommendations of the Chairman, other than for himself;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• contributions the executive officer made and is anticipated to make to the Company's success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• level of experience and responsibility of the executive officer; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• number of equity awards previously granted to executive officers and other employees.  
[END TABLE]
There is no relationship between the timing of the granting of equity-based awards and our release of material non-public information. 
We will continue to evaluate the types of equity awards to be granted to our executives and other employees in the future. Restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and stock appreciation rights are among the types of equity awards that may be considered in the future which may be awarded under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. When considering whether to issue restricted stock (including restricted stock units) or stock options (including stock appreciation rights), the Compensation Committee will review the following factors (in addition to the previously listed factors): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• difference in compensation expense of issuing restricted stock units versus issuing stock options;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• retention achieved by issuing restricted stock units versus issuing stock options; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• value to employee of receiving restricted stock units versus stock options.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options should be available alternatives when considering equity awards. Restricted stock units provide strong retentive value by   providing an award that has immediate value upon vesting and results in lower dilution of our outstanding common shares because fewer shares are issued compared to stock options. Stock options have the potential for strong returns if the stock price increases and the recipient has the ability to defer paying the exercise price and related taxes until the stock options are exercised. 
Retirement Benefits 
Our executive officers do not participate in any qualified defined benefit plans, but they do participate in the retirement plans below. We believe that it is important to offer these retirement plans to our executive officers as part of a competitive long-term compensation program that encourages saving for retirement and that promotes long-term retention. 
Profit Sharing Plus Plan ("401(k) plan").    Our executive officers participate in our Company-wide 401(k) plan. Under this plan, executive officers, like all other eligible employees, may contribute 1% to 75% of their earnings, on a pre-tax basis, into the 401(k) plan. For 2018, the maximum amount that could be contributed was $18,500 ($24,500 for participants 50 years or older). The Company makes a matching contribution to the participant's account in an amount of $0.50 for each $1.00 contributed by the participant up to 6% of his or her salary. The matching contributions made by the Company on behalf of the executive officers are included in the "All Other Compensation" column in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 44. 
Deferred Compensation Plan.    The Company established the Deferred Compensation Plan effective as of June 15, 2002 and amended and restated it on December 10, 2008 (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). The Deferred Compensation Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of "management or highly compensated employees" as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, was adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee and ratified by the Board of Directors. 
SERP 2.    The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 2 ("SERP 2"), as amended and restated December 10, 2008, a nonqualified plan, was originally adopted by the Company in 1994 to permit eligible participants, which include our executive officers, region presidents, division presidents and other key employees, to accrue supplemental Company benefits payable upon retirement, separation of service, death or disability. The SERP 2 provides that if the executive is employed by the Company on the last day of the fiscal year, the Company will establish a liability to such executive equal to 10% of his or her annual base salary as of the first day of such fiscal year. This liability will accrue earnings in future years at a rate established by the administrative committee for the SERP 2. Amounts payable under the SERP 2 are not secured or held in trust and the plan participants' rights to enforce payment are the same as a general unsecured creditor. 
In connection with our risk oversight related to the retention and compensation of our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee has determined that an appropriate compensation package should include a reasonable amount of fixed compensation for both short and longer term compensation. In this regard, in fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the amounts listed in the column titled "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings" in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 44. For the Company, these amounts represent the above-market portion of earnings on outstanding SERP 2 balances for the named executive officers. As part of this analysis, we reviewed the data related to the dollar amounts disclosed in the same column titled "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings" in the Summary Compensation Tables for each of the CEOs or principal executive officers of each company in our peer group from their most recently filed proxy statements. The dollar amounts listed under this heading ranged from zero to $428,586. For fiscal 2018, the amount for our Chairman was $266,647 and the amount for our CEO was $121,815. We believe the amounts accrued for above-market earnings on SERP 2 balances are reasonable when compared to our peer group and reasonable when considered in relation to the total compensation packages offered to our named executive officers. Also, we considered other factors such as the Company does not provide our named executive officers with employment agreements or severance agreements or other forms of guaranteed retirement benefits other than the 401(k) matching contribution discussed above. As a result, our SERP 2   program continues to serve as a useful and reasonable fixed compensation component of our overall compensation package.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans 
D.R. Horton has established the following nonqualified deferred compensation plans: 
Deferred Compensation Plan.    The Deferred Compensation Plan permits participants, including D.R. Horton's executive officers and directors, to voluntarily defer receipt of up to 100% of bonus or director fee compensation from D.R. Horton and up to 90% of base salary from D.R. Horton. The participants earn a rate of return on their deferred amounts based on their selection from a variety of independently managed funds. The Company does not provide a guaranteed rate of return on these deferred amounts. The rate of return realized depends on the participant's fund selections and market performance of these funds. Upon his or her annual election, a participant's Deferred Compensation Plan benefit will be paid, or commence to be paid, upon separation from service or on a fixed date. Specified employees, as defined in Code Section 409A, generally   cannot be paid until six months after separation from service (or, if earlier, upon a change in control). Payment may also be made upon death, disability or an unforeseeable emergency. Payments are made in a lump sum unless installments are elected. Amounts payable under the plan are not secured or held in trust, and the plan participants' rights to enforce payment are the same as a general unsecured creditor. However, upon a change in control (as defined in the Deferred Compensation Plan), all plan benefits will be fully funded through an irrevocable grantor trust (also known as a "Rabbi trust"). The participants, at their election, may choose to have the deferred amounts paid out through scheduled in-service distributions (in a lump sum or annual installments of between two and five years) or following the later of termination of employment, director service or attaining the age of 62. The Deferred Compensation Plan was adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee and ratified by the Board of Directors. 
SERP 2.    Unlike the Deferred Compensation Plan, these are not elective deferrals, but rather the Company credits an amount to each participant's account. Participation in the SERP 2 is considered by the Compensation Committee annually at the beginning of the fiscal year. Pursuant to the SERP 2, if the executive is employed by the Company on the last day of a fiscal year, then the Company will establish a liability to such executive equal to 10% of his or her annual base salary as of the first day of such fiscal year. This liability will accrue earnings in future years at a rate established by the administrative committee for the SERP 2. Amounts payable under the SERP 2 are not secured or held in trust, and the plan participants' rights to enforce payment are the same as a general unsecured creditor. Amounts deferred under the SERP 2 are payable within 60 days following the retirement or termination of employment of the participant, the death or disability of the participant or a change in control of the Company. Provided however, specified employees, as defined in Code Section 409A, generally cannot be paid until six months after separation from service (or, if earlier, upon a change in control). The definition of change in control is described in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 50. The form of distribution may be in a lump sum, or in quarterly installments over a period not to exceed five years, as elected by the participant. 
The following table shows, for each named executive officer, aggregate contributions, earnings and withdrawals/distributions during fiscal 2018 and outstanding balances as of September 30, 2018 under all of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
None of our named executive officers has employment or change in control agreements with us specifically providing for payments upon involuntary termination of their employment. However, certain of our benefit and incentive plans contain various provisions regarding termination of employment or change in control. Any additional severance payments would be at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and determined at the time of termination. The following is a summary of the treatment of benefits under our benefit plans for various types of terminations, including upon a change in control. 
Generally, our benefit plans define "cause" as a violation of the standards of employee conduct set forth in our employee manual and "change in control" as the occurrence of any of the following events: 
(i) Our merger, consolidation or reorganization into another entity if our stockholders immediately before such transaction do not, immediately after such transaction, own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities resulting from such transaction and in substantially the same proportion as their stock ownership prior to the transaction; 
(ii) We sell all or substantially all of our assets to another entity or we completely liquidate or dissolve; 
(iii) A person (as defined by Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities (the threshold for amounts deposited under our SERP 2 plan on or after January 1, 2005 is 50% or 35% acquired in a single transaction or series of transactions in any 12-month period); and 
(iv) During any two-year period, a majority of the members of the Board serving at the date of the most recent approval of our benefit plan by stockholders is replaced by members of the Board who are not nominated and approved by the Board. 
For purposes of calculating beneficial ownership pursuant to this paragraph, no voting securities held by our Chairman, Donald R. Horton, as of the date of the adoption of the plan in question or received in any merger transaction shall be included in the calculation. 
2006 Stock Incentive Plan 
Our D.R. Horton 2006 Stock Incentive Plan allows or provides for accelerated vesting of all outstanding unvested restricted stock units and options granted under the plan in the event of a change in control of the Company or in the event of a participant's death, disability or retirement at the retirement age specified in the plan and the participant or his or her beneficiary, as applicable, will be entitled to exercise such options for a period of one year in the event of retirement or two years in the event of death or disability. In the event the participant's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the participant voluntarily, the participant will be entitled to exercise any options vested as of the date of termination for a period of three months following such termination. If the participant is terminated by the Company for cause, all options will immediately terminate and the participant will forfeit all vested options.  Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan No. 2 (SERP 2) 
Under the SERP 2, all amounts deferred shall be paid (either in lump sum or in quarterly installments as elected by the participant) within 60 days following the date of the participant's retirement or termination of employment, disability, death or change in control of the Company; provided, however, "specified employees," as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, must wait six months following termination of employment before payments accrued on or after January 1, 2005 can be made. In the event the Company terminates a participant for cause, all benefits under the SERP 2 will be forfeited and no payments will be made to the participant. In the event of a change in control, all amounts deferred shall be paid (in accordance with the participant's election) within 60 days following the date of the change in control. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant's election as to form of payment (lump sum or installment) must have been made at least 12 months prior to distribution. If a termination event occurs and no election has been made, the distributions of pre-2005 accruals will be made on the first day of the 13th month following the date of election, and the distribution of post-2004 accruals will be made in a lump sum upon termination of employment (or six months later for specified employees). 
Table – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table reflects amounts of compensation to be paid to each of the named executive officers in the event of termination of employment or change in control. Because neither the Company nor any of its plans provides for additional benefits related to a change in control termination, if such a termination is triggered, the payments would be as set forth under the applicable column under Termination of Employment. 
The amounts in the table assume a termination date of September 30, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year, and, if applicable, are based on the closing price of our common stock of $42.18 on September 28, 2018. Because only Mr. Horton had reached the normal retirement age (65 years old) on September 30, 2018, we only included amounts payable upon retirement for him. These amounts are estimates of payments to executives upon termination of employment or a change in control. Actual amounts can only be determined at the time of such executive's actual separation from the Company or change in control. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the company's stock price and the executive's age. Amounts to be provided to an executive under arrangements that do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of our executive officers and are available to all salaried employees are not included in the following table in accordance with SEC regulations. 
In addition to the amounts set forth below, each of the named executive officers would be entitled to receive, upon certain termination events or a change in control, a distribution of his or her outstanding balance of compensation earned in prior years and deferred, at the executive officer's option, under our Deferred Compensation Plan. The balances of such accounts are set forth and explained in the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table on page 49.  The table reflects compensation to be paid based on the listed events if such events occurred on September 30, 2018.

(1)  Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray were awarded a target number of 200,000, 100,000 and 30,000 2019 Performance RSUs,  respectively, for the performance period of October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2019. Pro-rata vesting may occur based on the number of months served from October 1, 2016 in the event of  voluntary termination, normal retirement or without cause termination after completion of the performance period. With respect to death or disability, the 2019 Performance RSUs vest pro-rata based on time  passed. Upon a change in control, the Committee may accelerate vesting of part or all of the 2019 Performance RSUs. With respect to an event of voluntary termination, normal retirement, without cause termination, death, disability or a change in  control, the 2019 Performance RSUs are valued at $42.18 per unit, the closing price of our stock on September 28, 2018. The value in the table reflects pro-rata vesting (two of three years completed)  based on time passed as if an event of voluntary termination, normal retirement, without cause termination, death, disability or a change in control had occurred on September 30, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray were awarded a target number of 200,000, 100,000 and 30,000 2020 Performance RSUs,  respectively, for the performance period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2020. Pro-rata vesting may occur based on the number of months served from October 1, 2017 in the event of  voluntary termination, normal retirement or without cause termination after completion of the performance period. With respect to death or disability, the 2020 Performance RSUs vest pro-rata based on time  passed. Upon a change in control, the Committee may accelerate vesting of part or all of the 2020 Performance RSUs. With respect to an event of voluntary termination, normal retirement, without cause termination, death, disability or a change in  control, the 2020 Performance RSUs are valued at $42.18 per unit, the closing price of our stock on September 28, 2018. The value in the table reflects pro-rata vesting (one of three years completed)  based on time passed as if an event of voluntary termination, normal retirement, without cause termination, death, disability or a change in control had occurred on September 30, 2018. The 2020 Performance RSUs are discussed in more detail  under the heading "2018 Fiscal Year – Award of 2020 Performance Restricted Stock Units – Potential Vesting at September 30, 2020 and  Award of Restricted Stock Units – Time-Based Vesting" on page 34.

(3)  For Mr. Horton, Mr. Auld and Mr. Murray, the time-vesting RSU amounts represent each officer's unvested portion of RSUs,  as shown in the "Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested" column of the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table on page 47, valued at $42.18 per  unit, the closing price of our stock on September 28, 2018. The value in the table reflects accelerated vesting if an event of voluntary termination, normal retirement, termination without cause, death or disability, or change in control had  occurred on September 30, 2018. For Mr. Wheat, the time-vesting RSU amounts under voluntary and termination without cause represent the amount of accelerated vesting based on a pro-rata portion of  his November 2, 2017, November 2, 2016 and November 4, 2015 grants, valued at $42.18 per unit, the closing price of our stock on September 28, 2018. The time-vesting RSU amounts under death, disability or a change of control  represents his unvested portion of RSUs as shown in the "Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested" column of the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End"  table on page 47, valued at $42.18 per unit, the closing price of our stock on September 28, 2018. Additional information on the time-vesting RSUs granted in fiscal 2018 is set forth in footnote 3 to the "Grants of Plan-Based  Awards" table on page 46.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Because only one of our named executive officers has reached the normal retirement age (65 years old) under our applicable plans on  September 30, 2018, we only included amounts under the "Normal Retirement" column for that one officer.  
[END TABLE]
 CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee and the total annual compensation of Mr. Auld, our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
To identify the median compensated employee, we used the following methodology: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We used September 30, 2018 as the date to determine the median employee. At that date, we had approximately 8,400 employees consisting of  full-time, part-time and temporary employees. Other than our CEO, all employees as of such date were included in our population.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the median employee from our employee population, we obtained a listing of total compensation paid to each employee during fiscal 2018. For  this purpose, total compensation included salary or wages, as applicable, commissions, bonuses, equity awards that vested or were exercised during the year, and any other cash compensation. Such amounts were obtained from our payroll records. We  annualized the salaries and wages of our full and part-time employees who were not employed for the entire fiscal year. The above-described compensation measure was consistently applied to all employees.  
[END TABLE]
Once we identified our median employee, we calculated the employee's total annual compensation using the same methodology used to calculate the total compensation of our CEO in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 46. In addition to the amounts required to be reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table, we included the dollar value of employer paid non-discriminatory health insurance benefits in the total annual compensation of our median employee and of our CEO to better reflect our employee compensation practices. 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The total compensation of our median employee was $92,304.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The total compensation of our CEO was $14,886,528.  
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, for fiscal 2018, the ratio of the total compensation of Mr. Auld, our CEO, to the total compensation of the median compensated of all employees (excluding Mr. Auld), was 161 to 1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, our pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratio disclosures reported by other companies.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
We have a written Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It requires that all directors and employees are expected to avoid relationships that present a potential or actual conflict between his or her personal interest and the interest of the Company. We generally review related-party transactions regarding our directors and executive officers in a similar manner as we review relationships that may give rise to a conflict of interest, provided there may be certain related-party transactions that may be approved, ratified, or in compliance with Company programs we make available to our directors, officers and employees. Generally, a "conflict of interest" exists whenever an individual's personal or private interests interfere or conflict with the interests of the Company. A conflict situation can arise when a director or employee takes action or has personal interests that may make it difficult to perform Company work or make Company decisions objectively or effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when a director or employee, or member of his or her immediate family receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Company, whether received from the Company or a third party. 
To avoid conflicts of interest, or improper related-party transactions, each director or executive officer must disclose to the Company's Chief Legal Officer or Corporate Compliance Officer any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest or related-party transaction. The Chief Legal Officer or Corporate Compliance Officer then reviews the transaction, and if necessary, reports the transaction to a committee of the Board of Directors composed of independent directors. Related-party transactions that comply with Company programs or are determined to be on similar terms as transactions of the same nature with unrelated parties and, that in either case, do not present an improper conflict of interest, do not require independent committee approval or ratification, provided the transaction is reviewed by our Chief Legal Officer or Corporate Compliance Officer and one of them determined the transaction to be in compliance. 
John Auld, the adult son of David Auld, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, is employed by the Company at the Orlando Division. In fiscal 2018, John Auld earned cash compensation of $192,500 and equity compensation valued at $62,625. His compensation is consistent with the compensation provided to other employees of the same level with similar responsibilities. 
In December 2016, Michael Murray, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, entered into a contract with the Company to build a home for his personal residence on a lot owned by him. The sales price is expected to be approximately $3,100,000, which will be due from Mr. Murray to the Company at completion. The home is currently under construction and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2019. This transaction was reviewed by the Corporate Compliance Officer and determined to be in compliance with the Company's program that is available to all employees and directors. 
The following related party transactions were each reviewed by the Corporate Compliance Officer and determined to be on similar terms as transactions of the same nature with unrelated parties. These transactions were also approved by the Nominating and Governance Committee prior to entering into the contracts. 
During fiscal 2017 and 2018, the Company entered into contracts to purchase acreage from entities owned by Ryan Horton and Reagan Horton, the adult sons of Donald Horton, the Company's Chairman. The contract amounts and the fiscal 2018 purchase transactions are summarized below.

[END TABLE]
Additionally, in July 2018, the Company purchased 233 head of cattle from Ryan and Reagan Horton for $279,600. The cattle are to be raised at a ranch owned by the Company.  Since the beginning of our fiscal year, the Company entered into contracts to purchase lots from entities in which Andrew Auld, the adult son of David Auld, is a principal. The contract amounts and the fiscal 2018 purchase transactions are summarized below.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, D.R. Horton's Compensation Committee was composed of Barbara K. Allen, Brad S. Anderson, Michael R. Buchanan and Michael W. Hewatt, with Mr. Anderson serving as its Chairman. None of the members of the Compensation Committee has served the Company in any capacity other than as a member of our board or a member of a committee thereof. In addition, none of our executive officers served as a director of any other entity one of whose executive officers served as a director of D.R. Horton.  PROPOSAL TWO 
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, our stockholders are being asked to approve a non-binding advisory resolution on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Although this "say-on-pay" resolution is non-binding, our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee welcome your opinion and will consider the result of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 24, 2018, our stockholders voted in favor of a resolution to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables, notes and narrative in our Proxy Statement for the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Approximately 95.50% of votes cast voted in favor of the advisory resolution on executive compensation. 
At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 24, 2018, our stockholders elected to have an advisory vote on executive compensation every year. At this time, our Board has determined to continue to hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation and thus, we currently anticipate our next advisory vote on executive compensation after our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
We encourage you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 22 of this Proxy Statement, which describes in detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables, notes and narrative, appearing on pages 44 through 53, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
We believe that our current executive compensation program achieves an appropriate balance of short-term and long-term compensation incentives, reinforces the link between executive pay and the Company's long-term performance and stock value, and thereby aligns the interests of our named executive officers with those of stockholders. 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and as a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc. (the "Company") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables, notes and narrative in the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that Stockholders Vote "FOR" 
Approval of the Advisory Resolution on Executive Compensation.  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
Ernst & Young LLP has been engaged by the Audit Committee to serve through our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.

Change in Independent Registered Public Accountants 
Dismissal of previous independent registered public accounting firm: 
On December 7, 2018, the Audit Committee dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
The reports of PwC on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 and the subsequent period through December 7, 2018, (i) there were no "disagreements" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, any of which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports on the consolidated financial statements for such fiscal years; and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
Engagement of new independent registered public accounting firm: 
On December 7, 2018, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. The decision to change the Company's principal independent accountants was the result of a competitive request for proposal process undertaken by the Audit Committee. 
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 and through the appointment of EY on December 7, 2018, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with EY regarding: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be  rendered on the Company's financial statements, nor did EY provide a written report or oral advice to the Company that EY concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or  financial reporting issue; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related  instructions), or a "reportable event" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).  
[END TABLE]
Letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP: 
The Company provided PwC with a copy of a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Form 8-K"), which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on December 13, 2018, and requested that PwC furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether PwC agreed with the disclosures in the Form 8-K or, if not, stating the respects in which it did not agree. The Company received the requested letter from PwC and a copy of the letter, dated December 13, 2018, was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Form 8-K and such letter is incorporated by reference herein. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services 
The Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation for and overseeing the work of the independent auditor. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. 
In connection with the engagement of the independent auditor for fiscal 2019, the Audit Committee pre-approved the services listed below by category of service, including the pre-approval of fee limits. The Audit Committee's pre-approval process by category of service also includes a review of specific services to be performed and fees expected to be incurred within each category of service. The term of any pre-approval is 12 months from the date of the pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. During fiscal 2019, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires separate pre-approval before engaging the independent auditor. 
The services pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which may be performed by the independent auditor during fiscal 2019, include the following: 
Audit Services include audit work performed related to the Company's financial statements (including quarterly reviews), as well as work that generally only the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters, statutory audits, and attest services and consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting standards. 
Audit-Related Services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements. 
Tax Services include all services performed by the independent auditor's tax personnel except those services specifically related to the audit of the financial statements, and include fees in the areas of tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice. 
All Other Fees are those associated with permitted services not included in the other categories. 
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee may not otherwise delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.  Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management D.R. Horton's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Further, the Audit Committee has discussed with D.R. Horton's independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including D.R. Horton's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the auditor's responsibility under generally accepted auditing standards, significant accounting policies, management's judgments and accounting estimates, any audit adjustments, other information in documents containing audited financial statements and other matters. Finally, the Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed the auditor's independence with the auditor. 
Based on its review and discussion described above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 be included in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Further, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP as D.R. Horton's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.

 PROPOSAL THREE 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. During fiscal 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm and also provided certain other audit-related services, as further discussed above under the heading "Audit Fees and All Other Fees" on page 58. A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if he or she desires, make a statement. 
Although we are not required to do so, we are seeking stockholder ratification of Ernst & Young LLP's appointment as our independent registered public accounting firm. If Ernst & Young LLP's appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain Ernst & Young LLP, but still may retain them. Even if the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our and our stockholders' best interests. 
Vote Required 
Approval of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of common stock present or represented, and entitled to vote thereon, at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
The Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that Stockholders Vote "FOR" the Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm for our Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 2019.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires D.R. Horton's directors, certain of its officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of D.R. Horton's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Such officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish D.R. Horton with copies of all forms they file pursuant to Section 16(a). Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it and on written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5 reports were required for those persons, D.R. Horton believes that all filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with during the year ended September 30, 2018 on a timely basis. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
Any stockholder who intends to present a proposal for action at D.R. Horton's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and to have D.R. Horton include such proposal in its proxy soliciting materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must deliver a copy of the proposal to the Corporate Secretary of D.R. Horton at 1341 Horton Circle, Arlington, Texas 76011 not later than the close of business on August 16, 2019. Further, all proposals submitted for inclusion in D.R. Horton's proxy soliciting materials relating to the 2020 Annual Meeting must comply with all of the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. 
In addition, apart from the Rule 14a-8 process and director nominations made pursuant to the proxy access process, the Bylaws of D.R. Horton provide that any stockholder intending to propose any business at our 2020 Annual Meeting must submit written notice of that proposal in a timely manner to Corporate Secretary of D.R. Horton for such proposal to be acted upon at the meeting of stockholders. To be timely, a stockholder's notice for our 2020 Annual Meeting must be delivered to the principal executive offices of D.R. Horton not later than the close of business on October 25, 2019 and not earlier than the close of business on September 25, 2019. In the event that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is changed by more than 30 calendar days from the anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to such meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th calendar day prior to such meeting or the 10th calendar day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is made. In no event shall public disclosure of an adjournment, recess or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. The notice must include the information specified in our Bylaws, including information concerning the nominee or the proposal, and the stockholder and the beneficial owner, as the case may be. We will not entertain any such proposals at the annual meeting that do not meet the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. 
Pursuant to the proxy access provision in our Bylaws, in order for a stockholder or group of stockholders to nominate a director candidate to be included in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting, proper written notice of the nomination must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary of D.R. Horton not later than the close of business on August 16, 2019 and not earlier than the close of business on July 17, 2019, and the nomination must otherwise comply with our Bylaws. In the event that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is changed by more than 30 calendar days from the anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder(s) to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 150th calendar day prior to such meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th calendar day prior to such meeting or the 10th calendar day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is made.
