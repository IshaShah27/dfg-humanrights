PROXY STATEMENT
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board," the members of which are referred to as "Trustees") of the Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund Ltd., a Delaware statutory trust (the "Fund"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Fund to be held on Monday, May 13, 2019, at 9:15 a.m., local time, at The Cole Auditorium, The Greenwich Library, 101 West Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830 (the "Meeting"), and at any adjournments or postponements thereof.

In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, officers of the Fund and officers and regular employees of American Stock Transfer & Trust Company ("AST"), the Fund's transfer agent, and affiliates of AST or other representatives of the Fund may also solicit proxies by telephone, Internet, or in person. In addition, the Fund has retained Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $1,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. The Fund will pay the costs of the proxy solicitation and the expenses incurred in connection with preparing, printing, and mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and/or Proxy Statement and its enclosures. If requested, the Fund will also reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of its shares.
The Fund's most recent annual report, including audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, is available upon request, without charge, by writing to the Secretary of the Fund, One Corporate Center, Rye, New York 10580-1422, calling the Fund at 800-422-3554, or via the Internet at www.gabelli.com.
If the proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees as Trustees as described in this Proxy Statement, unless instructions to the contrary are marked thereon, and at the discretion of the proxy holders as to the transaction of any other business that may properly come before the Meeting. Any shareholder who has submitted a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise either by attending the Meeting and voting his or her shares in person or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later dated proxy to the Fund at the above address prior to the date of the Meeting.
A "quorum" is required in order to transact business at the Meeting. A quorum of shareholders is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of one-third of the outstanding shares of the Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting. In the event a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or in the event that a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve any of the proposed items are not received, the chairperson of the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of such Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. If a quorum is present, a shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received for approval and it is otherwise appropriate. If a quorum is present, the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies which they are entitled to vote "FOR" any proposal in favor of such adjournment and will vote those proxies required to be voted "AGAINST" any proposal against any such adjournment. Absent the establishment of a subsequent record date and the giving of notice to the holders of record thereon, the adjourned meeting must take place not more than 130 days after the record date. At such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original Meeting. The Fund may postpone or cancel a meeting of shareholders, and if it does the Fund will make a public announcement of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting. The postponed meeting may not be held more than 130 days after the initial record date.
The close of business on March 21, 2019, has been fixed as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and all adjournments or postponements thereof.
The Fund has two classes of shares of beneficial interest outstanding: common shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Shares"), and 5.25% Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares, par value $0.01 per share ("Preferred Shares").

SUMMARY OF VOTING RIGHTS ON PROXY PROPOSALS
PROPOSAL: TO ELECT THREE (3) TRUSTEES OF THE FUND
Nominees for the Board of Trustees
The Board consists of eleven Trustees, nine of whom are not "interested persons" of the Fund (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")). The Fund divides the Board into three classes, each class having a term of three years. Each year, the term of office of one class will expire. James A. Dinsmore, Elizabeth C. Bogan, and Anthonie C. van Ekris have each been nominated by the Board for election to serve for a three year term to expire at the Fund's 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Dr. Bogan has served as a Trustee of the Fund since 1986, Mr. Platt has served as a Trustee since 1997, Mr. Harding has served as a Trustee since 2007, and Mr. Bizzell has served as a Trustee since 2008. Messrs. Conn, Dinsmore, Fahrenkopf, Gabelli, Melarkey, Nakamura, and van Ekris became Trustees of the Fund on November 1, 2015. All of the Trustees, with the exception of Mr. Dinsmore, are also directors or trustees of other investment companies for which Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") or its affiliates serve as investment adviser. The classes of Trustees are indicated below:
Nominees to Serve Until 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
James A. Dinsmore
Elizabeth C. Bogan
Anthonie C. van Ekris
Trustees Serving Until 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
Mario J. Gabelli
Daniel D. Harding
Kuni Nakamura
Nicolas W. Platt
Trustees Serving Until 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
Kinchen C. Bizzell
James P. Conn
Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr.
Michael J. Melarkey
Under the Fund's Declaration of Trust, Statement of Preferences, and the 1940 Act, holders of the Fund's outstanding Preferred Shares, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two Trustees, and holders of the Fund's outstanding Common Shares and Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, are entitled to elect the remaining Trustees. The holders of the Fund's outstanding Preferred Shares would be entitled to elect the minimum number of additional Trustees that would represent a majority of the Trustees in the event that dividends on the Fund's Preferred Shares become in arrears for two full years and until all arrearages are eliminated. No dividend arrearages exist as of the date of this Proxy Statement. Messrs. Melarkey and Nakamura are currently the Trustees elected solely by the holders of the Fund's Preferred Shares, and their terms as Trustees are scheduled to expire at the Fund's 2020 and 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, respectively. Therefore, they are not standing for election at this Meeting.
Unless instructions are provided to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote the proxy "FOR" the election of the nominees named above. Each nominee has indicated that he has consented to serve as a Trustee if elected at the Meeting. If, however, a designated nominee declines or otherwise becomes unavailable for election, the proxy confers discretionary power on the persons named therein to vote in favor of a substitute nominee or nominees. Each nominee is qualified to serve as a Trustee under the Fund's governing documents.
Information about Trustees and Officers
Set forth in the table below are the existing Trustees, including those Trustees who are not considered to be "interested persons," as defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent Trustees"), three of whom are nominated for re-election to the Board of the Fund, and officers of the Fund, including information relating to their respective positions held with the Fund, a brief statement of their principal occupations, and, in the case of the Trustees, their other directorships during the past five years (excluding other funds managed by the Adviser), if any.

The Board believes that each Trustee's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of other Trustees lead to the conclusion that each Trustee should serve in such capacity. Among the attributes or skills common to all Trustees are their ability to review critically and to evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other Trustees, the Adviser, the sub-administrator, other service providers, counsel, and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective and independent business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. Each Trustee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively has been attained in large part through the Trustee's business, consulting, or public service positions and through experience from service as a member of the Board and one or more of the other funds in the Fund Complex, public companies, non-profit entities, or other organizations as set forth above and below. Each Trustee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively also has been enhanced by education, professional training, and other experience.

Trustees â Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities
Overall responsibility for general oversight of the Fund rests with the Board. Mr. Gabelli, an Interested Trustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board has appointed Mr. Conn as the Lead Independent Trustee. The Lead Independent Trustee presides over executive sessions of the Trustees and also serves between meetings of the Board as a liaison with service providers, officers, counsel, and other Trustees on a wide variety of matters including scheduling agenda items for Board meetings. Designation as such does not impose on the Lead Independent Trustee any obligations or standards greater than or different from other Trustees. The Board has established a Nominating Committee and an Audit Committee to assist the Board in the oversight of the management and affairs of the Fund. The Board also has an ad hoc Proxy Voting Committee that exercises beneficial ownership responsibilities on behalf of the Fund in selected situations. From time to time, the Board establishes additional committees or informal working groups, such as an ad hoc Pricing Committee related to securities offerings by the Fund, to address specific matters, or assigns one of its members to work with trustees or directors of other funds in the Fund Complex on special committees or working groups that address fund complex-wide matters, such as the multi-fund ad hoc Compensation Committee relating to the compensation of the Chief Compliance Officer for all the funds in the Fund Complex, and a separate multi-fund ad hoc Compensation Committee relating to the compensation of certain other officers of the closed-end funds in the Fund Complex.
All of the Fund's Trustees, other than Messrs. Mario J. Gabelli and James A. Dinsmore, are Independent Trustees and the Board believes it is able to provide effective oversight of the Fund's service providers. In addition to providing feedback and direction during Board meetings, the Independent Trustees meet regularly in executive session and chair all committees of the Board.
The Fund's operations entail a variety of risks, including investment, administration, valuation, and a range of compliance matters. Although the Adviser, the sub-administrator, and the officers of the Fund are responsible for managing these risks on a dayto day basis within the framework of their established risk management functions, the Board also addresses risk management of the Fund through its meetings and those of the committees and working groups. As part of its general oversight, the Board reviews with the Adviser at Board meetings the levels and types of risks being undertaken by the Fund, and the Audit Committee discusses the Fund's risk management and controls with the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by the Fund. The Board reviews valuation policies and procedures and the valuations of specific illiquid securities. The Board also receives periodic reports from the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer regarding compliance matters relating to the Fund and its major service providers, including results of the implementation and testing of the Fund's and such providers' compliance programs. The Board's oversight function is facilitated by management reporting processes designed to provide visibility to the Board regarding the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks, and the controls and policies and procedures used to mitigate those risks. The Board reviews its role in supervising the Fund's risk management from time to time and may make changes at its discretion at any time.
The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate for the Fund because it enables the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over matters under its purview, allocates responsibility among committees in a manner that fosters effective oversight, and allows the Board to devote appropriate resources to specific issues in a flexible manner as they arise. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure as well as its overall structure, composition, and functioning, and may make changes at its discretion at any time.

All shares were valued as of December 31, 2018.
Set forth in the table below is the amount of shares beneficially owned by each Trustee, nominee for election as Trustee, and executive officer of the Fund.
Set forth in the table below is the amount of interests beneficially owned by each Independent Trustee, nominee for election as an Independent Trustee or his or her immediate family member, as applicable, in a person, other than a registered investment company, that may be deemed to be controlled by the Fund's Adviser and/or affiliates (including Mario J. Gabelli) and in that event would be deemed to be under common control with the Fund's Adviser.
The Fund pays each Independent Trustee an annual retainer of $8,500 plus $1,000 for each Board meeting attended. Each Independent Trustee is reimbursed by the Fund for any outofpocket expenses incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members receive $500 per meeting attended. In addition, the Audit Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $2,000, the Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $2,000, and the Lead Independent Trustee receives an annual fee of $1,000. A Trustee may receive a single meeting fee, allocated among the participating funds, for participation in certain meetings on behalf of multiple funds. The aggregate remuneration (excluding outofpocket expenses) paid by the Fund to such Trustees during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, amounted to $126,500. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Trustees of the Fund met four times, all of which were regular quarterly Board meetings. Each Trustee then serving in such capacity attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and of any committee of which he is a member.
The Audit Committee and Audit Committee Report
The role of the Fund's Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Trustees in its oversight of (i) the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statement reporting process and the independent audit and reviews thereof; (ii) the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls, and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain of its service providers; (iii) the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and (iv) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence, and performance. The Audit Committee also is required to prepare an audit committee report pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for inclusion in the Fund's annual proxy statement. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter (the "Audit Charter") that was most recently reviewed and approved by the Board of Trustees on November 15, 2018. The Audit Charter is available in the Closed-End Funds â Corporate Governance Section on the Fund's website at www.gabelli.com.
Pursuant to the Audit Charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for conferring with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing annual financial statements, approving the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and overseeing the Fund's internal controls. The Audit Charter also contains provisions relating to the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services to be provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers"), the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, to the Fund and to the Adviser and certain of its affiliates. The Audit Committee advises the full Board with respect to accounting, auditing, and financial matters affecting the Fund. As set forth in the Audit Charter, management is responsible for maintaining appropriate systems for accounting and internal control, and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Board of Trustees and to the Audit Committee, as representatives of shareholders. The independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund reports directly to the Audit Committee.
In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on November 13, 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management of the Fund and PricewaterhouseCoopers the audited financial statements of the Fund as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and the conduct of the audit of such financial statements.
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the accounting principles applied by the Fund and such other matters brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by PricewaterhouseCoopers as required by current standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee also received from PricewaterhouseCoopers the written disclosures and statements required by the SEC's independence rules, delineating relationships between PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Fund, and discussed the impact that any such relationships might have on the objectivity and independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the independent registered public accounting firm.
As set forth above, and as more fully set forth in the Audit Charter, the Audit Committee has significant duties and powers in its oversight role with respect to the Fund's financial reporting procedures, internal control systems, and the independent audit process.
The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management, or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (United States).
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Audit Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Fund's Board of Trustees that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Trustees
Daniel D. Harding, Chairman
Kinchen C. Bizzell
Elizabeth C. Bogan
Kuni Nakamura
November 13, 2018
The Audit Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Audit Committee is composed of four of the Fund's Independent Trustees, Messrs. Harding (Chairman), Bizzell, and Nakamura, and Dr. Bogan. The Fund has certified that each member of the Audit Committee is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including those of the Fund. Mr. Harding has been designated as the Fund's audit committee financial expert, as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K (the "Audit Committee Financial Expert").
Nominating Committee
The Board of Trustees has a Nominating Committee composed of three of the Fund's Independent Trustees, Messrs. Melarkey (Chairman), Fahrenkopf, Jr., and Platt. Each Nominating Committee Member is an Independent Trustee as determined under guidelines of the NYSE American. The Nominating Committee met once during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending qualified candidates to the Board in the event that a position is vacated or created. In considering candidates submitted by shareholders, the Nominating Committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board, the qualifications of the candidate, and the interests of shareholders.
The Nominating Committee believes that the minimum qualifications for serving as a Trustee of the Fund are that the individual demonstrate, by significant accomplishment in his or her field, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to the Board of Trustees' oversight of the business and affairs of the Fund and have an impeccable record and reputation for honest and ethical conduct in both his or her professional and personal activities. In addition, the Nominating Committee examines a candidate's specific experiences and skills, time availability in light of other commitments, potential conflicts of interest, and independence from management and the Fund. The Fund has adopted specific Trustee qualification requirements that can be found in the Fund's By-Laws and are applicable to all individuals who may be nominated, elected, appointed, qualified or seated to serve as Trustees. The qualification requirements include: (i) age limits (at least 21 years of age and such maximum age as the Trustees may in the future determine); (ii) prohibitions regarding any legal disability; (iii) limits on service on other boards; (iv) restrictions on relationships with investment advisers other than the Fund's adviser; and (v) character and fitness requirements. Additionally, each Independent Trustee must not be an "interested person" of the Fund as defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and may not be or have certain relationships with a shareholder beneficially owning five percent or more of the Fund's outstanding shares or specified levels of interest in registered investment companies. The Fund's By-Laws also provide that a majority of the Trustees then in office may determine by resolution that a failure to satisfy a particular qualification requirement will not present undue conflicts or impede the ability of the candidate to discharge the duties of a Trustee or the free flow of information among Trustees or between the Fund's adviser and the Board. Reference is made to the Fund's By-Laws for more details.
The Nominating Committee also considers the overall composition of the Board, bearing in mind the benefits that may be derived from having members who have a variety of experiences, qualifications, attributes, or skills useful in overseeing a publicly traded, highly regulated entity such as the Fund. The Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying trustee candidates. For a discussion of experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills supporting the appropriateness of each Trustee's service on the Fund's Board, see the biographical information of the Trustees above in the section entitled "Information About Trustees and Officers."
The Board of Trustees adopted a Nominating Committee Charter on November 18, 2015. The charter is available in the Closed-End Funds â Corporate Governance Section on the Fund's website at www.gabelli.com.
Other Board Related Matters
The Board of Trustees has established the following procedures in order to facilitate communications among the Board and the shareholders of the Fund and other interested parties.
Receipt of Communications
Shareholders and other interested parties may contact the Board or any member of the Board by mail or electronically. To communicate with the Board or any member of the Board, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or the Board member(s) with whom you wish to communicate either by name or title. All such correspondence should be sent to Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund Ltd., c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422. To communicate with the Board electronically, shareholders may go to the corporate website at www.gabelli.com under the heading "Contact Us/Email Addresses/Board of Directors (Gabelli Closed-End Funds)."
Forwarding the Communications
All communications received will be opened by the office of the General Counsel of the Adviser for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to one or more Trustees. The office of the General Counsel will forward promptly to the addressee(s) any contents that relate to the Fund and that are not in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service, or patently offensive or otherwise objectionable material. In the case of communications to the Board of Trustees or any committee or group of members of the Board, the General Counsel's office will make sufficient copies of the contents to send to each Trustee who is a member of the group or committee to which the envelope or e-mail is addressed.
The Fund does not expect Trustees or nominees for election as Trustee to attend the Meeting. No Trustee or nominee for election as Trustee attended the Fund's annual meeting of shareholders held on May 14, 2018.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the compensation of the Trustees and officers, if any, who were compensated by the Fund rather than the Adviser, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and by the Fund Complex for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018.
COMPENSATION TABLE
Required Vote
The election of each of the listed nominees for Trustee of the Fund requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the Common Shares of the Fund present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting if a quorum is present. A "plurality" vote means that the nominees who receive the largest number of votes cast (even if they receive less than a majority) will be elected as trustees. Since the nominees are running unopposed, each nominee only needs one vote to be elected if there is a quorum present at the Meeting.
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH NOMINEE.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Recent Change in Auditor
Effective February 22, 2018, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, upon recommendation and approval of the Audit Committee, dismissed Tait Weller & Baker LLP ("Tait Weller") as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to serve in this role for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.
Tait Weller's report on the financial statements of the Fund for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and the subsequent interim period through February 22, 2018, there were no "disagreements" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) with Tait Weller on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Tait Weller, would have caused Tait Weller to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with their reports on the Fund's financial statements for such fiscal years.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and the subsequent interim period through February 22, 2018, there were no "reportable events" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The Fund provided Tait Weller with a copy of the foregoing disclosure in accordance with the requirements of Instruction 2 to Item 304 of Regulation S-K. Tait Weller did not indicate that it believed the foregoing disclosure was incorrect or incomplete.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and the subsequent interim period prior to engaging PricewaterhouseCoopers, neither the Fund, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted with PricewaterhouseCoopers with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might have been rendered on the Fund's financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided that PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded was an important factor considered by the Fund in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
PricewaterhouseCoopers, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017, has been selected to serve as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. The Fund knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Fund. Representatives of Tait Weller and PricewaterhouseCoopers will not be present at the Meeting, but will be available by telephone and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if asked, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Set forth in the table below are audit fees and non-audit related fees billed to the Fund by Tait Weller for professional services received during and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and PricewaterhouseCoopers for professional services received during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
The Fund's Audit Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund, and all non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund's Adviser and service providers controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Fund's Adviser ("affiliates") that provide ongoing services to the Fund (a "Covered Services Provider"), if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee may delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such audit and permissible non-audit services to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and the Chairman must report his decision(s) to the Audit Committee, at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairman's pre-approval of such services. The Audit Committee may also establish detailed pre-approval policies and procedures for pre-approval of such services in accordance with applicable laws, including the delegation of some or all of the Audit Committee's pre-approval responsibilities to other persons (other than the Adviser or the Fund's officers). Pre-approval by the Audit Committee of any permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Adviser, and any Covered Services Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its independent registered public accounting firm during the year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided; (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee or the Chairman prior to the completion of the audit. All of the audit, audit related, and tax services described above for which Tait Weller and PricewaterhouseCoopers billed the Fund fees for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30,2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. All other fees for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 reflected in the table above were for issuance of a consent and comfort letter for the filing of Form N-2.
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, Tait Weller and PricewaterhouseCoopers have represented to the Fund that they did not provide any non-audit services (or bill any fees for such services) to the Adviser or any Covered Services Provider.
The Audit Committee was not required to consider whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Adviser or Covered Service Providers that were not pre-approved was compatible with maintaining Tait Weller's or PricewaterhouseCoopers's independence.
The Investment Adviser and Administrator
Gabelli Funds, LLC is the Fund's Adviser and Administrator and its business address is One Corporate Center, Rye, New York 10580-1422.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, require the Fund's executive officers and Trustees, executive officers and directors of the Adviser, certain other affiliated persons of the Adviser, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Fund's securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE and to furnish the Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on the Fund's review of the copies of such forms it received, if any, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Fund believes that during that year such persons complied with all such applicable filing requirements.
Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions
For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, abstentions (or "withheld votes" with respect to the election of Trustees) and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present but that have not been voted. Accordingly, shareholders are urged to forward their voting instructions promptly.
Because the Fund requires a plurality of votes to elect each nominee for Trustee, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast, but will have no effect on the result of the vote. Abstentions and any broker non-votes, however, will be considered to be present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.
Brokers holding shares of the Fund in "street name" for the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such customers and clients on how to vote their shares on Proposal 1 before the Meeting. Under the rules of the NYSE, such brokers may, for certain "routine" matters, grant discretionary authority to the proxies designated by the Board to vote if no instructions have been received from their customers and clients prior to the date specified in the brokers' request for voting instructions. Proposal 1 is a "routine" matter and accordingly beneficial owners who do not provide proxy instructions or who do not return a proxy card may have their shares voted by broker-dealer firms in favor of Proposal 1. A properly executed proxy card or other authorization by a beneficial owner of shares that does not specify how the beneficial owner's shares should be voted on Proposal 1 may be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of the proposal.
Shareholders of the Fund will be informed of the voting results of the Meeting in the Fund's Semiannual Report for the six months ended March 31, 2019.
"Householding"
Please note that only one document (i.e., an annual or semiannual report or set of proxy soliciting materials) may be delivered to two or more shareholders of the Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of a document, or for instructions regarding how to request a separate copy of these documents or regarding how to request a single copy if multiple copies of these documents are received, shareholders should contact the Fund at the address and phone number set forth above.
OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING
The Trustees of the Fund do not intend to present any other business at the Meeting, nor are they aware that any shareholder intends to do so. If, however, any other matters, including adjournments, are properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their judgment.
SHAREHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS
All proposals by shareholders of the Fund that are intended to be presented pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act ("Rule 14a-8") at the Fund's next Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2020 (the "2020 Annual Meeting") must be received by the Fund for consideration for inclusion in the Fund's 2020 proxy statement and 2020 proxy relating to that meeting no later than December 5, 2019. Rule 14a-8 specifies a number of procedural and eligibility requirements to be satisfied by a shareholder submitting a proposal for inclusion in the Fund's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8. Any shareholder contemplating submissions of such a proposal is referred to Rule 14a-8.
The Fund's By-Laws require shareholders that wish to nominate Trustees or make proposals to be voted on at an Annual Meeting of the Fund's Shareholders (and which are not proposed to be included in the Fund's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8) to provide timely notice of the nomination or proposal in writing. To be considered timely for the 2020 Annual Meeting, the shareholder notice (and information summarized below and described fully in the Fund's By-Laws) must be sent to the Fund's Secretary, c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422, and must be received by the Secretary no earlier than December 15, 2019 and no later than January 14, 2020; provided, however, that if the 2020 Annual Meeting is to be held on a date that is earlier than April 18, 2020 or later than June 7, 2020, such notice must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever occurred first. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public announcement of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
In order for a shareholder of record to propose a nominee for Trustee, such shareholder must furnish written notice setting forth specified information about the nominee and associates of the nominee, the shareholder(s) of record (and if different, each beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is being made) and associates of the shareholder(s), as well as an executed certificate by the nominee relating to the nominee's disclosure of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Fund in connection with service as a Trustee of the Fund, the nominee's consent to serve as a Trustee if elected and the nominee's satisfaction of the Trustee qualifications set forth in the Fund's governing documents. If requested by the Nominating Committee, the proposing shareholder will need to also submit a completed and signed trustee's questionnaire, including a supplement, relating to the nominee's satisfaction of the qualifications requirements set forth in the governing documents.
The foregoing description of the procedures for a shareholder of the Fund properly to make a nomination for election to the Board or to propose other business for the Fund is only a summary and is not complete. Copies of the Fund's governing documents, including the provisions that concern the requirements for shareholder nominations and proposals, are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The Fund will also furnish, without charge, a copy of its governing documents to a shareholder upon request, which may be requested by writing to the Fund's Secretary, c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422. Any shareholder of the Fund considering making a nomination or other proposal should carefully review and comply with those provisions of the Fund's governing documents.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PROXIES BE RETURNED PROMPTLY.
SHAREHOLDERS MAY PROVIDE THEIR VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR THE INTERNET BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCOMPANYING THE PROXY CARD, VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM OR SET FORTH IN THE NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS.
