To Our Shareholders: 
On behalf of our Board of Directors, I am pleased to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 9, 2019. The meeting will be held at the Benson Hotel located in Portland, Oregon. The annual meeting will include an update on our business operations and a discussion of other important matters. We hope you can attend and look forward to seeing you there. 
Our values and culture are the foundation for our strong performance and transformative growth over the last five years 
When we were a much smaller enterprise, I defined the core values to guide Greenbrier, including quality, integrity, respect for people, safety and customer commitment. As we have grown we strive to maintain these values that have long defined us. We believe an enduring commitment to these values is essential to Greenbrier's long-term growth. Success in a manufacturing environment cannot be sustained without daily focus on keeping our employees safe and healthy. Serving our customers by designing and delivering high-quality products and services is another manifestation of our values. 
Our Board is actively engaged in Greenbrier's strategic direction 
At Greenbrier, strong corporate governance is foundational to our success. A highly engaged Board of Directors helps Greenbrier test our understanding of our markets and industry trends. The Board meets annually to review the Company's strategic plan. This year, the Board traveled to several of our worldwide locations to deepen their understanding of our customers, markets, and the cultures where we operate. Active engagement by the Board enables Greenbrier to refine our strategic direction to optimize long-term growth while maximizing current opportunities. 
Our growth continues to be guided by diversity of thought, expression and background 
Diversity helps business, society and individuals meet our highest potential. Greenbrier maintains a culture of diversity and works with others who share this commitment. Greenbrier's company-wide talent development initiative emphasizes the importance of workplace diversity. Diversity is not limited to people. While maintaining focus on our key North American market, we continue to pursue new opportunities in geographically and culturally diverse markets around the world. Our growing worldwide footprint and international operations requires heightened cultural awareness from our Board and management team. International diversity allows us to better serve our customers and shareholders in many ways: supplementing our product offerings, accessing new markets and introducing new ideas and viewpoints. 
We are committed to continuing engagement with our stakeholders 
Greenbrier's pursuit of growth and innovation is the result of committed focus on what has guided our success until now. This includes unwavering dedication to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. We regularly engage with customers, attend investor conferences, hold quarterly employee meetings, take an active leadership role in industry associations and contribute our time and resources to community improvement efforts. Greenbrier maintains a commitment to meaningful interactions with our stakeholders. Over time we have emerged as one of the most trusted and respected firms in the freight rail transportation industry. This respect has made us the second-largest freight railcar builder in North America and the largest in South America and Europe. We work to earn this respect and be worthy of it, each day of the year.

Whether or not you can attend the annual meeting in person, and no matter how many shares you own, please vote your shares as soon as possible. Your vote is very important. You may vote via the internet, by mail or by telephone following the instructions provided in the proxy statement.

William A. Furman

The Governance Committee considers diversity of gender, race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, age, cultural background, geographical and professional experience in evaluating candidates for membership on the Board. The Governance Committee believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors, considered as a group, should provide a diverse mix of skills, knowledge, attributes and experiences that cover the spectrum of areas that affect the Company's business. In general, the composition of the Board is diversified across financial, accounting, legal, operational and corporate governance expertise, as well as expertise within the Company's business and industry, including experience in global markets, manufacturing, finance and rail. Candidates for director nominees are considered in the context of current perceived needs of the Board as a whole and the Governance Committee regularly assesses whether the mix of skills, experience and background of our Board is appropriate for the Company. 
Director Continuing Education and Annual Evaluation 
In addition to maintaining a comprehensive orientation program for all new directors, Greenbrier supports continuing education programs and performs annual evaluations to ensure the Board operates at the highest level. These measures contribute to increased levels of Board skills and knowledge and understanding of best practices and current trends. Led by the Governance Committee, the Board conducts an annual evaluation of itself, its committees and the directors, individually, to determine whether, in its judgment, the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. The Company is continually seeking to improve its performance including additional training when a director assumes a new leadership role. The Company pays the reasonable expenses of directors who attend continuing education programs. 
Recommendations and Nominations for Directors 
The Board, with the support of the Governance Committee, maintains a comprehensive process for the selection and nomination of directors. 
In addition to specific skills and relevant experience required for the Board to be effective, all directors are expected to possess certain personal traits including: 
During fiscal year 2018, the Governance Committee focused on selecting and recommending director nominees for election at the Annual Meeting; developing and recommending corporate governance principles to guide the Company; and developing and overseeing programs for the evaluation of the Board, its committees and management, all in accordance with its charter. 
The Governance Committee receives suggestions for potential director nominees from many sources, including members of the Board, advisors and shareholders. Any such nominations, together with appropriate biographical information, should be submitted to the Governance Committee in accordance with the Company's policies governing submissions of nominees discussed below. Any candidates submitted by a shareholder or shareholder group are reviewed and considered by the Governance Committee in the same manner as other candidates. Any shareholder that would like to nominate a candidate for election to the Board should submit a written notice of nomination to the Governance Committee in accordance with the procedures described in this Proxy Statement under "Shareholder Proposals" on page 46. Upon completion of the review process, the Governance Committee makes its recommendation to the full Board. The Board then selects candidates for nomination for election by shareholders or by appointment to fill vacancies. We do not currently employ an executive search firm, or pay a fee to any other third party, to locate qualified candidates for director positions, though we may decide to do so in the future.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and FCPA Compliance 
At Greenbrier we observe the highest ethical standards in all of our business dealings. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics guides our Board, executives and employees in the work they do for the Company. We work hard to ensure that all of our employees fully understand and are empowered to implement ethical practices and promptly report any suspicious activity. The Company maintains the right to require any employee to supply a written statement certifying compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all of the Company's directors, employees and consultants, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. 
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is closely tied to our FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and Anti-Corruption Policy. We are an international company, and as such compliance with all anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws is a key component of our ethics focus. In accordance with FCPA standards, we prohibit improperly influencing business decisions or improperly securing advantages. Our compliance team conducts ongoing compliance training at all of our locations across the globe. This dedication helps to ensure that our personnel are aware of their compliance obligations and best-equipped to implement them. We know that a commitment to the highest ethical standards drives our business and we are guided by this commitment. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Mr. Furman serves as Chairman of our Board, in addition to his roles as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. At this time, in view of Mr. Furman's long experience and service to the Company in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer and director, the Board believes the most appropriate Board leadership structure is for Mr. Furman to continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. 
In his position as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Furman is responsible for the day-to-day leadership and performance of the Company. In his role as Chairman of the Board, Mr. Furman sets the strategic priorities for the Board, presides over its meetings, and communicates its recommendations, decisions, and guidance to the other members of senior management. The Board believes that the combination of these two roles with Mr. Furman enhances consistent communication and coordination throughout the organization. It also provides for effective and efficient implementation of corporate strategy. In addition, Mr. Furman is the most knowledgeable member of the Board regarding the Company's business and challenges, and the risks the Company faces. In his role as Chairman, Mr. Furman is able to facilitate the Board's oversight of those matters most effectively. The Board has not adopted a specific policy on whether the same person should serve as both the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board or, if the roles are separate, whether the Chairman should be selected from the non-employee directors or should be an employee. The Board believes it is appropriate to retain the discretion and flexibility to make these determinations from time to time as needed to provide appropriate leadership for the Company. 
The Board has established a Lead Director position effective when the Chairman of the Board is not an independent director. The Board has appointed Duane C. McDougall to serve as our Lead Director. The Lead Director serves as a representative for the independent directors and presides at all Board meetings at which the Chairman of the Board is not present, including executive sessions of the non-employee directors. 
Director Independence 
As a result of its annual review, the Board has determined that a majority of its directors qualify as independent pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and standards as set forth in the table on page 4. In arriving at this determination, the Board thoroughly considered the consulting arrangement with Mr. Swindells and determined his independence and ability to exercise independent judgment. 
All of our directors who serve on committees satisfy a heightened standard of independence as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines available on the Company's website at http://www.gbrx.com. This heightened standard prohibits directors from serving on a committee if they have any consulting or similar relationship with the Company whereby they receive compensation in addition to their compensation for Board service. Applying this standard further safeguards our Board's autonomy and alignment with shareholders. 
The independent directors met without Company management present at all regularly scheduled meetings of the Board.

Board Committees, Meetings and Charters 
The Board plays a critical enterprise-level oversight function. To effectively carry out this function, the Board maintains three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each committee is composed entirely of independent directors in accordance with SEC and NYSE rules and standards. These directors serving on committees also satisfy our heightened standard of independence described above. Below is a general overview of the role each committee plays in overseeing the business and affairs of the Company.

Strategic Oversight 
Our Board works hard to oversee the direction of Greenbrier and to represent the interests of our shareholders. Navigating a course for growth requires constant engagement and insight into a variety of influences including global economic trends, political and trade considerations, customer needs and employee morale. The Board must be vigilant to an ever-changing business landscape in order to safeguard the Company against adversity. In 2018, our Board traveled to several of our worldwide locations as part of its ongoing efforts on behalf of the Company. The Board made use of this opportunity to tour operations, evaluate new opportunities, attend industry events, engage with a diverse group of employees and executives and deepen their understanding of our business. Our Board's commitment to constructive engagement enables it to better understand our customers, markets and operations. As a result, the Board can tailor the strategic trajectory of the Company to best serve our shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. 
In 2018, the Board has approved management's strategic plan for the Company with four primary goals: 
In addition, the Company's strategic agenda includes: 
The Board regularly conducts reviews of the Company's progress on strategic goals. 
Risk Oversight 
At Greenbrier, risk mitigation is an integral part of the Company's strategic planning process and is divided primarily into two functions: risk management and risk oversight. The Company's executive team is responsible for risk management, including designing processes to identify and mitigate risks. The Board is responsible for risk oversight, which focuses on the adequacy of the Company's enterprise risk management processes designed and implemented by management. The Board administers its risk oversight function primarily through its committees. Each committee oversees risk within its area of responsibility. The committees report significant risk matters to the Board at large, other than those matters that are reported directly to the 
 Board because they do not fall within the purview of any committee. The Board may delegate specific risk-related tasks to a committee or directly to management. 
The Company is confronted with a variety of risks including operational, competitive, business model and compliance risks. Growth involves taking risks, which can evolve over time. Management regularly provides the Board and its committees with a wide array of information to help the Board understand and address the risks facing the Company. The committees consider certain risks regularly. The Audit Committee has oversight of financial, compliance and safety risks. The Governance Committee has oversight of succession planning. 
Specifically regarding compensation risk, the Compensation Committee noted in its fiscal year 2018 annual evaluation numerous ways in which risk is effectively managed or mitigated, including the balance between short-term and long-term incentives and use of multiple performance measures. Based on the results of its evaluation, the Compensation Committee concluded that any risks associated with the Company's compensation programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Majority Voting Policy 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines establish majority voting procedures with respect to the election of directors. Pursuant to the policy, in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee who has received a greater number of votes withheld from his or her election than votes for his or her election will, within two weeks following certification of the shareholder vote by the Company, submit a written resignation offer to the Board of Directors for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the resignation offer and, within 60 days following certification of the shareholder vote by the Company, make a recommendation to the Board concerning the acceptance or rejection of the resignation offer. 
In determining its recommendation to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors its members deem relevant, which may include:

[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider a range of possible alternatives concerning the director's resignation offer as the Committee deems appropriate, which may include: 
Under the policy, the Board will take formal action on the recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote by the Company. In considering the recommendation, the Board will consider the information, factors and alternatives considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and any additional information, factors and alternatives the Board deems relevant. Any director tendering a resignation offer will not participate in the Committee's or Board's consideration of whether to accept such resignation offer. The Company will publicly disclose, in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC, the decision of the Board. The Board will also provide an explanation of the process by which the decision was made and, if applicable, its reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee is now or was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. No member of the Compensation Committee had a relationship with the Company requiring disclosure as a related party transaction during fiscal year 2018. None of the Company's executive officers served as a director or member of a compensation committee or its equivalent for any entity, the executive officers of which entity served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee of the Company during fiscal year 2018. 
Communication with Directors 
Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with members of the Board by mail addressed to the Chairman, to the Lead Director, to any other individual member of the Board, to the full Board, to the non-management directors as a group or to a particular committee of the Board. In each case, such correspondence should be sent to the Company's headquarters at One Centerpointe Drive, Suite 200, Lake Oswego, OR 97035. Such communications are distributed as appropriate. 
Related Party Transactions 
Aircraft Usage Policy. William A. Furman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, owned a private aircraft managed by a private independent management company until December 2017. In December 2017, Mr. Furman sold the aircraft to a third party pursuant to an arrangement in which Mr. Furman provided seller financing to the third-party purchaser. Mr. Furman subsequently purchased a new private aircraft. From time to time, the Company's business requires charter use of privately owned aircraft. During fiscal 2018, charters of the aircraft previously owned by Mr. Furman, before and after its sale to a third party, were placed with the company that managed Mr. Furman's aircraft aggregating approximately $0.5 million. In addition, Mr. Furman's new aircraft was leased directly by the Company for business travel on limited occasions during fiscal 2018 for lease payments aggregating approximately $20,000. Any charter of an aircraft in which Mr. Furman has an interest is subject to the Company's travel and entertainment policy, and the fees paid to the management company or Mr. Furman, as applicable, are no less favorable than would have been available to the Company for similar services provided by unrelated parties. 
Indebtedness of Management. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2018, none of our directors or executive officers has been indebted to us. 
Policy. We follow a policy that all proposed transactions by us with directors, officers, five percent shareholders and their affiliates be entered into only if such transactions are on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties, are reasonably expected to benefit us and are reviewed and approved or ratified by a majority of the disinterested, independent members of the Board. 
2018 Director Compensation 
Members of the Board who are our employees are not separately compensated for serving on the Board. For fiscal year 2018, each non-employee director received an $80,000 annual cash retainer fee. The Audit Committee chairman received an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000, and each other committee chairman received an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000. Duane McDougall, the Lead Director, received an additional annual cash retainer of $70,000. Members of the Audit Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000, and Members of the Compensation and Governance Committees received an additional annual cash retainer of $7,500. All annual retainer fees are paid quarterly.

Under the terms of the Company's 2017 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan, for fiscal year 2018, our non-employee directors received annual grants of restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock with a fair market value equal to $145,000 (rounded up to the nearest whole share) made immediately after the close of each annual meeting, with such shares vesting on the date of the next annual meeting or one year anniversary of the date of grant, whichever occurs first. 
The Company has stock ownership guidelines for its directors, under which all directors of the Company are required to acquire and retain holdings of Company stock. In 2018, the director requirement to hold shares was increased from shares with a value equal to four times the annual cash retainer fee to shares with a value equal to five times the annual cash retainer fee. Four of our eight non-employee directors have satisfied the director share ownership expectation, Thomas Fargo and Kelly Williams have until 2020 to meet the holding requirement, and our two most recently appointed non-employee directors, Wanda Felton and David Starling, have until 2022 to meet the holding requirement. 
In the event a non-employee director ceases to be a director due to death, disability or retirement, or because he or she is not re-elected to serve an additional term as a director, any unvested restricted shares shall immediately become fully vested. If a non-employee director ceases to be a director by reason of removal or resignation as a member of the Board, any unvested restricted shares shall automatically be forfeited, and the shares subject to such award shall be available for grant under the 2017 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan. 
The following table summarizes the compensation of the non-employee Board members for fiscal year 2018.

GOVERNANCE PRIORITIES 
In fiscal year 2019 the Company continues its steady effort to increase transparency with respect to our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") priorities. Our stakeholders trust us to act with integrity and to focus relentlessly on quality. We do this by ensuring that we practice responsible governance, maintain social accountability, respect people, particularly our workforce and promote sustainability. Below are some highlights of the Company current ESG priorities.

       Putting People First   We acknowledge and appreciate that our employees drive our success. We are committed to the continuing health and safety of our employees and recognize it as our number  one priority. We know that our shareholders desire to invest in a company that respects and values its employees.

       Shareholder Engagement   We have implemented a more active shareholder engagement process to specifically engage designated Board members and management with shareholders on matters related to  Board composition, governance and compensation. We invited our top four shareholders, who each owned more than 4% of our outstanding shares at the time, to engage directly with us. No other shareholders owned more than 4% of our outstanding shares  individually at the time.   Board Chairs and management team members were directly involved in  engagement efforts that served to reinforce our open door policy with shareholders. The efforts included:      Specific invitations to top shareholders to meet with us      Meeting with shareholders      Utilizing consultants for best practices in compensation and  governance      Investor road shows and conferences      Presenting shareholder feedback, if any, to the Board      Considering letters from shareholders   Our ongoing engagement efforts allow shareholders the opportunity to provide feedback.

PROPOSAL 2 
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are seeking approval on a nonbinding, advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. We provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote on an advisory basis on the compensation of our named executive officers annually. While this vote is non-binding, consistent with the value we assign to shareholder engagement, we consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our seventh advisory vote on executive compensation passed by a vote of approximately 95% of votes cast, following approval in 2017 by a vote of approximately 98% of the votes cast. We believe that these favorable votes are a result of our continuing engagement with shareholders, and the actions we have taken in response to the feedback we received from shareholders. 
In considering your vote, we invite you to review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 17 of this Proxy Statement. As described therein, we believe that Greenbrier's executive compensation programs effectively align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by linking a significant portion of their compensation to Greenbrier's performance and by providing a competitive level of compensation designed to recruit, develop, retain and motivate talented executives critical to Greenbrier's long-term success. 
This Proposal 2 allows our shareholders to express their opinions regarding the decisions of the Compensation Committee on the compensation paid to the named executive officers through a vote on the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in accordance with the rules of the SEC, which disclosures include the disclosures in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the compensation tables and narrative disclosures following the Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
In order for this Proposal 2 to be approved, the number of votes cast "FOR" approval must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" approval. Broker discretionary voting of uninstructed shares is not permitted on this Proposal 2. Abstentions and broker non-votes of uninstructed shares will not affect the outcome of voting on this Proposal 2.

Chairman and CEO Pay-for-Performance Alignment 
Over the last five years our CEO has led a period of significant expansion in our operations. At Greenbrier there is a direct link between CEO compensation and Company performance. 
The Board of Directors evaluates Mr. Furman's performance and makes incentive pay decisions through assessment of his delivery of operating results and his progress against strategic priorities. In 2018, Mr. Furman led Greenbrier to meet or exceed most of its financial goals in a challenging competitive environment and Greenbrier continues to outperform its direct competitors in North America. At the same time, he made significant progress in positioning the company for the future by increasing our share of the international railcar manufacturing market. Mr. Furman's commitment to our Talent Pipeline initiative has led to meaningful progress toward our succession and leadership bench goals. 
The Board recognized Mr. Furman's 2018 performance by awarding him an annual incentive award of $1.4 million and a 2018 Long-Term Incentive award with a grant date value of $4.8 million. At Mr. Furman's request his annual salary was not increased and remained at $950,000 along with his annual incentive target which remained at 115% of base salary for 2018. 
The following table shows Mr. Furman's annual compensation relative to Total Shareholder Return. 
CEO DIRECT COMPENSATION & TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN 
As seen in the table above, in 2015 there appeared to be a misalignment between our CEO's compensation and our Total Shareholder Return. During 2014 and 2015 rail industry stocks were trading with energy stocks which benefitted from high crude oil prices. The correlation with energy stocks was short-lived and based on market perceptions that crude transport demand would result in significant orders. See our Total Shareholder Return chart on the following page which demonstrates the market exuberance and subsequent correction. Railcars transport a variety of commodities and crude oil is not a major driver of railcar orders. In addition, a five year performance period more accurately reflects performance within our sector in our opinion. When accounting for this market noise, the five year trend of our CEO's compensation is consistent with our strong Total Shareholder Return discussed in more detail on the following page.

RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE METRICS 
The 2018 annual incentive plan performance metrics were weighted 85% to financial goals and 15% to strategic goals. The two financial goals, Adjusted EBITDA and ROIC measures were weighted 75% and 25% respectively as part of the financial goals in calculating our annual incentive compensation payouts. The Compensation Committee believes that these two measures struck an appropriate balance between achieving meaningful earnings relative to the business environment while holding a disciplined capital management strategy through business cycles. Our targets and focus on these measures will vary at different points in the business cycle. Our two strategic goals were selected because of their importance to the Company's strategic plan. 
For long-term incentives, the Adjusted EBITDA and return on equity ("ROE") measures were weighted equally in calculating our performance share results for the 2016-2018 period. The Compensation Committee believes that these two measures struck an appropriate balance between achieving meaningful earnings and maintaining a disciplined investment strategy in all businesses and jurisdictions while emphasizing balance sheet strength and profitability. 
The Compensation Committee considers annual input from management taking into account the macro business environment, backlog of manufacturers' orders in the sector and for the Company, expected delivery schedules and data related to the railroad industry that affects demand including velocity of the railroads, available railcar supply, railcar loading trends and forecasts by commodity and railcar type. 
Payouts and Pay-for-Performance Alignment 
Our compensation program is designed to reward our executives for contributing to the achievement of our annual and long-term objectives through the business cycles. We set robust financial and strategic goals in order to align executive awards with the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. The graphs in this section show our short and long-term compensation plan goals for fiscal year 2018, and our actual achievement for each of Adjusted EBITDA (Pre-Bonus), ROIC, Adjusted EBITDA and ROE. We use these metrics for determining our annual and long-term performance incentives. 
ANNUAL SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN STRATEGIC GOALS 
ANNUAL SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PAYOUTS 
In 2018, our Board of Directors added a specific set of strategic goals to the annual incentive plan of the NEOs. The two strategic goals were:

Under our annual incentive plan, Adjusted EBITDA before bonus for 2018 was $338.7 million and ROIC was 13.9%. The level of performance resulted in incentive payouts of 127.6% for Adjusted EBITDA and 158% for Corporate ROIC and 100% for Strategic Goals for a blended payout of 129.9% of the target award level to the NEOs. See page 25 for more details on our annual incentive plan. 
LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN MEASURES 
(30 MONTHS - MARCH 1, 2016 THROUGH AUGUST 31, 2018) 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PAYOUTS 
Under the terms of our 2016-2018 performance share restricted stock program, our actual results exceeded the target performance goal for Adjusted EBITDA only, which resulted in vesting of 115.4% of the performance-based restricted shares as of the determination date, October 23, 2018. This is lower than it would have been if results had exceeded the target goal for ROE as well. See page 33 for a description of our restricted stock unit ("RSU") program. 
Say-on-Pay Vote 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approximately 95% of shareholder votes cast were cast in favor of a resolution approving the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the 2018 proxy statement. The Compensation Committee believes that the overwhelming vote in favor of the say-on-pay resolution was an affirmation of shareholders' support of our approach to executive compensation. The Company welcomes engagement with shareholders and in years past has made changes in compensation practices in response to shareholder feedback. No additional concerns were raised in fiscal year 2018. Even so, we continue to refine our pay practices and make changes related to our executive compensation plans including extending our measurement period for long term incentives from 30 months to 36 months and adding a relative performance metric for our 2018 long-term incentive award.

BASE SALARY 
Base salary constitutes approximately 14% of total actual direct compensation for our CEO (approximately 28% for our other NEOs). In establishing salary levels, we consider market pay levels, the specific responsibilities and experience of each NEO, and his or her individual performance. As part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee may adjust base salaries for: 
At his request, Mr. Furman did not receive an increase in his base salary in 2018. As a result of the Company's successes, including our continued international expansion, base salaries for Messrs. Rittenbaum, Centurion, Comstock, Downes and Ms. Tekorius were increased effective January 1, 2018 following consultation

ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN DESIGN 
Target incentive opportunities under the annual incentive plan for NEOs are expressed as a percentage of base salary and are intended to be competitive with the market. Please see page 28 for more information on how we determine competitive pay levels. For 2018, our CEO's target incentive opportunities remained unchanged from 2017 levels. Threshold, target and maximum levels for each NEO are presented in the following chart:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Threshold, Target and Maximum Performance Levels assume full achievement of strategic goals.  
[END TABLE]
Our NEOs earn their annual incentive awards under the short-term annual incentive plan based on achievement of pre-established financial performance goals, which for fiscal year 2018 made up 85% of each NEO's total annual incentive award potential, and strategic goals, which for fiscal year 2018 made up 15% of each NEO's total annual incentive award potential. Although not used in 2018, the CEO has discretion to recommend to the Compensation Committee (and the Compensation Committee has discretion in the case of the CEO) to make a downward (but not upward) adjustment of any metrically calculated award of up to 20% to reflect individual performance. 
The performance metrics, their weighting and payout levels are established at the beginning of each fiscal year by the Compensation Committee with input from management and the independent compensation consultant. This process includes a thorough discussion of the risks and variables of management's financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year including existing backlog. The level of financial performance required for the maximum ("stretch") payout is established based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of the level of performance that shareholders would likely consider superior in view of general economic conditions and the economic outlook for 
 Greenbrier and its industry in particular. A comparable process is used to establish the threshold or minimum performance level, defined as the level of financial performance below which no incentive payment is appropriate. 
The Compensation Committee generally structures our executive compensation, including the short-term annual incentive plan, with the goal of maximizing the tax deductibility of executive compensation. However, we may pay compensation that is not deductible from time to time, based upon business needs. For a discussion of tax deductibility of executive compensation in general, see "Regulatory Considerations" on page 29. 
Target Setting for Financial Metrics 
For fiscal year 2018, achievement of financial metrics made up 85% of each NEO's total annual incentive award opportunity. In keeping with our philosophy to incentivize management in both strong and weak markets, the Compensation Committee increased the Adjusted EBITDA goal and decreased the ROIC goal compared to the prior year. These changes were aligned with the Company's strategy to wisely deploy cash and expand internationally while allowing returns in new markets to grow over time. The following table sets forth the financial metrics and goals under the 2018 annual incentive plan: 
2018 Short-term Incentive Financial Measures and Goals 
($ in millions) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Threshold (Minimum)    $244      9.0%      75.0% 
 Target (Goal)    $305    11.0%    100.0% 
 Stretch (Maximum)    $427    16.0%    200.0% 
[END TABLE]
Weighting of the above financial metrics was 75% for adjusted EBITDA and 25% for ROIC. Achievement below threshold results in no payout for the respective metric. Payout amounts are interpolated between threshold and target or target and stretch, as appropriate. In addition, failure to meet the threshold level of adjusted EBITDA means that no payment would be made at all pursuant to the short-term incentive plan, even if the ROIC threshold were achieved. 
Strategic Goals 
For fiscal year 2018, achievement of strategic goals made up 15% of each NEO's total annual incentive award opportunity. The Compensation Committee selected integration of new businesses,

 and talent development and succession planning as the strategic goals for fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee determines the level of achievement of strategic goals for all executive officers (including NEOs) as a group, on a scale of 0 – 100%. "Stretch" levels of performance do not apply to strategic goals. 
LONG-TERM EQUITY COMPENSATION DESIGN 
Process for Granting Awards 
We set target long-term incentive opportunities for our NEOs to be competitive with the market. The value of the annual long-term incentive awards to each NEO is divided equally between two types of equity-based awards: time-based vesting RSUs and performance-based RSUs. During fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to modify the performance period applicable to performance-based RSUs from a 30-month performance period to a 36-month performance period. For fiscal year 2018, the grant date for all annual long-term incentive awards was April 2018. For fiscal year 2019 performance-based grants and on a go-forward basis, we expect that the grant date for performance-based RSUs will typically be in October. We grant RSUs to NEOs at the same time we grant them to other employees. We generally make off-cycle grants (if any) only to newly-hired employees or in connection with significant increased responsibilities or promotions, as approved by the Compensation Committee. No such grants were made in fiscal year 2018. 
To ensure responsible use of shares under our equity program, the Compensation Committee approves a pool for each annual RSU grant with assistance from Mercer. 
In granting RSUs to individuals, the number of shares awarded was guided by dividing the intended value of the award by the then current market price of the Company's Common Stock on the NYSE measured from the date of grant of the award. 
Dividends Paid Only on Vesting 
Commencing with grants made in fiscal year 2018 we do not pay dividends on unearned time-based or performance RSUs. 
Award Types and How Each Fits our Program 
Time-Based RSUs 
Time-based RSUs are designed to create long-term shareholder value and retention of highly qualified leaders. Time-based RSUs vest ratably in the form of Company common stock over a three-year period beginning on the first anniversary following the date of the grant. 
Performance-Based RSUs 
Performance shares are designed to focus attention on, and to reward the achievement of, our long-term financial objectives and sustained appreciation in shareholder value. At the end of the 36 
 month performance period, a percentage ranging from 0% to 200% of the number of shares initially awarded will be earned based on the extent to which the 36-month goals are achieved. The value of each performance share equals the price of one share of our common stock on the date of grant, with payment of earned performance units made in the form of Greenbrier common stock. 
The modified 36-month measurement period beginning on September 1 and ending on August 31 was chosen to coincide with our fiscal year. 
Target Setting 
Our target setting process, conducted at the beginning of each 36-month performance period, combines goals related to earnings and return while taking into account the cyclical nature of our business. Our targets are designed to incentivize behavior which enhances long-term shareholder value at all points in the business cycle. 
For our April 2018 RSU awards we introduced a relative metric – Relative EBITDA Growth. The Company's cumulative EBITDA during the performance period over the prior year multiplied by three years. The result is then compared to our compensation peer group and payouts of 0% to 200% of RSUs awarded are determined based on percentile ranking. The Compensation Committee believes that a relative performance metric further aligns long-term compensation to long-term shareholder returns. In consultation with Mercer, the Compensation Committee is monitoring this change and may modify its approach to relative performance pay in the future. 
We establish our objectives depending on where we are in the business cycle. When backlog and demand are high and asset prices are strong, we emphasize earning a higher return. When the market is weak and prices are under pressure, we emphasize making prudent decisions related to market share and other considerations as well as investments at attractive prices over attempting to earn unrealistic short-term returns. Making intelligent decisions at the right points in the cycle allows us to increase shareholder value over the longer term. 
The Compensation Committee selected Adjusted EBITDA, Relative EBITA Growth and ROIC as the performance metrics for the 36-month performance period beginning on September 1, 2017 and ending on August 31, 2020. Consistent with our objective of striking a balance between earnings growth and respect for capital and ensuring that our management team is incentivized at all points in the cycle, we increased our Adjusted EBITDA goal significantly for the current 36-month performance period over the prior 30-month performance period. 
Weighting of the metrics for fiscal year 2018 is 30% for Adjusted EBITDA, 30% for Relative EBITDA Growth and 40% for ROIC. Achievement below threshold results in no payout for the respective metric.

Payout amounts are interpolated between threshold and target or target and stretch, as appropriate. Vesting is independent for each performance criteria. The Compensation Committee reviewed use of EBITDA metrics for both short and long term compensation plans and believes it is an important metric for incentivizing both short-term and long-term performance and shareholder returns. 
BENEFITS 
Executive Retirement and Insurance Benefits 
Supplemental Retirement Benefits 
The Company maintains a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation ("NQDC") Plan which permits participants to elect to defer a portion of their compensation in excess of amounts that may be deferred under the Company's tax-qualified 401(k) plan, and to defer receipt of shares of stock issuable upon vesting of RSUs. The NQDC does not pay or provide for preferential or above-market earnings. Participants may direct the investment of deferred cash compensation credited to their accounts among a range of investment options similar to those available under the Company's 401(k) plan; shares of Company stock deferred under the NQDC Plan may not be diversified into other investments. The Company's executive officers, including its NEOs, are eligible to defer a portion of their compensation under the NQDC Plan. Messrs. Rittenbaum, Downes and Comstock elected to participate in the NQDC Plan in 2018; none of the other NEOs elected to defer any portion of their 2018 cash or equity compensation under the NQDC Plan. 
The Company makes discretionary employer contributions on behalf of Mr. Rittenbaum and Mr. Centurion under the target benefit component of its NQDC Plan, which has been discontinued for new participants. Target benefit contributions are designed to provide supplemental retirement benefits to the participating executives in an amount equal to 50% of the executive's base salary as of age 65 for 15 years. While the Company intends to make contributions under the target benefit program in the ordinary course that are actuarially designed to provide the target benefit amount, no level of contributions is required and no level of supplemental retirement benefits is guaranteed to executives under the target benefit program component of the NQDC Plan. The Company does not provide tax gross-up payments or other provisions for paying executives' taxes on distributions from the NQDC Plan. 
The Company makes discretionary contributions under the supplemental retirement program component of the NQDC Plan on behalf of executives who do not participate in the target benefit program, including Messrs. Furman, Comstock and Downes and Ms. Tekorius. Such contributions are credited to a Supplemental Retirement Program account on their behalf under the NQDC Plan. In January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved discretionary contributions equal to 6% of participants' annual base salary earned plus actual bonus earned for the prior fiscal year. 
Executive Life Insurance 
The Company provides an executive life insurance program to its executive officers and certain other management employees. The Company owns life insurance policies insuring the executives' lives, and has endorsed the rights to the death benefits to the participating executives. Upon termination of the executive's employment, the Company will transfer ownership of the policy to the executive, resulting in taxable income to the executive at the time of transfer. Each NEO, other than Mr. Furman and Mr. Comstock, participates in the executive life insurance program, and each has an aggregate death benefit amount of $1 million (including previous executive—owned life insurance policies for which no further Company funding is provided) and a target aggregate after-tax cash surrender value at age 62 of $200,000, except for Ms. Tekorius who has a target aggregate after-tax cash surrender value at age 62 of $125,000 and except for Mr. Downes who has no target after-tax cash surrender value. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
The Company provides executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that the Company and the Compensation Committee believe are reasonable and consistent with its overall compensation program goal of enabling the Company to attract, retain and motivate employees for key positions. The Company is selective in its use of perquisites, using perquisites that are commonly provided, the value of which is generally modest and periodically reviewing the levels of perquisites. The Company does not provide tax gross-ups for perquisites or personal benefits. The primary perquisites are use of Company-owned automobiles or automobile allowances and payment of club membership dues. The Company may assist selected transferred or newly-hired executives in selling their homes to facilitate a successful relocation of the executive. 
Change-of-Control Agreements—Double Triggers 
We have entered into agreements with our NEOs that provide certain benefits if employment is terminated following a change of control ("COC"). This protection is provided to ensure the stability, continuity and impartiality of our executives in a COC situation. The level of protection is intended to be similar to that provided by similarly sized organizations. 
The COC agreements are "double-trigger" agreements, meaning that benefits are payable only if a COC occurs and an executive's employment is terminated, or constructively terminated. 
Double-Trigger Equity Vesting 
All equity grant agreements require both a COC event and an executive's actual or constructive termination before vesting is accelerated.

Employment Agreements 
Since 2010, we have not entered into any new employment agreements with NEOs. Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion have employment agreements that were originally entered into prior to 2010. For a description of these key agreements, please see Potential Post Termination Payments. All our COC agreements and employment agreements have been modified so that no tax gross up benefits are provided and we do not offer this feature in new agreements. 
Process for Determining Executive Compensation (Including NEOs) 
The Compensation Committee with input from the independent consultant, regularly reviews: 
Our human resources staff and the CEO also provide input to the Compensation Committee regarding base salary increases, annual incentives, long-term equity incentives and the business and financial goals applicable to earning such compensation. After reviewing these recommendations, the Compensation Committee determines and approves the compensation of each NEO. Our CEO, however, does not participate in, nor is he present during, deliberations on his own compensation. Such deliberations occur during the Compensation Committee's executive sessions. The Compensation Committee also reviews its pay decisions regarding our CEO with the other independent directors of the Board. 
THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET COMPETITIVE PAY 
We have structured our compensation programs to provide total direct compensation opportunities comparable to opportunities provided by companies of comparable size based on several metrics. We use a "peer group" to assist us in determining appropriate compensation and we conduct benchmarking reviews. The complexity of our international integrated business model and the depth of experience required by our NEOs creates a challenge for the Compensation Committee to obtain information on competitive pay levels with precision for our particular business and for specific executive positions. To make final decisions and ensure that we are market competitive to attract and retain talent, the Compensation Committee, with assistance from human resources staff and an independent compensation consultant, regularly reviews information on pay for executives as reported in national compensation surveys by Mercer and Willis Towers Watson. These surveys include compensation information, on an aggregated basis, for approximately 300 companies with annual revenues between $1 and $6 billion. While peer group data and survey data are a starting point for our compensation review process, actual compensation decisions with respect to specific individuals are influenced by a variety of factors including experience, tenure, skills, unique responsibilities, individual performance and anticipated advancement in our succession strategy, and our specific talent requirements. 
PEER GROUP 
Our peer group referred to when developing our fiscal year 2018 compensation program included the 18 companies listed below. The Compensation Committee, together with Mercer, periodically reviews and, as appropriate, may approve changes to our peer group. For fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee made no changes to our peer group. Our 2019 peer group is:

Compensation Governance 
STOCK OWNERSHIP AND STOCK RETENTION 
The Company has stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers, under which all executive officers of the Company are expected to retain holdings of Company stock with a value equal to a multiple of base salary ranging from one to five times base salary depending on the executive officer's position with the Company, as set forth below.

 EVP, Brian J. Comstock    2.5x   Yes 
 SVP, Adrian J. Downes    2x   Yes 
[END TABLE]
Executive officers are expected to achieve compliance with the applicable guidelines within five years of the date of adoption of the guidelines or appointment as an executive officer, whichever is later. They are encouraged to retain ownership of shares representing at least 50% of the after-tax value acquired through compensatory stock awards until the guidelines are met. All of our executive officers have satisfied the executive stock ownership expectation. 
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CLAW-BACK POLICY 
The Company has adopted an incentive compensation claw-back policy intended to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to adopt a policy that will recapture ("claw-back") excess incentive compensation, if any, that is paid to certain executives based on erroneous financial statements, and mandates the SEC to issue rules implementing the claw-back requirements. Although the SEC has not yet promulgated final rules implementing the Dodd-Frank claw-back requirements, in 2013 the Company determined to adopt a claw- back policy in light of concerns expressed by shareholders about the lack of a claw-back policy, and the SEC's delay in adopting final rules. 
POLICIES REGARDING HEDGING AND PLEDGING OF COMPANY STOCK 
The Company's Policy Regarding Trading in Company Securities prohibits its directors and executive officers from hedging the economic risk of owning shares of Company stock and restricts directors and executive officers from holding Company stock in a margin account, or pledging Company stock as collateral for a loan, except in very limited circumstances (not including margin debt) with advance approval of the Chairman and CEO. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT AND COMPENSATION CONSULTANT'S ROLE 
The Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate independent consultants, counsel, experts and other personnel the Committee deems necessary to enable it to fully perform its duties and fulfill its responsibilities, and to determine the compensation and other terms of engagement for such consultants and experts. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee's Charter, the Compensation Committee may delegate to its chair or to one or more of its members the responsibility for performing routine functions. There are no other express provisions in the Charter delegating Compensation Committee authority to any other person. 
The Compensation Committee engaged Mercer to provide information, analysis and advice regarding executive and director compensation. Mercer provided the following services for the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018: (i) advice on 2018 executive officer bonus program structure, performance goals and targets, and bonus amounts; (ii) advice on 2018 executive officer equity grant award sizes and performance goals and targets; (iii) market data and recommendations on executive officer compensation; (iv) advice on equity retention policies and holding requirements after vesting; (v) advice on updating the Company's peer group companies; and (vi) ongoing advice regarding the Company's executive compensation practices to advise whether any such practices should be modified to improve effectiveness or to implement "best practices." 
The Compensation Committee has analyzed whether our compensation consultant, Mercer, is independent, and whether Mercer's work as a compensation consultant has raised any conflicts of interest, taking into consideration the following factors: (i) the provision of other services to the Company by Mercer; (ii) the amount of fees from the Company paid to Mercer as a percentage of Mercer's total revenue; (iii) the policies and procedures of Mercer that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of Mercer or the individual compensation advisors employed by Mercer with an executive officer of the Company; (v) any business or personal relationship of the individual compensation advisors employed by Mercer with any member of the Compensation Committee; and (vi) any stock of the Company owned by Mercer or the individual compensation advisors employed by Mercer. The Compensation Committee has determined, based on its analysis in light of the factors listed above, that Mercer is independent, and the work of Mercer and the individual compensation advisors employed by Mercer as compensation consultants to the Company has not created any conflicts of interest. 
Regulatory Considerations 
Our incentive compensation programs have been designed and administered in a manner generally intended to preserve income tax deductions. The Compensation Committee considered the tax and accounting consequences of using various forms of

 compensation and retains the discretion to pay compensation that is not tax deductible or could have adverse accounting consequences for Greenbrier. 
UMBRELLA PERFORMANCE-BASED PLAN FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
For fiscal year 2018, the Company granted performance-based compensation to its executive officers, including its NEOs, subject to the terms of the Company's Umbrella Performance-Based Plan for Executive Officers (the "Umbrella Plan"). The purpose of the Umbrella Plan is to enable the Company to grant performance based awards to executive officers of the Company that may qualify as "performance-based" compensation for purposes of deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"). Short-term cash incentive awards made under the Company's annual bonus plan for executive officers, and performance-based restricted stock, restricted stock unit and other equity based awards made under the Company's Stock Incentive Plan may be made under the 
 Umbrella Plan. Beginning with the Company's 2019 fiscal year, "performance-based" compensation will no longer be exempt from the Section 162(m) deductibility limitation described below. 
TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Section 162(m) generally limits to $1 million per person the amount that the Company can deduct for compensation paid to certain "covered employees" (generally the CEO, CFO and the three next most highly paid executives). For the Company's 2018 and previous fiscal years, "performance-based" compensation paid to covered employees was not subject to the $1 million limitation. Beginning with the Company's 2019 fiscal year, "performance-based" compensation will no longer be exempt from the Section 162(m) deductibility limitation. Although the Company generally structures executive compensation arrangements with the goal of maximizing tax deductibility, we may pay compensation that is not deductible under Section 162(m) based upon business needs. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
As required by Item 407(e)(5) of Regulation S-K, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with the Company's management the above section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" prepared by the Company's management as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018.

(1)  Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of the shares or RSUs computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,  excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. For purposes of valuation of restricted stock and RSU awards, we assume that no shares or RSUs will be forfeited and performance goals will be achieved at target levels. These amounts reflect the grant  date fair value ($47.90 per share on the April 4, 2018 date of grant), and may not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the NEOs. One-half of each RSU award is time-vested and will  vest in annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, based on continued employment with the Company. One-half of each RSU award is performance-vested. For the  performance-vested RSUs, the grant date fair value is calculated based on the target number of shares which, as of the grant date, was the estimated number of shares to be issued upon vesting of RSUs. If the Company achieves its stretch performance  goals as of the end of the performance period, each NEO will receive additional fully vested shares equal to the number of performance-vested RSUs awarded during fiscal year 2018. Such additional shares, if issued, will be valued as of the date of  issuance. If, for purposes of this footnote, the maximum number of shares issuable under the performance-vested RSU awards, including such additional shares that may be received if stretch performance is achieved (valued as of the date of the  original award because the share value as of the date of issuance after the end of the performance period is not known at this time), had been used in this calculation in lieu of the target number of shares, the amounts in the table for fiscal year  2018 would have included two times the value of the performance-vested RSUs shown in the table, or $7,185,000 for Mr. Furman, $1,616,625 for Ms. Tekorius, $1,437,000 for Mr. Rittenbaum, $1,077,750 for Mr. Comstock and $538,875 for Mr. Downes.

Material Terms of Employment Agreements and Other Arrangements 
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
The Company has employment agreements with Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion. The employment agreements with these NEOs provide for certain payments and benefits in the event the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause. The employment agreements also provide for payments and benefits in the event that the executive is terminated following a change of control of the Company. Details of the payments and benefits triggered by different termination events are discussed and disclosed in tabular format under the heading "Potential Post-Termination Payments," following the Equity Compensation Plan Information table. 
RSU AWARDS 
During fiscal year 2018 the Company granted restricted stock unit awards of 100,000 RSUs to Mr. Furman; 22,500 RSUs to Ms. Tekorius; 20,000 RSUs to Mr. Rittenbaum; 15,000 RSUs to Mr. Comstock; and 7,500 RSUs to Mr. Downes. Each unit represents the right to receive one share of Company stock upon vesting of the unit. Half of the RSUs granted in each individual RSU award are subject to time-based vesting and half of the RSUs are subject to performance-based vesting, as described more fully in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Vesting of unvested RSUs will accelerate in the event of termination of the NEO's employment under certain circumstances, as described below. 
ACCELERATION OF RSUs SUBJECT TO TIME VESTING PROVISIONS 
All unvested RSUs subject to time vesting provisions ("time-based RSUs") held by Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum, Centurion, Comstock and Downes and Ms. Tekorius will automatically vest upon death, disability or retirement pursuant to the terms of the RSU award agreements. In addition, all time-based RSUs held by Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion will immediately vest upon the Company's termination of the executive other than for "cause" pursuant to such executives' individual agreements. For all grants made prior to fiscal year 2018, in the event of a termination of employment during the two-year period following a "change of control" of the Company (as defined in the executives' respective employment or change of control agreements), all time-based RSUs will vest if the termination is by the Company other than for "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the executives' respective employment or change of control agreements). Commencing with 2018 grants, RSUs do not accelerate upon COC if they are assumed or continued by the acquiring company. Any time-based RSUs that are not assumed or continued will accelerate and become fully vested upon COC. In the event of a termination of employment during the two-year period following the COC, time-based RSUs held by the executives that were assumed or continued by the acquiring company will accelerate upon the executive's termination pursuant to the terms of the executive's employment agreement or change of control agreement, as applicable, as described above. 
ACCELERATION OF RSUs SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE VESTING PROVISIONS 
Commencing with 2018 grants, RSUs do not accelerate upon COC if they are assumed or continued by the acquiring company. Any performance-based RSUs that are not assumed or continued would accelerate and become vested based on actual results measured against performance goals as of the COC. In the event of a termination of employment during the two-year period following the COC, performance-based RSUs held by the executives that were assumed or continued by the acquiring company would accelerate and become vested at target upon the executive's termination pursuant to the terms of the executive's employment agreement or change of control agreement, as applicable. 
All unvested RSUs subject to performance vesting provisions ("performance-based RSUs") held by Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum, Centurion, Comstock and Downes and Ms. Tekorius will automatically vest upon death or disability at target levels of performance pursuant to the terms of the RSU award agreements. In the event that any of Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum, Centurion, Comstock or Downes or Ms. Tekorius retires prior to the end of the performance period, the performance-based RSUs held by such executive will continue to vest based on performance during the entire measurement period, and the retired executive will receive a pro-rated number of shares equal to the number of vested RSUs multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months during the performance period that the executive remained in service with the Company and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the performance period. Under the terms of the employment agreements with Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion, upon termination of the executive's employment by the Company without cause or termination by the executive for good reason, all performance-based RSUs will continue to vest based on performance during the applicable performance period and the executive will become entitled to receive the number of shares issuable under the RSUs, if any, based upon the level of performance achieved during the entire performance period. For all grants made prior to fiscal year 2018, in the event of a change of control prior to the end of the performance period, all performance-based RSUs will automatically convert into time-based RSUs, and will vest in equal monthly installments over the performance period. The Compensation Committee will determine the level of performance against performance goals through the date of the change of control, and if such performance exceeds the target level, the recipient will be entitled to receive additional shares, based on the level of performance in excess of target, which shares will be time-vested and will vest in full at the end of the measurement period, provided the recipient remains employed by the Company. In the event that the executive's employment is terminated without cause or for good reason within two years following the change of control, vesting of the converted time-based shares would accelerate, pursuant to the terms of the executive's employment agreement or change of control agreement, as applicable.

POTENTIAL POST-TERMINATION PAYMENTS 
Benefits Triggered on Termination Following a Change of Control 
Amended and restated employment agreements entered into effective August 28, 2012 with Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion provide for certain benefits to these officers if the officer's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by the officer for "good reason" within 24 months after a "change of control" of the Company. Ms. Tekorius, Mr. Comstock and Mr. Downes have change of control agreements that provide for similar benefits upon their termination of employment under these scenarios. 
In the above-described agreements, the definition of "change of control" generally is defined to include the acquisition by any individual, entity or group of 30% or more of our stock, consummation of a merger or consolidation that results in 50% or more of our stock being owned by persons who were not shareholders prior to the transaction, a sale of substantially all of our assets, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or replacement of a majority of the members of the Board by individuals whose nomination, election or appointment was not approved by the incumbent Board. 
"Cause" is generally defined to include the conviction of or a plea of guilty or no contest to a felony or gross misdemeanor under federal or state law which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company or which impairs the executive's ability to perform substantially the executive's duties for the Company. In certain cases, "cause" may also include a willful and continued failure to substantially perform the employee's duties to the Company, a material violation of a Company policy or other written standard, a material breach of fiduciary duty to the Company or refusal to abide by a reasonable and lawful directive following notice and opportunity to do so. "Good reason" generally is defined to include a change in title, position or responsibilities that does not represent a promotion, a decrease in base salary exceeding 5%, a decrease in annual bonus opportunity exceeding 20%, and a home office relocation of over 30 miles.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The employment agreement with Mr. Furman provides for a payment equal to three times the sum of his current base  salary plus the average of the two most recent annual bonuses received by Mr. Furman. The employment agreements with Messrs. Rittenbaum and Centurion provide for a payment equal to two and one half times the sum of their current base salary  plus the average of the two most recent annual bonuses received by the executive. The change of control agreement with Mr. Comstock provides for a payment equal to two times the sum of his current base salary plus the average of the two most recent  annual bonuses received by him. The change of control agreements with Ms. Tekorius and Mr. Downes provide for a payment equal to one and one half times the sum of their current base salary plus the average of the two most recent annual bonuses  received by them. All payments are to be made in a single lump sum within 30 days after the date of termination, unless a delay in payment is required in order to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.   
(2)  If cash severance benefits are triggered, the employment agreements with Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion also  provide that the Company will pay the cost of life, accident and health insurance benefits paid for by the Company at the time of termination for up to 24 months following the termination of employment. Under the terms of his employment agreement,  the Company is required to provide continued health insurance benefits at the Company's expense for Mr. Furman and his spouse until Mr. Furman reaches age 75. The change of control agreements with Ms. Tekorius, Mr. Comstock  and Mr. Downes provide that the Company will pay the cost of all health and welfare benefits paid for by the Company at the time of termination for up to 18 months following the termination of employment. The amounts in the table above represent 12  months of life and health insurance premium payments at the rates paid by the Company for each of these executives as of August 31, 2018.  
(3)  For grants made prior to fiscal year 2018, under the terms of the applicable RSU agreement and each executive's  employment or change of control agreement, as applicable, in the event of the Company's termination of the executive other than for "cause" or, for those executives with change of control agreements, disability, or in the event of the  executive's termination of his or her employment for "good reason," in each case during the two-year period following a change of control of the Company: (i) all unvested time-based shares and RSUs held by the executive will vest;  (ii) all performance-based restricted stock awards will vest at the target performance level; and (iii) all performance-based RSUs will convert into time-based RSUs upon change of control, which as-converted time-based RSUs will become fully vested  upon termination, and if the level of performance against performance goals through the date of the change of control exceeds target(goal) level, the executive will receive additional time-based RSUs based on achievement in excess of target(goal) as  determined by the Compensation Committee, which as-converted time-based RSUs will become fully vested upon the executive's termination. Commencing with 2018 grants, equity awards do not accelerate upon COC if they are assumed or continued by  the acquiring company. Time-based equity awards that are not assumed or continued accelerate and become fully vested upon COC, and performance-based equity awards that are not assumed or continued accelerate and become vested based on actual results  measured against performance goals as of the COC. Upon termination following COC, time-based awards that were assumed or continued accelerate and become fully vested, and performance-based awards that were assumed or continued accelerate and become  vested at target pursuant to the terms of the executive's employment agreement or change of control agreement, as applicable. The amounts in the table above assume that no equity awards are assumed or continued by the acquiring company and  represent the number of shares of unvested restricted stock and RSUs and any additional RSUs issuable to the executive, if any, based on performance through August 31, 2018 multiplied by a stock price of $58.00 per share, which was the closing price  of our Common Stock on August 31, 2018. The expense that the Company would record would differ from the amount above under FASB ASC Topic 718 because the amount of unamortized expense is based upon the stock price as of the date of grant, rather  than as of the date of vesting.  
(4)  The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits under the terms of the target benefit program under the  Company's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the terms of the program, in the event that employment of a participant in the target benefit program is terminated within 24 months following a change of control of the Company by the  Company other than for "cause" or by the executive for "good reason", the Company is obligated to contribute to the program on behalf of each such terminated participant an amount equal to the discounted present value of the  contributions that would have been required had the participant remained employed until age 65. The amount shown in the table above is the amount that would be required to be contributed to the program on behalf of each participating NEO, assuming  that the executive terminated employment as of August 31, 2018 following a change of control. Such amounts are based on the discounted present value of the average amount of contributions made on behalf of each executive during the most recent  three year period.  
(5)  Pursuant to their employment agreements, the Company will provide Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion with  continuation of the Company's customary automobile benefit at the Company's expense, for a period of two years following termination of employment. For each of them, the amount above represents the cost of the post-termination automobile  benefit for two years, based on the current or estimated future annual cost of the executive's leased car or other automobile benefit.  
(6)  Under all of the change of control provisions described above, the amount of change of control benefits each officer will  receive is capped at an amount that will prevent any payments being non-deductible under section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or subject to excise tax under Code  section 4999. The amounts shown in this column are the capped amounts, which are equal to one dollar less than the product of three-times the amount of the officers "base amount," which, as calculated under Code section 280G, is equal to  the average of the officer's W-2 wages over the five-year period preceding the change of control event (or such shorter period as the officer has been employed by the Company).

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Employment agreements with each of Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion, provide for lump sum cash severance payments  equal to two times the sum of base salary plus the average bonus amount. Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion also are entitled to receive a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination, based on the  greater of the average bonus amount or the executive's target bonus amount, and the number of days worked during the year of termination. Since it is assumed that termination is on August 31, 2018, the cash severance benefit amount  includes 100% of the average bonus amount, in addition to the multiples of salary and bonus described above. All payments are to be made in a single lump sum within 30 days after the executive signs a release of claims against the Company, subject  to the potential application of the six-month delay requirement applicable to "specified employees" under IRC §409A.  
(2)  Employment agreements with each of Messrs. Furman, Centurion and Rittenbaum provide for continuation of life, accident and  health insurance benefits paid by the Companyfor up to 24 months following the termination of employment by the Company other than for "cause" or by the executive for "good reason," except to the extent similar benefits are  provided by a subsequent employer. In addition, under the terms of his employment agreement, the Company is required to provide continued health insurance benefits at the Company's expense for Mr. Furman and his spouse until  Mr. Furman reaches age 75. The amounts in the table above represent 12 months of life, accident and health insurance premium payments at the rates paid by the Company for each of these officers as of August 31, 2018.  
(3)  Under the terms of employment agreements with each of Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion, in the event of  termination of the executive's employment by the Company without "cause" or the executive's termination of his employment for "good reason," all unvested time-based shares and RSUs will vest; all performance-based  restricted stock awards will vest at the target performance level, and all performance-based RSUs will continue to vest based on performance during the applicable performance period and the executive will become entitled to receive the number of  shares issuable under the RSUs, if any, based upon the level of performance achieved during the entire performance period. Information regarding unvested restricted stock and RSUs held by the NEOs is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards table  above. The amounts in the table above represent the number of shares of unvested restricted stock and RSUs multiplied by a stock price of $58.00 per share, which was the closing price of our Common Stock on August 31, 2018, and, with respect to  performance-based RSUs held by each of Messrs. Furman, Rittenbaum and Centurion, vesting at currently forecasted levels as of the vesting date. The expense that the Company would record would differ from the amount above as, under FASB ASC Topic  718, the amount of unamortized expense is based upon the stock price as of the date of grant, rather than as of the date of vesting.  
(4)  The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits under the target benefit program under the Company's  Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the terms of their employment agreements Messrs. Rittenbaum and Centurion will continue to be treated as participants in the supplemental retirement plan for two years following termination of  employment. The amount shown in the table above for Messrs. Rittenbaum and Centurion is the estimated amount of two years' additional contributions under the target benefit program for each participating executive, assuming that the  executive's employment was involuntarily terminated as of August 31, 2018.  
(5)  Pursuant to their employment agreements, the Company will provide Messrs. Rittenbaum and Centurion with continued  participation in the Company auto program, at the Company's expense, for a period of two years following termination of employment. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Furman will continue to receive the Company's customary  automobile benefit for three years following termination of employment. The amount above represents the current annual cost of the employees' participation in the Company's automobile program for the applicable period, based on the current  or estimated future annual cost of the executive's leased car or other automobile benefit.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's obligation to pay severance benefits is, in all cases, contingent upon the officer executing a release of claims in favor of the Company. The Company's obligation to pay severance benefits to each of Messrs. Rittenbaum and Centurion is contingent upon the officer's compliance with the terms of a covenant not to compete in favor of the Company for one year following termination of employment.

(1)  Under the terms of his employment agreement, the Company is required to provide continued health insurance benefits at the  Company's expense for Mr. Furman and his spouse until Mr. Furman reaches age 75. The amount in the table represents the annual premium payments at the rates paid by the Company for Mr. Furman as of August 31, 2018.   
(2)  Under the terms of the Company's standard forms of agreements for restricted shares and RSUs, all unvested time-based  shares and RSUs become fully vested upon retirement. Performance-based RSUs will continue to vest based upon performance during the measurement period, and the recipient will be entitled to receive a prorated number of shares, at the end of the  measurement period. Retirement age is 65 for purposes of restricted stock and RSU vesting on retirement, except as otherwise determined at the discretion of the CEO. Only Mr. Furman is eligible to retire. The amounts in the table above  represent the number of unvested time-based shares and RSUs, multiplied by a stock price of $58.00 per share, which was the closing price of our Common Stock on August 31, 2018, plus the value of the pro rata portion of performance-based shares  and RSUs that would have accelerated if the executive had retired on August 31, 2018, assuming that performance goals had been met at currently forecasted levels as of the vesting date. The expense that the Company would record would differ  from the amount above as, under FASB ASC Topic 718, the amount of unamortized expense is based upon the stock price on the date of grant and not on the vesting date.

(1)  Under the terms of his employment agreement, in the event of termination due to death or disability, Mr. Furman (or his  estate) is entitled to receive an amount equal to the prorated portion of the cash bonus which would have been payable to him for the portion of the fiscal year during which he was employed by the Company. Since it is assumed that the triggering  event occurs on August 31, 2018, the amount of estimated cash benefit is equal to a full year's cash bonus, estimated to be the amount of the average of the most recent two years' cash bonuses actually paid to Mr. Furman.   
(2)  Under the terms of his employment agreement, in the event Mr. Furman's employment terminates for any reason,  including death or disability, the Company is required to provide continued health insurance benefits at the Company's expense for Mr. Furman (in the case of disability) and his spouse until Mr. Furman reaches age 75 (or would have  reached age 75, in the case of his death). The amount in the table represents the annual premium payments at the rates paid by us for Mr. Furman as of August 31, 2018.  
(3)  Under the terms of the Company's standard forms of agreements, all unvested shares of restricted stock and RSUs  become fully vested upon termination due to death or disability, with performance-based shares and RSUs vesting at the target level. The amounts in the table above represent the number of shares of unvested restricted stock and RSUs (with  performance shares and RSUs at target level) multiplied by a stock price of $58.00 per share, which was the closing price of our Common Stock on August 31, 2018. The expense that the Company would record would differ from the amount above as,  under FASB ASC Topic 718, the amount of unamortized expense is based upon the stock price as of the date of grant rather than as of the vesting date.

CEO PAY RATIO 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chairman, CEO and President, William A. Furman, to the annual total compensation of our median employee for fiscal year 2018. 
Fiscal year 2018 annual total compensation for our CEO was $7,473,644. The annual total compensation of our median employee was $11,618. The resulting ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was approximately 643 to 1. 
We identified our median employee by examining compensation information derived from payroll records for all employees, excluding the CEO, who were employed by us on August 31, 2018. As of such date, we employed approximately 12,649 people, with 1,685 of these employees located in the United States and 10,964 located outside the United States. In identifying our median employee, we selected actual base salary (for salaried employees) and wages (for hourly employees) for the 12-month period ended August 31, 2018 as the most appropriate measure of compensation and consistently applied that measure to all employees included in the calculation.

PROPOSAL 3 
APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO 2014 EMPLOYEE STOCK 
PURCHASE PLAN 
The Board of Directors has adopted an Amendment to 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Amendment"). The Amendment extends the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan") for an additional five years. The Plan provides a convenient way for employees to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock through payroll deductions and a method by which the Company may assist and encourage its employees to become shareholders. As amended by the Amendment, the Plan will continue in effect until February 29, 2024, subject to the right of the Board of Directors to terminate the Plan at any time. The Amendment extends the Plan, which would otherwise expire on February 28, 2019. The following summary of the material provisions of the Plan does not purport to be complete, and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Plan. A complete copy of the Plan is available in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on November 19, 2014. 
Eligibility 
Except as described below, all regular employees of the Company and designated subsidiaries, including employees who are officers or directors, are eligible to participate in the Plan. Regular employees include employees who have been employed by the Company or a participating subsidiary for at least three consecutive months, who customarily work at least 20 hours per week, and whose customary employment is for at least five months per calendar year. Any employee who owns or would be deemed to own five percent or more of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or one of its subsidiaries is ineligible to participate in the Plan. Approximately 2,877 current employees are eligible to participate in the Plan. Rights of employees under the Plan are not transferable. 
Number of Shares Covered by the 2019 Plan 
The maximum number of shares issuable pursuant to the Plan, or purchasable by the custodian pursuant to the Plan, is 750,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. 
Purchase of Shares 
Each eligible employee may participate in the Plan by filing a subscription and payroll deduction authorization form with the 
 Company. No employee will be allowed to subscribe for shares which, together with shares purchasable under all stock purchase or option plans of the Company, would have a fair market value of more than $25,000 in any one calendar year. The amount deducted from any paycheck may not exceed five percent of the employee's gross amount of base pay for the payroll period. Payroll deductions for any subsequent pay period may be changed by giving written notice to the Company. An employee may change his or her deductions or reinstate participation in the Plan after termination only once during each calendar year. 
Amounts withheld will be remitted monthly to an independent custodian selected under the Plan (the "Custodian"), which will apply the funds, together with the Company's matching contribution described below, to the purchase in the open market of shares of the Company's Common Stock for participating employees. The purchase price for shares purchased under the Plan will be the price at which the shares are purchased by the Custodian in the open market. Brokerage commissions on such purchases will be paid by the Company. 
Administration 
The Board of Directors administers the Plan. The Board may promulgate rules and regulations for the operation of the Plan, adopt forms for use in connection with the Plan, decide any question of interpretation of the Plan and generally supervise the administration of the Plan. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authority for general administration of the Plan. 
Matching Contributions 
The Company contributes to the Plan a monthly matching contribution that is added to the funds contributed by participants during the immediately preceding month (via payroll deductions) for the purchase of shares under the Plan by the Custodian. The matching contribution is the amount necessary to permit participants to acquire shares under the Plan at 85% of the market price paid by the Custodian for such shares, resulting in a 15% purchase price discount.

[END TABLE]
Custodian 
Shares purchased under the Plan will be held by the Custodian. By appropriate instructions from the employee, the shares may be sold for the employee's account or transferred into the employee's own name or into a brokerage account. The Custodian will maintain the records of the Plan. The Plan requires that all cash dividends, if any, in respect of shares held by the Custodian will be automatically reinvested in the purchase of additional shares pursuant to the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 
Expenses 
The Company will pay all the expenses of the Plan, except expenses incurred in connection with the sale of shares for the account of an employee. 
Amendment and Termination 
The Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time amend the Plan in any and all respects, except that without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company the Board of Directors may not extend the term of the Plan. The Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time without notice. 
Tax Consequences of Plan 
The Plan is designed and intended to qualify for preferential tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code §423"). One of the requirements for such qualification is that the Plan must be approved by the Company's shareholders within 12 months of adoption by the Board. If the Plan meets all of the requirements of Code §423, an employee who purchases stock under the Plan will not recognize income for federal income tax purposes on the purchase, but will instead defer the tax consequences until the employee sells or otherwise disposes of the stock. If stock that was purchased under a Code §423 qualified plan is held for more than one year after the date of purchase and more than two years after the beginning of the offering period, a portion of the overall gain will be taxed as ordinary income upon the sale or other disposition. The amount of ordinary income equals the lesser of: (1) the actual gain on sale or other disposition (the amount by which the market value of the shares on the date of sale, gift or death exceeds the purchase price), or (2) the purchase price discount. If the stock is sold or otherwise disposed of within either of the Code §423 holding periods (a "disqualifying disposition"), the employee recognizes ordinary income at the time of sale or other disposition on the amount by which the fair market value of the stock as of the date of purchase price exceeds the purchase price, even if no gain is realized on the sale or disposition of the stock. 
Vote Required for Approval 
The Plan is being submitted to shareholders in order for the Plan to continue to qualify for tax-favored treatment under Code §423. The favorable vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote and which has actually been voted will be required. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of the vote. The enclosed proxy will be voted for or against approval of the Plan, or as an abstention, in accordance with the instructions specified in the proxy form. If no instructions are given on a properly executed and returned proxy, the proxy will be voted for approval of the Plan.

PROPOSAL 4 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS 
For fiscal years 2018 and 2017 KPMG LLP ("KPMG") performed professional services for the Company. 
The Audit Committee has appointed, and recommends the approval of the appointment of, KPMG to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company for fiscal year 2019. Shareholder ratification of the Audit Committee's selection of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by the Company's Bylaws or otherwise. The Board of Directors, however, is submitting the selection of KPMG to the shareholders for ratification. In the event the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG, the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm will be determined by the Audit Committee after careful consideration of any information submitted by the shareholders. 
A representative of KPMG is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
In order for this Proposal 4 to be approved, the number of votes cast "FOR" approval must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" approval. Broker discretionary voting of uninstructed shares is permitted on this Proposal 4. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of voting on this Proposal 4.

Report of the Audit Committee 
Board of Directors 
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is established pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, as amended, and the Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the Charter, as amended, is available to shareholders without charge upon request to: Investor Relations, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., One Centerpointe Drive, Suite 200, Lake Oswego, Oregon 97035 or on the Company's website at www.gbrx.com. 
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is generally to monitor and oversee these processes, as described in the Charter. 
For fiscal year 2018, the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors were Graeme A. Jack (Chairman), Wanda F. Felton, Duane C. McDougall, Donald A. Washburn and Kelly M. Williams. Each member of the Audit Committee who served during fiscal year 2018 is, or during the time of their service was, an independent director as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). The Board annually reviews applicable standards and definitions of independence for Audit Committee members and has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets such standards. 
With respect to the year ended August 31, 2018, in addition to its other work, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed with the Company's management and independent auditors the effectiveness of the Company's  internal controls and the audited financial statements of the Company as of August 31, 2018, and for the year then ended;  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Received from the independent auditors written disclosures and a letter required by applicable requirements of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence and discussed with the auditors the firm's independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based upon the review and discussions summarized above, together with the Committee's other deliberations and Item 8 of SEC Form 10-K, and subject to the limitations on the Audit Committee's role and responsibilities referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements of the Company, as of August 31, 2018 and for the year then ended, be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION 
Voting Securities and Solicitation of Proxies 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by our Board of proxies to be voted at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company. Any proxy may be revoked by a shareholder prior to its exercise upon written notice to the Secretary of the Company, by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by the vote of a shareholder cast in person at the meeting. As of November 7, 2018, there were 32,350,212 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote, and a majority, or 16,175,107 of these shares, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of Business. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote on each matter that may properly come before the meeting. 
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by us. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited personally by our officers and regular employees or by telephone, facsimile, electronic transmission or express mail. We have also engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes as described below. We will pay Innisfree a fee of $10,000 plus customary costs and expense for these services. The Company has agreed to indemnify Innisfree against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with its engagement. We will reimburse brokerage houses, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding proxies and proxy material to their principals. 
Other Business 
Management knows of no other matters that will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. However, the proxy gives discretionary authority to the persons named in the proxy in the event that any other matters should be properly presented to the meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

POLICY REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT 
SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
Purpose and Applicability 
We recognize the importance of maintaining the independent and objective viewpoint of our independent auditors. We believe that maintaining independence, both in fact and in appearance, is a shared responsibility involving management, the Audit Committee, and the independent auditors. 
The Company (which includes consolidated subsidiaries as used herein) recognizes that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (the "Audit Firm") possesses a unique knowledge of the Company, and, as a worldwide firm, can provide necessary and valuable services to the Company in addition to the annual audit. Consequently, this policy sets forth guidelines and procedures to be followed by the Company when retaining the Audit Firm to perform audit and non-audit services. 
Policy Statement 
All services provided by the Audit Firm, both audit and non-audit, must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or a Designated Member (as defined below). Although the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 permits de minimis exceptions, our policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services. Examples of audit and permitted non-audit services include: 
The Audit Committee or a Designated Member may pre-approve at any time up to one year in advance the provision of particular types of permissible routine and recurring audit-related, tax and other non-audit services, in each case described in reasonable detail and subject to any specific annual monetary limit also approved by the Audit Committee or a Designated Member. The Audit Committee must be informed about each such service that is actually provided. 
For each proposed service, the independent auditors shall provide detailed back-up documentation at the time of approval to permit the Audit Committee or a Designated Member to make a determination whether the provision of such services would impair the auditor's independence. Such documentation should be so detailed that there should never be any doubt as to whether any particular service was brought to the attention of, considered and pre-approved by the Audit Committee or a Designated Member. At a minimum, in connection with seeking pre-approval for a proposed service or class of services, the Company's independent auditor shall (i) provide the Audit Committee or Designated Member with a written description of the nature and scope of the service, including the fee structure for the engagement; (ii) describe and discuss with the Audit Committee or Designated Member the potential effects of the service on the firm's independence; and (iii) document the substance of its discussion with the Audit Committee or Designated Member. As an example of the level of detail required for pre-approval, in connection with pre-approval of the preparation of the Company's federal, state and local corporate tax returns, the back-up documentation provided should identify clearly each return, including information on each jurisdiction where a return is to be filed, the type or types of tax return, and how often each return is to be prepared and filed. 
When considering whether to grant an approval, the Audit Committee should consider the nature, scope and fees of the service to be provided to the Company as well as the principles and guidance established by the SEC and PCAOB with respect to auditor independence, including the fact that an auditor cannot (i) function in the role of management; (ii) audit his or her own work; or (iii) serve in an advocacy role for the Company. 
Delegation of Pre-Approval 
The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more designated member(s) of the Audit Committee a "Designated Member"), who is independent as defined under the standards of the NYSE, the authority to grant pre-approvals of permitted services (defined below), or classes of permitted services, to be provided by the Audit Firm. The decisions of a Designated Member to
