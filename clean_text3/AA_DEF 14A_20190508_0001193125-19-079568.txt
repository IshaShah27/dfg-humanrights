Dear Alcoa Stockholders: 
We are pleased to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Alcoa Corporation ("Alcoa," or the "Company") to be held on Wednesday, May 8, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), at the Fairmont Pittsburgh, Grand Ballroom, 510 Market Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222. 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on the matters set forth in the 2019 Proxy Statement and the accompanying notice of the Annual Meeting. The 2019 Proxy Statement (the "Proxy Statement") describes our governance structure, which features numerous governance best practices, and our executive compensation program, which "pays for performance." We believe that both our governance structure and compensation program reinforce our alignment with stockholder interests. Highlights of the detailed information included in this Proxy Statement can be found in the "Proxy Statement Summary" starting on page 4. 
Alcoa's strategic priorities to reduce complexity in all aspects of our business, drive returns, and strengthen our balance sheet, form the bedrock of our commitment to our stockholders to work towards continuous improvement of Company performance with accountability and transparency, through all market cycles. These strategic priorities are guided by our three corporate values—Act with Integrity, Operate with Excellence, Care for People—and together, provide a strong foundation for our actions. 
Your vote is important to us. Whether or not you will attend the meeting, we hope that your shares are represented and voted. In advance of the meeting on May 8, please cast your vote through the Internet, by telephone, or by mail. Instructions on how to vote are found in the section entitled "Proxy Statement Summary—How to Cast Your Vote". 
Thank you for being a stockholder of Alcoa. 
Sincerely,

Proxy Statement (continued) 
Cautionary Statement regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
This Proxy Statement contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as "anticipates," "believes," "could," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "goal," "intends," "may," "outlook," "plans," "projects," "seeks," "sees," "should," "targets," "will," "would," or other words of similar meaning. All statements by Alcoa that reflect expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. These statements reflect beliefs and assumptions that are based on Alcoa's perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors that management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Although Alcoa believes that expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of some of the specific factors that may cause Alcoa's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements, see risk factors described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Report"), filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019, in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described in our 2018 Annual Report are not exclusive and further information concerning our Company and our businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect our operating results or financial condition, may emerge from time to time. Alcoa disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks described above and other risks in the market. 
Incorporation by Reference 
Neither the Compensation Committee Report nor the Audit Committee Report shall be deemed soliciting material or filed with the SEC and neither of them shall be deemed incorporated by reference into any prior or future filings made by us under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate such information by reference. In addition, this document includes several website addresses. These website addresses are intended to provide inactive, textual references only.

Executive Compensation 
Our Compensation and Benefits Committee has adopted an executive compensation philosophy that is based on three guiding principles to drive pay-for-performance and stockholder alignment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Target total compensation—base salary, annual cash incentives ("IC") and long-term equity incentives  ("LTI")—at median, while using annual and long-term incentives to reward exceptional performance and to attract and retain exceptional talent.    
  (2)  Equity is the most significant portion of total compensation for named executive officers ("NEOs") to align the  interests of NEOs with the stockholders.    
  (3)  Annual cash incentive and LTI metrics focus management on achieving the greatest positive impact on financial performance,  without creating undue risk.

[END TABLE]
Alignment of Pay and Performance 
Our executive compensation program is designed so that the LTI and IC comprise the most significant portion of the NEO's total compensation. That means pay is tied directly to performance and stock price. Mr. Harvey's pay as reported in the Summary Compensation Table ("SCT"), reflects the accounting value of LTI at the time of grant and not the value actually received or potentially received from these grants. As a result, we compared Mr. Harvey's SCT Pay, Realized Pay and Realizable Pay with our total stockholder return ("TSR"). Although Mr. Harvey's SCT Pay and Realizable Pay have increased with his role as President and CEO, his Realized Pay has trended with TSR. We define Realizable Pay and Realized Pay as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Realizable Pay is the sum of 1) the "Salary," "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation," and "All  Other Compensation" columns from the SCT plus 2) the value of unvested equity and vested but unexercised stock options as of December 31, 2018 (using the closing stock price of $26.58).    
• Realized Pay is the sum of 1) the "Salary," "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation," and "All  Other Compensation" columns from the SCT plus 2) the amounts reported in the 2018 Option Exercises and Stock Vested table.

  (1)  The information in this column, and as shown in the chart below, reflects Mr. Harvey's entire compensation for  2016, which is lower than his compensation for 2017 and 2018 because Mr. Harvey became CEO on November 1, 2016, when Alcoa became an independent, publicly-traded company upon its separation from Alcoa Inc. (the "Separation"), and  therefore served as CEO for only 2 months of 2016.    
[END TABLE]
As illustrated in the chart below, Mr. Harvey's Realized Pay and Realizable Pay increased from 2016 to 2017 and decreased from 2017 to 2018, which trends with the movement of our stock price during this period and reflects the alignment of Mr. Harvey's pay with our share price. Furthermore, the table below demonstrates that (i) our CEO's Realized Pay and Realizable Pay, since the Separation, are lower than TSR over the same period, and (ii) the SCT representation of his compensation is not aligned with pay actually realized or realizable by him for that period.

Our three core values—Act with Integrity, Operate with Excellence, Care for People—provide the foundation for our approach to corporate responsibility. 
Through the Alcoa Foundation and other programs at Alcoa, the Company engages with local communities and non-governmental organizations on numerous sustainability and related initiatives. Approximately 50% of Alcoa Foundation's annual budget is used toward local initiatives in the areas of education, environment, governance and community enhancement, and the other 50% is dedicated to global signature partnerships and programs focused on climate change and biodiversity.

[END TABLE]
Item 1 Election of Directors 
Alcoa's Board, upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, has nominated 12 directors for election at this year's Annual Meeting to hold office until the next Annual Meeting in 2020. Directors are elected on an annual basis for one-year terms. 
All of the nominees currently serve as directors on the Alcoa Board and were elected to the Board by the stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Each has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement. 
We expect that each director nominee will be able to serve, if elected. If any director nominee is not able to serve, proxies may be voted for substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the Board. 
Majority Voting for Directors 
Alcoa's Bylaws provide a majority voting standard for election of directors in uncontested elections. Each director will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, meaning that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director nominee exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. 
If an incumbent director nominee is not elected in an uncontested election and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee (excluding the nominee, if applicable) then will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board, excluding the nominee, will act on the resignation and publicly disclose its decision in accordance with the Bylaws. 
An election of directors is considered to be contested if there are more nominees for election than positions on the Board to be filled by election at the meeting of stockholders. In a contested election, the required vote is a plurality of votes cast. The election of directors at the Annual Meeting is an uncontested election of directors. 
Director Nominees 
The Board has affirmatively determined that each of the nominees qualifies for election under the Company's criteria for evaluation of directors (see "Minimum Qualifications for Director Nominees and Board Member Attributes"). Below is biographical information about the director nominees and their specific experience, skills, and qualifications that has led the Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee to conclude that they should continue to serve as directors on Alcoa's Board. In addition, the Board has determined that each non-employee director nominee qualifies as an independent director under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") corporate governance listing standards and the Company's Director Independence Standards. See "Director Independence." 
Director Qualifications, Skills, and Attributes 
Our directors have substantial leadership, management, and industrial experience and expertise in the fields of international business, government relations and regulation, and in environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") matters. The diversity of experience of our directors, illustrated in the skills matrix and director biographies below, is brought to bear in Board deliberations, during which multiple perspectives are considered in developing dynamic solutions to achieve our strategic priorities to reduce complexity, drive returns, and strengthen the balance sheet. 
Because the table below is a summary, it does not include all of the skills, experiences, qualifications, and diversity that each director offers. In addition, as described in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, all directors should be, and are, financially literate.

Item 1 Election of Directors (continued) 
As further illustrated below, our directors represent a range of backgrounds and overall experience. Our policy on Board diversity relates to the selection of nominees for the Board. Our policy provides that while diversity and variety of experiences and viewpoints represented on the Board should always be considered, a director nominee should not be chosen nor excluded solely or largely because of race, color, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation or identity. Currently, our Board is 33% women and 17% racially/ethnically diverse, and includes a range of ages: less than 50 (8%); 50-59 (34%); 60-69 (33%); and 70-75 (25%). In selecting a director nominee, the Governance and Nominating Committee focuses on skills, expertise and background that would complement the existing Board, recognizing that the Company's businesses and operations are diverse and global in nature. 
Background information about the director nominees, including their business experience, individual skills, and qualifications that each director contributes to the Board's effectiveness as a whole, are described in the following pages.

Item 1 Election of Directors (continued) 
Nominating Board Candidates—Procedures and Director Qualifications 
Stockholder Recommendations for Director Nominees 
The Governance and Nominating Committee (for purposes of this section, the "Committee") will consider candidates for the Board recommended by stockholders. Any stockholder wishing to recommend a candidate for director should submit the recommendation in writing to our principal executive offices: Alcoa Corporation, Governance and Nominating Committee, c/o Secretary, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. The written submission should comply with all requirements set forth in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Committee will consider all candidates recommended by stockholders who comply with the foregoing procedures and satisfy the minimum qualifications for director nominees and Board member attributes. 
Advance Notice Director Nominations 
Alcoa's Bylaws provide that any stockholder entitled to vote at an annual stockholders' meeting may nominate one or more director candidates for election at that Annual Meeting by following certain prescribed procedures. To be timely, the stockholder must provide to Alcoa's Secretary written notice of the stockholder's intent to make such a nomination or nominations not earlier than 120 days and not later than the close of business 90 days before the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting, except as otherwise provided in the Bylaws. If the number of directors is increased by the Board and there is no public announcement at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting, a previously submitted timely notice will be considered timely with regard to nominees for the new positions on the Board if received before the close of business on the tenth day following public announcement of the increase of the size of the Board. 
If a stockholder intends to nominate directors for a special meeting of the Board at which directors will be elected, to be timely, the stockholder must provide written notice to Alcoa's Secretary not earlier than 120 days prior and not later than the close of business 90 days prior to the special meeting. If the first public announcement of the special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the special meeting, a notice will be timely if received within ten days of the public announcement of the special meeting. 
A stockholder nominating a director for election must provide the information regarding that nominee in the format required by the Bylaws, and otherwise comply with all applicable requirements in the Bylaws. Any such notice must be sent to our principal executive offices: Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858, Attention: Secretary. For the 2020 Annual Meeting, such notice must be delivered to the Secretary no earlier than January 9, 2020 and no later than February 8, 2020. 
Proxy Access Director Nominations 
In addition to advance notice procedures, our Bylaws also include provisions permitting, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth therein, stockholders who have maintained continuous qualifying ownership of at least 3% of outstanding Alcoa Corporation common stock for at least three years to nominate a number of director candidates not to exceed the greater of two candidates or 20% of the number of directors then in office who will be included in our annual meeting proxy statement. Alcoa Corporation first became an independent, publicly-traded company on November 1, 2016 and, as a result, eligible stockholders will first be able to nominate a proxy access candidate for the Company's 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Eligible stockholders who wish to nominate a proxy access candidate must follow the procedures described in our Bylaws. Proxy access candidates and the stockholder nominators meeting the qualifications and requirements set forth in our Bylaws will be included in the Company's proxy statement and ballot. To be timely, an eligible stockholder's proxy access notice must be delivered to our principal executive offices, Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858, Attention: Secretary, no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days before the one-year anniversary of the date that we commenced mailing of our definitive proxy statement (as stated in such proxy statement) for the immediately preceding annual meeting, except as otherwise provided in the Bylaws. For the 2020 Annual Meeting, such notice must be delivered to the Secretary no earlier than October 21, 2019 and no later than November 20, 2019.

Item 1 Election of Directors (continued) 
Minimum Qualifications for Director Nominees and Board Member Attributes 
The Committee is charged with determining the criteria, objectives and procedures for selecting members of the Board. The Board membership criteria are set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the committee will consider such criteria in the context of the existing composition and needs of the Board and its committees. 
Alcoa has adopted the following criteria for identification, evaluation and selection of directors (which apply regardless of the nominator): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Directors must have demonstrated the highest ethical behavior and must be committed to the Companys values.   
✓  Directors must be committed to seeking and balancing the legitimate long-term interests of all of the Companys  stakeholders, including its stockholders, customers, employees and the communities where the Company has an impact. Directors must not be primarily beholden to any special interest group or constituency.  
✓  It is the objective of the Board that all non-management directors be independent. In addition, no director should have,  or appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair that directors ability to make decisions consistently in a fair and balanced manner.  
✓  Directors must be independent in thought and judgment. They must each have the ability to speak out on difficult subjects;  to ask tough questions and demand accurate, honest answers; to constructively challenge management; and at the same time, act as an effective member of the team, engendering by his or her attitude an atmosphere of collegiality and trust.   
✓  Each director must have demonstrated excellence in his or her area and must be able to deal effectively with crises and to  provide advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer and other members of executive management of the Company.  
✓  Directors should have proven business acumen, serving or having served as a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating  Officer or Chief Financial Officer of a significant, complex organization, or other senior leadership role in a significant, complex organization; or serving or having served in a significant policy-making or leadership position in a well-respected,  nationally or internationally recognized educational institution, not-for-profit organization or governmental entity; or having achieved a widely recognized position of leadership in the directors field of endeavor, which adds substantial  value to the oversight of material issues related to the Companys business.  
✓  Directors must be committed to understanding the Company and its industry; to regularly preparing for, attending and  actively participating in meetings of the Board and its committees; and to ensuring that existing and future individual commitments will not materially interfere with the directors obligations to the Company. The number of other board  memberships in light of the demands of a director nominees principal occupation, should be considered, as well as travel demands for meeting attendance.  
✓  Directors must understand the legal responsibilities of board service and fiduciary obligations. All members of the Board  should be financially literate and have a sound understanding of business strategy, business environment, corporate governance and board operations. At least one member of the Board must satisfy the requirements of an audit committee financial  expert.  
✓  Directors must be self-confident and willing and able to assume leadership and collaborative roles as needed. They need to  demonstrate maturity, valuing board and team performance over individual performance and respect for others and their views.  
✓  New director nominees should be able to, and be committed to, serve as a member of the Board for an extended period of  time.  
✓  While diversity and a variety of experiences and viewpoints represented on the Board should always be considered, a  director nominee should not be chosen nor excluded solely or largely because of race, color, gender, national origin or sexual orientation or identity. In selecting a director nominee, the Governance and Nominating Committee will focus on any  special skills, expertise or background that would complement the existing Board, recognizing that the Companys businesses and operations are diverse and global in nature.  
✓  Directors should have reputations, both personal and professional, consistent with the Companys image and  reputation.  
[END TABLE]
Process of Evaluation of Director Candidates 
Candidates for nomination to the Board may be suggested by current directors, members or management, stockholders, or a third-party search firm engaged to assist with director recruitment. Based upon the recommendations of the Committee, the Board will recommend director nominees to the stockholders, and is responsible for selecting directors to fill vacancies

 between stockholder meetings. The Committee will make a preliminary review of a prospective candidate's background, career experience and qualifications based on available information. If a consensus is reached by the Committee that a particular candidate would likely contribute positively to the Board's mix of skills and experiences, the Committee will conduct interviews with the candidate and may invite other Board members or senior Alcoa executives to interview the candidate to assess the candidate's overall qualifications. The Committee will consider the candidate against the criteria it has adopted in the context of the Board's then current composition and the needs of the Board and its committees, and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the candidate should be nominated for election. This procedure is the same for all candidates, including director candidates identified by stockholders. 
Non-Employee Director Compensation Program 
Our non-employee director compensation program is designed to attract and retain outstanding director candidates who have the requisite experience and background as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as to recognize the substantial time and effort necessary to exercise oversight of a complex global organization like Alcoa and fulfill the other responsibilities required of our directors. Non-employee directors receive a retainer of cash and equity-based compensation totaling $240,000 per year (plus committee service fees, if applicable) for service on the Board. In addition, Mr. Morris receives a non-executive Chairman fee in the amount of $150,000, which amount was recommended to the Board by the Committee based on a comparative market analysis prepared by Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance"), the independent compensation consultant selected by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Mr. Harvey, our sole employee director, does not receive additional compensation for his Board service. 
Consistent with its charter, the Committee reviews director compensation periodically and recommends changes to the Board as it deems appropriate. In 2018, the Committee reviewed the director compensation program based on a market analysis, provided by Pay Governance, of Alcoa's program relative to non-employee director compensation programs of companies in the CEO compensation benchmarking peer group (as set forth under the "Executive Compensation" section), which concluded that overall compensation is slightly below market median. No changes were made to the non-employee directors compensation program in 2018.

Stock Ownership Guideline for Non-Employee Directors 
To further align the interests of directors with the long-term interests of our stockholders, non-employee directors are required to own, until retirement from the Board, at least $750,000 of our common stock, including restricted share units. Cash-settled deferred share units relating to Alcoa common stock (acquired at Separation due to certain directors' service on the board of our former parent company pursuant to the Deferred Fee Plan) are counted for purposes of meeting the stock ownership requirement. Whether non-employee directors hold shares of Alcoa common stock, restricted share units, or deferred share units, they have the same economic interest in the performance of the Company, which further aligns the directors' interests with those of our stockholders. Non-employee directors are expected to invest 50% of their annual compensation in Alcoa stock (or stock equivalents), until they satisfy the director stock ownership guideline, and they are required to maintain that investment until they retire from the Board. It is the opinion of the Board that this policy reinforces a focus on long-term stockholder value.

Corporate Governance 
The Board has adopted a number of policies to support our values and good corporate governance, which are central to the success of our business and in advancing stockholder interests. 
Corporate Governance Highlights 
The following governance documents are available on our website, www.alcoa.com, under "Investors—Corporate Governance—Governance Documents." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws  
• Committee Charters  
• Corporate Governance Guidelines, including Director Independence Standards  
• Code of Conduct  
[END TABLE]
Paper copies of the documents listed above can be obtained by writing to the Alcoa Corporation, Attention: Secretary, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. 
Please see the Proxy Statement Summary for highlights of Alcoa's corporate governance program. You can find details about these and other corporate governance policies and practices within this Proxy Statement. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are designed to assist the Board in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities to the Company. They reflect the Board's commitment to monitor the effectiveness of decision-making at the Board and management level with a view to achieving Alcoa's strategic objectives. They are subject to modification by the Board at any time. 
Code of Conduct 
The Company's Code of Conduct applies equally to the directors and to all officers and employees of the Company, as well as those of our controlled subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures. The Code of Conduct incorporates a Code of Ethics applicable to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other Financial Professionals, including the principal accounting officer. We conduct annual surveys regarding compliance with the policies. 
Only the Audit Committee can amend or grant waivers from the provisions of the Code of Conduct, and any such amendments or waivers applicable to directors and executive officers will be posted promptly on our website, www.alcoa.com. No waivers have been granted. 
Online training on the Code of Conduct is mandatory for all salaried employees. Shop floor employees complete live training, which includes materials focused on the Company's policies and procedures and information on how to ask questions and raise concerns through the Company's Integrity Line and other resources. 
Board Information 
Director Independence 
Providing objective, independent judgment is at the core of the Board's oversight function. Under the Company's Director Independence Standards, which conform to the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE, a director is not considered "independent" unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company or any subsidiary in the consolidated group. The Director Independence Standards include a list of categories of material relationships affecting the determination of a director's independence. Any relationship that falls below a threshold set forth in the Director

Corporate Governance (continued) 
 Independence Standards, or is not otherwise listed in the Director Independence Standards or the NYSE listing standards, and is not required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K, is deemed to be an immaterial relationship. 
The Board has affirmatively determined that all the directors are independent except Mr. Harvey, who is employed by the Company (and therefore does not meet the independence standards set forth in the NYSE listing standards and Director Independence Standards). In the course of making its determination regarding independence, the Board did not find any material relationships that would impair a director's independence, other than Mr.  Harvey's employment. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Company's current Board leadership structure provides for a non-executive Chairman of the Board who is appointed by the independent directors of the Board. The Board believes this current structure of separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer allows for better alignment of corporate governance with the interests of stockholders. The Board also believes that this structure allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on operating and managing the Company and the Chairman to provide guidance and oversight. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the non-executive Chairman will: call and chair all meetings of the Board, including executive sessions of the independent directors; chair the annual stockholders meeting; ensure that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication with major stockholders or joint venture partners, as appropriate; oversee Board governance, including approval of meeting agendas and meeting schedules to assure that all agenda items are adequately addressed; ensure personal availability for consultation and communication with independent directors; call special meetings of the independent directors, as the Chairman may deem appropriate; and provide guidance and communication to the Chief Executive Officer in matters of strategic importance. 
Board Meetings and Attendance 
The Board met seven times in 2018. In 2018, all directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served and, actual director attendance at meetings of the Board and committees on which they served averaged 94%. Under Alcoa's Corporate Governance Guidelines, all directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders, and all directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
The following table sets forth the Board committees and the current members of each of the committees:

 The Compensation and Benefits Committee may form, and delegate its authority to, subcommittees and management, when appropriate, including to a  management employee benefits committee that administers certain broad-based employee benefit plans and to the Chief Executive Officer to determine and approve annual incentive and LTI awards for officer employees of the Company as prescribed by the  Compensation and Benefits Committee. Officers do not determine the amount or form of executive or director compensation, although the Chief Executive Officer provides recommendations to the Compensation and Benefits Committee regarding compensation  changes and incentive compensation for the other officers. For more information on the responsibilities and activities of the committee, including its processes for determining executive compensation, see the "Compensation Discussion and  Analysis" section.

[END TABLE]
The Board is actively engaged in overseeing and reviewing the Company's strategic direction and objectives, taking into account (among other considerations) Alcoa's risk profile and exposures. It is management's responsibility to manage risk and bring to the Board's attention the most material risks to the Company. The Board has oversight responsibility for the processes established to report and monitor systems for material risks applicable to the Company. The Board annually reviews Alcoa's enterprise risk management process and receives regular updates on risk exposures. 
The Board, as a whole, has responsibility for risk oversight, including succession planning relating to the Chief Executive Officer and risks relating to the competitive landscape, strategy, business conditions, and capital requirements. The committees of the Board also oversee Alcoa's risk profile and exposures relating to matters within the scope of their authority. The Board regularly receives detailed reports from the committees regarding risk oversight in their areas of responsibility. 
The Audit Committee discusses the Company's risk profile, risk management, and exposure (and Alcoa's policies relating to the same) with management, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors. Such discussions include the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these exposures.

Corporate Governance (continued) 
 The Audit Committee also is charged with oversight of Alcoa's risks relating to cybersecurity, including review of the state of the Company's cybersecurity, emerging cybersecurity developments and threats, and the Company's strategy to mitigate cybersecurity risks. 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee considers risks related to the attraction and retention of talent, the design of compensation programs and incentive arrangements, and the investment management of the Company's principal retirement and savings plans. The Compensation and Benefits Committee periodically reviews Alcoa's incentive structure to avoid encouraging material risk-taking through financial incentives. Based on these determinations, the Company believes that it is not reasonably likely that Alcoa's compensation and benefit plans incentivize undue risk or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Policies and Practices—What We Do—Maintain a Conservative Compensation Risk Profile." 
The Governance and Nominating Committee considers risks related to corporate governance and oversees succession planning for the Board and the appropriate assignment of directors to the Board committees for risk oversight and other areas of responsibilities. 
The Safety, Sustainability and Public Issues Committee considers risks related to the Company's reputation, and risks relating to safety and health, public policy, environmental sustainability, and social issues. 
The Company believes that the Board leadership structure supports its role in risk oversight. There is open communication between management and directors, and all directors are actively involved in the risk oversight function. 
Communications with Directors 
The Board welcomes input and suggestions. Stockholders and other interested parties wishing to contact the Chairman or the non-management directors as a group may do so by sending a written communication to the attention of the Chairman c/o Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. 
To communicate issues or complaints regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, send a written communication to the Audit Committee c/o Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. Alternatively, you may place an anonymous, confidential, toll free call in the United States to Alcoa's Integrity Line at 1-800-346-7319. You may also make reports by web, email, or standard mail. For a listing of web, email and mailing addresses, and of Integrity Line telephone numbers outside the United States, go to www.alcoa.com "—Who We Are—Ethics and Compliance—Integrity Line." See also www.alcoa.com "—Investors—Corporate Governance." 
Communications addressed to the Board or to a Board member are distributed to the Board or to any individual director or directors, as appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication. On behalf of the Board, the Secretary's Office will submit to the Board all communications received, excluding only those items that are not related to Board duties and responsibilities, such as junk mail and mass mailings; product complaints and product inquiries; new product or technology suggestions; job inquiries and resumes; advertisements or solicitations; and surveys. 
Related Person Transactions 
Review, Approval and Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Company has a written Related Person Transaction Approval Policy regarding the review, approval, and ratification of transactions between the Company and related persons. The policy applies to any transaction in which Alcoa or a subsidiary is a participant, where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A related person means any director or executive officer of the Company, any nominee for director, any stockholder known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities, and any immediate family member of any such persons. 
Under this policy, reviews are conducted by management to determine which transactions or relationships should be referred to the Governance and Nominating Committee for consideration. The Governance and Nominating Committee then reviews the material facts and circumstances regarding a transaction and determines whether to approve, ratify, revise, or

Corporate Governance (continued) 
 reject a related person transaction, or to refer it to the full Board or another committee of the Board for consideration. The Related Person Transaction Approval Policy operates in conjunction with other aspects of the Company's compliance program, including its Code of Conduct that requires all directors, officers, and employees to be free from the influence of any conflict of interest when they carry out their duties with respect to the Company. 
The Board has considered the following types of potential related person transactions and pre-approved them under the Related Person Transaction Approval Policy as not presenting material conflicts of interest: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  employment of executive officers (except employment of an executive officer that is an immediate family member of another  executive officer, director, or nominee for director) as long as the executive officer's compensation is reported or would have been reported (if such executive officer was a "named executive officer") under Regulation S-K  Item 402;  
(ii)  director compensation that is required to be reported, and is reported, under a SEC regulation;  
(iii)  any transaction with another entity if a related person's interest arises only from:  
  (a)  such person's position as a director of the other entity; or  
  (b)  The direct or indirect ownership by such person, together with the ownership by his or her immediate family member, of  less than a 10% equity interest in the aggregate of the other entity (other than a partnership); or  
  (c)  both such position as a director and ownership as described in (a) and (b) above; or  
  (d)  such person's position as a limited partner in a partnership in which the person, together with his or her immediate  family member, have an interest of less than 10%, and the related person is not a general partner of, and does not hold another position in, the partnership.  
(iv)  transactions, such as the receipt of dividends, in which all stockholders receive proportional benefits;   
(v)  transactions involving competitive bids;  
(vi)  transactions involving the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges  fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority; and  
(vii)  transactions with a related person involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee  under a trust indenture, or similar services.  
[END TABLE]
Transactions with Related Persons in 2018 
There were no related person transactions in 2018. 
Compensation Matters 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation and Benefits Committee has served as one of our officers or employees at any time. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Board. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Compensation and Benefits Committee. 
Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee directly retained an independent consultant, Pay Governance. Pay Governance provided advice during 2018 as requested by the Compensation and Benefits Committee on the amount and form of certain executive compensation components, including, among other items, advising on executive compensation market practices and trends, insights on executive compensation and relevant SEC and proxy advisory firm developments, and an analysis and review of the compensation plans for executives. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Policies and Practices—What We Do—The Compensation Committee Retains, an Independent Compensation Consultant." The Compensation and Benefits Committee performed its annual assessment of the consultant's independence and found no conflict of interest. In its assessment, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considered, among other matters: that Pay Governance provides no other services to the Company; the amount of fees

 received from the Company by Pay Governance as a percentage of Pay Governance's total revenue; the policies and procedures that Pay Governance has in place to prevent conflicts of interest; any business or personal relationships between the consultant(s) at Pay Governance performing consulting services and any Compensation and Benefits Committee members or any executive officer; and any ownership of Company stock by the consultant(s). In addition to information provided by Pay Governance, the Company utilized broad-based comparative compensation survey data from Willis Towers Watson, which survey data was not customized for the Company (other than to remove insurance and financial service companies), in order to assist the Company with its general understanding as to whether its compensation programs were competitive with the market. 
Recovery of Incentive Compensation 
The Alcoa Corporation 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2016 Stock Incentive Plan"), and the Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "Annual Incentive Plan"), each provide that if the Board learns of (i) any violation of the Company's Code of Conduct or similar codes and/or policies that results in significant financial or reputational harm to the Company, as determined in the Board's sole discretion, then the Board will, to the extent permitted by law, effect the full or partial cancellation or recovery of awards previously granted to a former or current executive officer or (ii) any misconduct by a current or former executive officer that contributed to the Company having to restate all or a portion of its financial statements, then the Board will, to the full extent permitted by governing law, in all appropriate cases, effect the cancellation and recovery of any incentive compensation previously granted to such executive officer if: (A) the amount of the incentive compensation was calculated based upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement, (B) the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement, and (C) the amount of the incentive compensation had the financial results been properly reported would have been lower than the amount actually awarded. Furthermore, all incentive compensation (including incentive compensation that has already vested) is subject to the terms and conditions, if applicable, of any other recoupment policy adopted by the Company from time to time or any recoupment requirement imposed under applicable laws, rules, regulations or stock exchange listing standards.

Beneficial Ownership 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company's common stock and other equity securities with the SEC within specified periods. Due to the complexity of the reporting rules, the Company undertakes to file such reports on behalf of its directors and executive officers and has instituted procedures to assist them with these obligations. Based solely on a review of filings with the SEC and written representations from the Company's directors and executive officers, the Company believes that in 2018 all of its directors and executive officers filed the required reports on a timely basis with respect to Alcoa's equity securities under Section 16(a). 
Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners 
The following table sets forth the number and percentage of shares of our common stock beneficially owned as of December 31, 2018 (unless otherwise noted) by persons we know to be the beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, as reported by such stockholders to the SEC.

Item 2 Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Auditor 
Under its charter, the Audit Committee of the Board has sole authority and is directly responsible for the appointment, retention, compensation, oversight, evaluation, and termination of the independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditors") retained to audit the Company's financial statements. 
The Audit Committee evaluated the qualifications, performance, and independence of the Company's independent auditors, and based on its evaluation, has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent auditors for fiscal year 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as the Company's independent auditors during 2018. The independent auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss audit findings and other financial matters. The Audit Committee believes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is knowledgeable about the Company's operations and accounting practices. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditors is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the approval of the engagement fees and terms associated with the retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Audit Committee considers whether the services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are compatible with maintaining the independence of the Company's independent auditors. In addition to assuring the regular rotation of the lead audit partner as required by law, the Audit Committee is involved in the selection and evaluation of the lead audit partner and considers whether, in order to assure continuing auditor independence, there should be a regular rotation of the independent auditors. 
Although the Bylaws do not require that we seek stockholder ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors, we are doing so as a matter of good corporate governance. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.

Item 2 Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Auditors (continued) 
Report of the Audit Committee 
In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for assisting the Board to fulfill its oversight of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the integrity of the Company's financial statements and internal controls,  
• the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements,  
• the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, and  
• the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors.  
[END TABLE]
It is the responsibility of Alcoa's management to prepare the Company's financial statements and to develop and maintain adequate systems of internal accounting and financial controls. The Company's internal auditors are responsible for conducting internal audits intended to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's financial and operating internal control systems. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 (the independent auditor), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and/or other applicable principles. The independent auditors also review the Company's interim financial statements in accordance with applicable auditing standards. 
In evaluating the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Audit Committee has (i) received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding the audit firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, (ii) discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the firm's independence from the Company and management and (iii) considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditors' independence. In addition, the Audit Committee assures that the lead audit partner is rotated at least every five years in accordance with SEC and PCAOB requirements, and considered whether there should be a regular rotation of the audit firm itself in order to assure the continuing independence of the outside auditors. The Audit Committee has concluded that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is independent from the Company and its management. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed with the independent auditors and the Company's internal auditors the overall scope and specific plans for their respective audits, and the Audit Committee regularly monitors the progress of both in assessing the Company's compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including their findings, required resources, and progress to date. 
At every regular meeting, the Audit Committee meets separately, with the independent auditor and the Company's Vice President—Internal Audit, with and without management present, to review the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's accounting and financial reporting. The Audit Committee also meets separately at its regular meetings with the Chief Financial Officer, the Controller, the General Counsel, and the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. 
The Audit Committee has met and discussed with management and the independent auditors the fair and complete presentation of the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee has also discussed and reviewed with the independent auditors all matters required to be discussed under the rules adopted by the PCAOB. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied in the financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has represented that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with both management and the independent auditors. 
Relying on the foregoing reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has approved, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent auditor for 2019.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approval of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services, and for pre-approval of fee levels for such services. These procedures require that the terms and fees for the annual audit service engagement be approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor's independence. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent auditor has received pre-approval under this policy, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee before the service is provided. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels under the policy will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee before the service is provided. The term of any pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. The Audit Committee will periodically revise the list of pre-approved services, based on subsequent determinations. Under the policy, the Audit Committee has delegated limited pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee; the Chair is required to report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All services set forth in the following table were approved by the Audit Committee before being rendered. 
Auditor Fees

Item 3 Advisory Vote to Approve 2018 Named Executive Officer Compensation 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Board is asking you to approve, on an advisory basis, the executive compensation programs and policies and the resulting 2018 compensation of the NEOs listed in the "Summary Compensation Table" in this Proxy Statement, commonly referred to as the "Say on Pay" vote. At the 2017 Annual Meeting, stockholders voted to hold an advisory "Say on Pay" vote on an annual basis. Accordingly, Alcoa has determined to submit an annual advisory vote on our executive compensation program to our stockholders at each annual meeting until the Company seeks another advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation, which is anticipated to occur at the 2023 Annual Meeting. 
The Say on Pay vote is advisory; therefore, the result will not be binding on the Company, the Board, or the Compensation and Benefits Committee and it will not affect, limit or augment any existing compensation or awards. The Compensation and Benefits Committee will, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation arrangements. In 2018, our Say on Pay proposal received support from approximately 96% of the shares voted at our Annual Meeting. 
You should read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and the compensation tables in determining whether to approve this proposal. 
The Board recommends that the stockholders approve the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.

Executive Compensation 
Summary 
In 2018, we focused our efforts on strengthening our Company to deliver on our strategic priorities and building on our position as a global leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products through all market cycles. 
The compensation programs described below in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") have been developed by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of Alcoa (for purposes of this section, the "Compensation Committee" or the "Committee"). Certain compensation programs were developed by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the board of directors of Alcoa Inc. (subsequently renamed Arconic Inc., the "Arconic Compensation Committee") prior to Separation and subsequently retained by the Company following review by our Compensation Committee. 
Overview of 2018 Performance-Based Compensation 
In early 2018, the Committee undertook an evaluation of our pay-for-performance practices with the goals of motivating our executive leadership team and strengthening stockholder alignment, while ensuring that unnecessary risk was appropriately mitigated within our pay programs. The result of this evaluation included the following with respect to our 2018 compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee continues to review the compensation elements of our NEOs relative to similarly situated officers in their  respective peer groups and to align those components based on the experience and contributions of each NEO.  
• Our annual IC plan had several design changes: (i) addition of Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items (not normalized)  as further described below, which better aligns our IC payout with the market experience of our stockholders; (ii) weighting financial measures at 70% and non-financial measures at 30% (from 80% and 20%, respectively, for 2017) to reinforce the  importance of safety to the Company; (iii) increase of the Safety and Environmental metric weighting from 10% to 20%, further emphasizing the importance of the environment and focusing the organization on several safety initiatives launched in  2018; and (iv) elimination of the individual multiplier (however, the Committee continues to evaluate NEO individual contributions when determining IC payouts).  
• Maintaining the equity mix for our NEOs at 60% performance-based restricted share units ("PRSUs") (at target), 20%  stock options, and 20% time-based restricted share units ("RSUs").  
• For the PRSUs granted in 2018, establishing a three-year cumulative performance cycle from January 1, 2018 through  December 31, 2020 that maintains equally-weighted performance metrics of return on capital ("ROC") improvement and TSR (relative to the S&P 500 Index); we continue to believe that these metrics strengthen the alignment between  executives' and stockholders' interests.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Committee established performance metrics and targets for both the 2018 IC under our Annual Incentive Plan and the 2018 tranche of the PRSU awards granted in 2016 by the Arconic Compensation Committee (the "legacy Arconic PRSU awards"), which were each measured over the one-year period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The Company assumed the legacy Arconic PRSU awards at the time of the Separation. 
The Compensation Committee believes that we have very strong pay for performance alignment with stockholders. While we made great strategic progress, and achieved certain targets, we did not achieve all of them. As a result, our overall metric performance under the 2018 IC was at 63.5% of target, and we had below target performance as to the 2018 tranche of the legacy Arconic PRSUs granted in 2016. The 2016 legacy Arconic PRSU awards vested with an aggregate pay-out of either 35.7% or 38.3% of target, depending on the NEO's associated legacy Arconic business unit. 
With respect to the legacy Arconic PRSU awards, the 2018 tranche of the 2016 PRSU award value is computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and included in the 2018 row of the "Stock Awards" column of the SCT. The performance goals under the legacy 2016 PRSU awards were established annually for each tranche, and therefore the 2018 tranche is included in addition to the grant date fair value of the 2018 PRSU awards, which have a three-year performance period. 2018 represents the final tranche of the legacy PRSUs, as all performance periods for legacy Arconic PRSU awards have been completed.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This CD&A describes Alcoa's executive compensation philosophy and the pay programs applicable to the below-referenced NEOs in 2018. 
The 2018 NEOs are comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), and the next three most highly compensated executive officers of Alcoa (other than the CEO and CFO) at December 31, 2018. A 6th NEO is included, Tómas M. Sigurðsson, who assumed a new role with Alcoa effective November 1, 2018 as Senior Vice President, Strategic Alliances and, as such, is no longer an executive officer for SEC purposes. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Roy C. Harvey, President and CEO  
• William F. Oplinger, Executive Vice President and CFO  
• Jeffrey D. Heeter, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary  
• Leigh Ann Fisher, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer  
• Timothy D. Reyes, Executive Vice President and President Aluminum  
• Tómas M. Sigurðsson, Senior Vice President, Strategic Alliances  
[END TABLE]
This CD&A is organized as follows: (i) Executive Compensation Philosophy; (ii) Executive Compensation Policies and Practices; (iii) Stockholder Engagement and 2018 Say-on-Pay vote; (iv) Executive Compensation Process and 2018 Executive Compensation; (v) Section 162(m); (vi) Other Compensation Plans and Arrangements of Alcoa; and (vii) Double-Trigger Termination and Change in Control Terms in Annual Incentive and LTI Awards. 
Executive Compensation Philosophy 
Our executive compensation philosophy is based on three guiding principles to drive pay-for-performance and alignment of the compensation program with the interests of our stockholders: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Target total compensation at the median of market, while using the annual and long-term equity incentive plans to reward  exceptional performance and attract and retain exceptional talent. The Committee seeks to maintain a competitive level and mix of pay reflective of the market in which we compete for talent. We do this by reviewing the levels and mix of compensation  paid to executive officers in similar positions within our peer group. The Committee reviews each NEO's compensation relative not only to their respective peer group but also based on their contributions to Alcoa.  
  2.  Ensure that equity is the most significant portion of total compensation for NEOs, which aligns our NEOs' interests  with those of our stockholders.  
  3.  Choose annual and LTI metrics that focus management's actions on achieving the greatest possible positive impact on  financial performance, without creating undue risk.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee used its experience and business judgment to determine the appropriate compensation metrics, targets, and awards for our executive officers, including the NEOs, in 2018. As part of this determination, the Committee assessed numerous factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Individual, business unit, and corporate performance;  
• Market positioning, based on peer group data, targeting the market median;  
• Complexity and importance of each NEO's role and his or her related responsibilities;  
• Aggressiveness of the performance targets;  
• Unanticipated events impacting financial results;  
• Retention of key individuals in a competitive talent market; and  
• Leadership and growth potential.  
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation philosophy is reviewed annually and refined by the Committee to align with our strategic priorities, corporate values, business needs, stockholder value, and peer group practices.

Executive Compensation Policies and Practices 
Our executive compensation programs, policies, and practices are highlighted below. 
What We Do 
Pay for Performance. We believe in a "pay for performance" philosophy that links executive compensation to measured performance in key financial and non-financial areas, as well as the long-term interests of stockholders. For purposes of short-term compensation, the Company evaluated performance against rigorous business metrics to incentivize performance, including with respect to free cash flow, EBITDA, safety and diversity. With respect to LTI awards, the Committee chose ROC improvement and relative TSR as the performance metrics, measured over a three-year period, in support of our strategic priority to drive returns to stockholders. In certain instances, we normalize for market factors, as further described in this CD&A. 
Consider Peer Groups in Establishing Compensation. To help determine 2018 total direct compensation for our NEOs, the Committee developed and approved the use of two peer groups: one for our CEO (the "CEO Peer Group"), which consists of 16 companies (and also is used as a secondary peer group for our other NEOs), and a second group, consisting of over 250 companies, for our other NEOs (the "Non-CEO Peer Group"). The CEO Peer Group was determined primarily based upon Global Industry Classification Standards, revenue, and market capitalization. The Non-CEO Peer Group was based primarily upon revenue, and is limited to companies who also participated in the Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Survey, excluding financial services and insurance companies. The component companies for the CEO Peer Group are listed below. 
Review Tally Sheets. For 2018, the Committee utilized and reviewed tally sheets that summarized various elements of historic and current compensation for the CEO and other NEOs, which helped the Committee synthesize the various components of the 2018 executive compensation program. This information included compensation opportunities, actual compensation, and historical awards. 
Maintain Robust Stock Ownership Guidelines. Alcoa maintains stock ownership requirements that align the interests of management with those of stockholders by requiring executives to hold substantial equity in Alcoa until retirement. Our stock ownership guidelines require that the CEO and each of the other NEOs retain equity equal in value to a multiple of their base salaries, as shown below. All of our NEOs satisfied their stock ownership requirements as of December 31, 2018, with the exception of our CEO, who only became our CEO at the time of the Separation in November 2016. These guidelines reinforce management's focus on long-term stockholder value, their commitment to Alcoa, and require a meaningful level of ownership for all NEOs. Until stock ownership requirements are met, each NEO is required to retain 50% of any shares acquired upon the vesting of RSUs/restricted stock (time or performance based) or upon exercise of stock options. For purposes of satisfying this requirement, "shares" include shares of Alcoa Common Stock owned outright by the NEO, units in the Alcoa Retirement Savings Plan or Deferred Compensation Plan, and unvested time-based RSUs. The "Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers" table on page 38 includes stock options, which do not count toward satisfying the stock ownership requirements until vested and exercised. The Committee continues to monitor the NEOs' progression and achievement of their respective stock ownership requirements.

[END TABLE]
Schedule Equity Award Grants to Promote Transparency and Consistency. Alcoa's practice has been to grant equity awards on the same day as its first Committee meeting each year, typically held in January or February, with an exercise price for stock options based on the closing market price per share of Alcoa stock on the grant date. 
Clawback Policies Incorporated into Incentive Plans. Alcoa's Annual Incentive Plan and 2016 Stock Incentive Plan each contain "clawback" provisions regarding recoupment of compensation. In 2018, amendments to the Annual Incentive Plan and the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan were approved that further enhanced the plans' already robust recoupment features to provide that if the Board learns of any violation of the Company's Code of Conduct or similar codes and/or policies that results in significant financial or reputational harm to Alcoa, as determined in the Board's discretion, then the Board may cause the full or partial cancellation and recovery of awards previously granted to any current or former executive officer. 
Double-Trigger Equity Vesting in the Event of a Change in Control. Double-trigger vesting generally means that if outstanding awards under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan are replaced by the acquirer or related entity in a change in control of Alcoa, those replacement awards will not immediately vest on a "single trigger" basis. Vesting would accelerate only if the participant is terminated without "cause" or resigns for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the Alcoa Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan) within 24 months following the change in control. Performance-based stock awards will be converted to time-vested stock awards upon a change in control and, similarly, would be subject to the same double-trigger vesting provisions. 
Pay Competitive Salaries. The Committee reviewed and set the 2018 salaries of its executive officers, including the NEOs, after consideration of the median of the peer group for their respective positions, individual contributions, previous salary changes, experience, and other factors. 
Provide Appropriate Benefits. Our NEOs participate in the same benefit plans as our salaried employees for their respective countries. We provide retirement and benefit plans to senior executives for the same reasons as for other employees—to provide a competitive compensation package that offers an opportunity for retirement, savings, and health and welfare benefits. Retirement plans for senior executives generally pay the same formula amount as retirement plans for salaried employees. 
Maintain a Conservative Compensation Risk Profile. We review our compensation risk profile on an annual basis. The Committee periodically evaluates the risk profile of our compensation programs and when establishing policies and approving annual and LTI plan designs. Additionally, the Board annually considers risks related to compensation in its oversight of enterprise risk management. These evaluations include a consideration of the ways in which we believe compensation risk is effectively managed or mitigated, including as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The use of corporate-wide metrics encourages cooperation between businesses by focusing on the same goals;   
• The mix between short-term and long-term incentives, and balance between cash and equity programs;  
• Caps on incentives;  
• Use of multiple financial and nonfinancial performance measures in our incentive plans;  
• Discretion retained by the Committee to adjust awards;  
• Stock ownership guidelines requiring holding substantial equity in Alcoa until retirement;  
• Clawback policies applicable to all forms of annual and LTI compensation;  
• Anti-hedging and anti-pledging provisions in the insider trading policy; and  
• Restricting stock option awards to 20% of the overall value of equity awards to NEOs.

Executive Compensation | Compensation Discussion and Analysis | Executive Compensation Policies and Practices (continued) 
The Compensation Committee Retains an Independent Compensation Consultant. In 2018, the Committee directly retained an independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, that provided advice as requested by the Committee on the amount and form of certain executive compensation, including, among other items, executive compensation best practices, insights concerning SEC and say-on-pay developments, and analysis and review of Alcoa's compensation plans for executives. The independent consultant did not provide any services to Alcoa other than the services provided directly to the Committee. Alcoa utilized broad-based comparative compensation survey data from Willis Towers Watson, which was not customized for Alcoa (other than to remove insurance and financial services companies), to assist with its general understanding as to whether its compensation programs were competitive with the market. 
What We Don't Do 
No Employment Contracts. We do not have employment contracts with any of our NEOs. 
No Short Selling, Hedging or Pledging of Alcoa Stock. Short sales of Alcoa securities (i.e., sales of securities that are not then owned) and derivative or speculative transactions, including puts and calls, in Alcoa securities by our directors, officers and employees are prohibited. No director, officer or employee or any designee of such director, officer or employee is permitted to purchase or use financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Alcoa securities. Directors and officers are prohibited from holding Alcoa securities in margin accounts and from pledging Alcoa securities as collateral. 
No Excise Tax Gross-Ups for Participants in the Change in Control Severance Plan. The Change in Control Severance Plan provides that no excise or other tax gross-ups will be paid, and that severance benefits will be available only upon termination of employment for "good reason" by an officer or without cause by Alcoa. For a discussion of the Alcoa Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan, see "Other Compensation Plans and Arrangements of Alcoa" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
No Significant Perquisites. Consistent with our executive compensation philosophy, we limit the perquisites provided to executive officers to business-related relocation and international assignments that serve reasonable business purposes. 
Limited Tax Gross-Ups Reserved for Certain Critical Business-Related Purposes. Alcoa does not provide our NEOs with tax gross-ups or reimbursements on perquisites, other than in limited circumstances for business-related relocation and international assignments which are deemed to be in the best interests of the Company to retain our executive talent, and are consistent with market practice. 
No Dividend Equivalents on Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, and No Payment of Dividend Equivalents on Unvested Stock Awards. Alcoa currently does not pay a regular dividend. If and to the extent that we determine to pay dividends in the future, dividend equivalents would be accrued and paid on certain awards only if and when such awards vest. Such dividend equivalents would be calculated at the same rate as any dividends paid on our common stock. Dividend equivalents would not be paid on stock options or stock appreciation rights. Alcoa paid accrued dividends (prior to Separation) in 2018 associated with the 2015 legacy LTI awards from Arconic. 
No Discounting of Stock Options or Repricing of Underwater Stock Options (including cash-outs). The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan prohibits the discounting and the repricing of stock options, including cash-outs, without stockholder approval. 
Stockholder Engagement and 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote 
Routine and consistent investor outreach is fundamental to our commitment to engagement, communication, and transparency with our stockholders. Throughout the year, we proactively maintain relationships with our largest institutional stockholders, representing over 50% of our outstanding shares, and make efforts to be in contact with as many stockholders as possible, to solicit feedback and ensure our Board and management have insight into the issues that are most important to our stockholders. For example, in 2018, we incorporated stockholder feedback into the development of our capital allocation program that we executed in 2018 and have further developed for longer-term strategy.

Executive Compensation | Compensation Discussion and Analysis | Stockholder Engagement and 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote (continued) 
Stockholders have expressed support for Alcoa's compensation programs, as evidenced by our 2018 Say-on-Pay vote (approximately 96% of the votes cast were in favor of the proposal). In addition, stockholders have provided positive feedback to us on our use of the ROC improvement and relative TSR metrics in our LTI program. As a result, the Committee did not make any substantial changes to Alcoa's compensation programs for 2019. Additionally, the Committee will consider stockholder input, including the advisory Say-on-Pay vote, as it evaluates the design of executive compensation programs and specific compensation decisions for executive officers in the future. We communicate with our stockholders through various methods, all of which are designed to keep stockholders apprised of the Company's operations, including through participation in numerous investor conferences, and maintain consistent contact with investors throughout every quarter. 
Executive Compensation Process and 2018 Executive Compensation 
The Committee followed the process illustrated below in determining the CEO's and other NEOs' compensation for 2018: 
To attract, motivate, align, and retain high performing executives, we designed our executive compensation program to target total compensation at the median of market, while providing cash and equity incentives that motivate exceptional performance. 
Since demanding leadership challenges continue to confront the aluminum industry, the potential of an above target award of annual IC and LTI compensation is a proven, major retention factor, with a demonstrable impact on motivating managers to achieve strong operational and financial performance. While the reduced payout slope from target to minimum generally is steep, Alcoa also established payout multiples for overachievement that can be earned only with significant upside performance. 
Alcoa designed its 2018 executive compensation program to pay for performance, with equity as the most significant portion of total compensation. As with last year, the Committee approved weighting performance-based incentives commensurate with each NEO's level of responsibility. For 2018, 91% of our CEO's target compensation and 77% to 83% of our other NEOs' target compensation was incentive, performance-based and/or at-risk, with the remaining amounts in the form of base salary. 
We established performance metrics and targets at the beginning of 2018 for the Annual Incentive Plan, the 2018 tranche of the legacy Arconic PRSU awards granted in 2016, and our 2018 three-year cumulative PRSU program.

2018 Base Salaries 
Each NEO's base salary was reviewed in early 2018 with the following primary considerations: experience in the position, the median of the peer group for their respective positions, and individual contributions. Alcoa pays salaries to its NEOs to ensure an appropriate level of fixed compensation that enables the attraction and retention of highly skilled executives and mitigates the incentive to assume highly risky business strategies to maximize annual cash incentive compensation. The base salaries for our CEO and other NEOs were reviewed at the beginning of 2018. In an effort to link the NEOs' base salaries more closely with the market median, the Committee adjusted each NEO's base salary, as reflected in the below table. In particular, the 2017 base salaries for Messrs. Sigurðsson and Heeter and for Ms. Fisher were found to be below the market median. The 2018 base salaries were increased for all NEOs to more closely approximate market median for their respective positions.

2018 Annual Incentive Compensation 
Our IC plan had several design changes for 2018 as follows: (i) addition of Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items (not normalized) as further described below, which better aligns our IC payout with the experience of our stockholders, (ii) weighting financial measures at 70% and non-financial measures at 30% (from 80% and 20%, respectively, for 2017) to reinforce the importance of safety to the Company; (iii) increase of the Safety and Environmental metric weighting from 10% to 20%, further emphasizing the importance of the environment and focusing the organization on several safety initiatives launched in 2018, and (iv) elimination of the individual multiplier (however, the Committee continues to evaluate NEO individual contributions when determining IC payouts). 
We based annual cash incentive opportunities for 2018 on the following parameters plus the individual goals and contributions of each NEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 70% financial targets, based upon free cash flow (25%) and adjusted EBITDA excluding special items (25%),  both normalized, and adjusted EBITDA excluding special items not normalized (20%) metrics, as more fully described below; and  
• 30% non-financial targets, consisting of safety and GHG emission reductions (20%) and diversity  (10%) metrics, each as more fully described below.

Additional Information Regarding Financial Metrics 
For incentive compensation purposes, the Company's metrics for Free Cash Flow-normalized and Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items-normalized are calculated by taking Alcoa's Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA (which are derived from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements), normalizing such metrics for certain factors not in management's control, and adjusting such metrics to exclude special items. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Attachment A for further discussion of the financial metrics as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
With respect to the normalized measures of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items, we normalize for aluminum (including premiums) and alumina pricing and currency exchange rates, each of which may have significant effects on financial results and are not impacted by management performance or otherwise within management's control. For 2018, we also normalized for raw material costs for similar reasons. Additionally, we adjust for certain items deemed to be special items to the Company's financial results. A description of the normalization and adjustment of these factors follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• London Metal Exchange ("LME") Pricing and Alumina Pricing Index ("API"): Without  normalization, in years when the LME price of aluminum, or the price of alumina through the API, rises rapidly relative to plan (i.e., our forecasts), annual incentive compensation would be less effective as a performance incentive because  management would receive an unearned benefit. Conversely, when LME and API prices for aluminum and alumina, respectively, fall dramatically relative to our plan, failure to normalize would demotivate employees by placing annual incentive  compensation awards out of reach for reasons beyond their control. Our use of normalization enables us to drive operational and financial performance, particularly in recent years of volatile prices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Currency Exchange Rates: Since our revenues are largely U.S. dollar-denominated, while costs in non-U.S. locations  are largely denominated in local currency, the volatility of currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on earnings. As our commodities are traded in U.S. dollars, we typically have seen an inverse correlation to foreign currency  exchange. Therefore, to avoid double counting, the normalization for the commodity price swings needs to be corrected by concurrent normalization of foreign exchange.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Premiums: In addition to LME, API, and foreign currency normalization, results historically have been adjusted to  neutralize 50% of the fluctuations in regional aluminum premiums compared to plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Raw Materials: For 2018, results were normalized to neutralize 100% of the fluctuations in raw material costs  compared to the plan. Similar to LME and API, when raw material costs rise rapidly relative to plan, failure to normalize would demotivate employees by placing annual incentive compensation awards out of reach for reasons beyond their control.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Special Items: Special item adjustments may be recommended to the Board for approval, such as restructuring programs,  discretionary pension funding, and one-time production disruption events.  
[END TABLE]
Because we generally do not hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or LME and API prices, normalization adjustments for LME, API, currency exchange rates, 50% of regional premiums, and raw material prices were made relative to the Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items metrics used in determining the 2018 IC awards.

2018 Target Annual Incentive Compensation Opportunities 
In February 2018, the IC plan was reviewed, and it was determined the individual multipliers that have been historically applied were not common practice and therefore removed from the plan design. The following target incentive opportunities were set and approved by the Committee for each NEO based on his or her then-current job band and aligned with the median of applicable peer group market data.

2018 Grants of Long-Term Incentive Awards to Each NEO 
In January 2018, the Committee performed a qualitative review of each NEO's performance, with specific review and emphasis upon their respective roles and contributions to the Company during the year, as well as a quantitative review of peer group median market compensation data. In light of each NEO's critical role in the achievement of Company goals and performance of each NEO throughout 2017 (which included the application of their respective individual performance multipliers used for their 2017 IC payouts to their target LTI dollar amounts), the Committee granted the following 2018 LTI awards for each NEO (based on the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on the grant date):

Although the Committee structured certain performance-based awards in a manner intended to be exempt from Section 162(m), and therefore not subject to its deduction limits, because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing the performance-based compensation exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m), in fact, will. The Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards may result in non-deductible compensation expenses.

Under the CIC Severance Plan, an eligible employee who incurs a qualifying termination of employment, which is generally a termination without cause or resignation for good reason within two years following a change in control, will generally be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• cash severance equal to three times, in the case of the CEO, CFO and General Counsel, and two times, in the case of other  participants, the sum of the employee's annual base salary and his or her target incentive compensation with respect to the year of the change in control;  
• a pro-rated annual bonus;  
• continued life, accident and health benefits for up to three years, in the case of the CEO, CFO and General Counsel, and up  to two years, in the case of other participants, following the qualifying termination of employment;  
• a cash lump sum amount representing the estimated equivalent of three years, in the case of the CEO, CFO and General  Counsel, and two years, in the case of other participants, of Alcoa contributions to the Alcoa defined contribution plans in which the employee participates;  
• a cash lump sum amount representing the estimated incremental increase in defined benefit plan accrual or Employer  Retirement Income Contributions (ERIC) that would have been accrued on behalf of the employee during the three years, in the case of the CEO, CFO and General Counsel, and two years, in the case of other participants, following the qualifying  termination under the Alcoa defined benefit plans in which the employee participates, if any; and  
• reasonable outplacement services for a period of up to six months.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the eligible employee will be entitled to receive benefits under Alcoa's post-retirement health care if the employee would have become entitled to benefits under this plan had he or she remained employed during the three years, in the case of the CEO, CFO and General Counsel, and two years in the case of other participants, following the qualifying termination. If amounts payable to an officer under the CIC Severance Plan would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), such amounts will be reduced if necessary to maximize the after-tax payment to the officer. 
Severance Agreements 
Severance agreements were entered into by and between Alcoa and each of the CEO and CFO (together, the "CEO/CFO Severance Agreements") and other NEOs (collectively, the "Officer Severance Agreements"), for the purpose of providing severance benefits to such officers upon a qualifying termination of employment that occurs other than in connection with a change in control. Payment is generally contingent upon the officer's execution of a release of claims. 
Under the CEO/CFO Severance Agreements, the officer will receive a payment of $50,000 upon a voluntary resignation where such officer provides three months' notice to Alcoa contingent upon a release of claims. Upon an involuntary termination without cause, such officer is generally entitled to receive (i) cash severance equal to two times the officer's annual base salary, (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, (iii) $50,000 in consideration of execution of a release of claims, (iv) continued health benefits for two years following termination, and (v) a cash lump sum amount designed to provide two years of additional pension or retirement benefits under the Company defined benefit plans or, as applicable, defined contribution plans in which the officer participates. 
Under the Officer Severance Agreements, upon an involuntary termination of the officer's employment without cause, the officer is generally entitled to receive (i) cash severance equal to the officer's annual base salary, (ii) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, (iii) continued health benefits for one year following termination, and (iv) either one year of additional accrual under the Alcoa defined benefit plans or a lump sum amount equal to ERIC (or equivalent non-U.S. benefit) for one year.

Alcoa Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the Alcoa USA Corp. Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may defer base salary amounts and certain incentive plan awards until a later date. Generally, earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation include returns on notional investments that mirror the investment alternatives available to all salaried employees under the Alcoa Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees. 
Double-Trigger Termination and Change in Control Terms in Annual Incentive and LTI Awards 
Change in Control Provisions in the Annual Incentive Plan 
In the event of a change in control, officers and other key employees receiving compensation pursuant to the Annual Incentive Plan, at the discretion of the Committee, are paid a pro-rata portion of target incentive compensation for the calendar year for which awards were made, based on the days of service during such calendar year from the beginning of the calendar year through the date of the change in control. 
Change in Control Provisions in the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan 
The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan provides for double-trigger equity vesting in the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan). This generally means that if outstanding awards under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan are replaced by the acquirer or related entity in a change in control of Alcoa, those replacement awards will not immediately vest on a "single trigger" basis, but vesting would accelerate only if the participant is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (as those terms are defined in the CIC Severance Plan) within 24 months following the change in control.

Executive Compensation (continued) 
Summary Compensation Table 
The following table sets forth information concerning the compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to, our NEOs for the years indicated below. 
In reviewing the amounts shown in the 2018 row of the table for each NEO, please note that the reported values in the "Stock Awards," and "Total" columns for the 2017 and 2018 rows of the table also include the legacy Arconic 2016 PRSU awards. This is due to SEC rules requiring that the values included in the "Stock Awards" column below be determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718, which mandates that Alcoa include not only the aggregate grant date accounting fair value of the 2018 PRSU grants (with a three-year cumulative performance period) and time-based RSUs awarded by the Committee in January 2018, but also for each applicable NEO, the aggregate grant date accounting fair value of the 2018 one-year tranche of the legacy Arconic 2016 PRSU awards for which annual performance goals were set at the commencement of the year in the three-year performance period (for the 2018 tranche, by the Committee in January 2018).

Executive Compensation (continued) 
The present value calculations are based on Alcoa specific mortality assumptions and discount rates of 4.34% for the Pension Plan for Certain Salaried Employees of Alcoa USA Corp. and 4.40% for the Alcoa USA Corp. Nonqualified Supplemental Retirement Plan. 
Qualified Defined Benefit Plan. Effective August 1, 2016, in anticipation of Separation, Arconic spun off certain assets and liabilities from Alcoa Retirement Plan I (the "Predecessor Retirement Plan") attributable to employees, including Messrs. Harvey, Oplinger, Heeter, Reyes and Ms. Fisher, to form the Pension Plan for Certain Salaried Employees of Alcoa USA Corp. (the "Plan"). The Plan is intended as a continuation of the Predecessor Retirement Plan for the participants covered by the Plan and recognizes elections and retirements under the Predecessor Retirement Plan for affected employees and former employees. The Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers a majority of U.S. salaried employees hired before March 1, 2006. Benefits under the plan are based upon years of service and Average Final Compensation. Average Final Compensation includes salary plus 100% of annual cash incentive compensation. The Plan reflects the compensation limit imposed by the Code, which was $275,000 for 2018. The base benefit payable at age 65 is 1.1% of Average Final Compensation up to the Social Security Covered Compensation plus 1.475% of Average Final Compensation above the Social Security Covered Compensation, times years of service. No further benefits will accrue under the Plan after the freeze date of December 31, 2020. Service for determining retirement eligibility will be unaffected. Early retirement benefits are available for employees covered by Rule IC or Rule IM (each as explained below) who leave the Company at age 55 with 10 or more years of service, however benefits are reduced from age 62 (Rule IC) or age 65 (Rule IM) based on age at commencement. Effective January 1, 2018, participants accruing service on or after January 1, 2018 have a lump sum form of payment available along with all other existing forms of payment (single life, 50% joint and survivor, and 75% joint and survivor monthly annuities, as applicable). The lump sum form of payment is not available to disability retirements or other restricted retirement types. For Rule IC participants who retire prior to age 62 with 30 or more years of service, the benefit payable until age 62 is determined by a different formula of 1.5% of Average Final Compensation up to $100,000, plus 1% of Average Final Compensation above $100,000, multiplied by service. This benefit payable until age 62 is not reduced for early commencement. Average Final Compensation is calculated using the average of the highest five of the last ten years of earnings, in the case of Messrs. Heeter and Reyes and Ms. Fisher, and the average of the highest consecutive five of the last ten years of earnings for Messrs. Harvey and Oplinger. 
Nonqualified Defined Benefit Plans. Effective August 1, 2016, in anticipation of Separation, Arconic separated the Alcoa Inc. Employees' Excess Benefits Plan C (the "Predecessor Excess Benefit Plan") into two separate plans: the Alcoa USA Corp. Nonqualified Supplemental Retirement Plan C and the Predecessor Excess Benefit Plan (renamed Arconic Employees' Excess Benefits Plan C). Alcoa USA Corp. has adopted and is the sponsor of the Alcoa USA Corp. Nonqualified Supplemental Retirement Plan C (this "Non-Qualified Pension Plan") effective August 1, 2016. This Non-Qualified Pension Plan is intended as a continuation of the Predecessor Excess Benefit Plan for the participants covered by this Non-Qualified Pension Plan and recognizes retirements and service accrued under the Predecessor Excess Benefit Plan for affected employees and former employees. 
In 2018, Messrs. Harvey, Oplinger, Heeter and Reyes and Ms. Fisher participated in the Non-Qualified Pension Plan. This plan is a nonqualified plan which provides for benefits that exceed the limits on compensation imposed by the Code. The benefit formula is identical to the Pension Plan for Certain Salaried Employees of Alcoa USA Corp formula and no further benefits will accrue under the Plan after December 31, 2020. Benefits under the nonqualified plan are payable as a reduced 50% joint and survivor annuity if the executive is married. Otherwise, the benefit is payable as a single life annuity.

[END TABLE]
The principal benefit to the NEOs of the Alcoa USA Corp. Deferred Compensation Plan is that United States taxes are deferred until the deferred amount and credited earnings are withdrawn, so that savings accumulate on a pretax basis. Alcoa also benefits from this arrangement because it does not use its cash to pay the deferred salaries or incentive compensation of the individuals who have deferred receipt of these amounts. Alcoa may use this cash for other purposes until the deferred account is paid to the individual upon termination of employment. All nonqualified pension and deferred compensation are general unsecured assets of Alcoa until paid. Upon termination of employment, deferred compensation will be paid in cash as a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments, depending on the individual's election, account balance and retirement eligibility. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Except as otherwise provided, the following narrative and tables set forth the potential payments and the value of other additional benefits that would vest or otherwise accelerate vesting at, following, or in connection with any termination, including without limitation, resignation, retirement or a constructive termination of an NEO, or a "change in control" of Alcoa, or a change in the NEOs' responsibilities, as such scenarios are contemplated in the contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements described below. 
The tables assume that employment termination and/or the change in control occurred on December 31, 2018 and a valuation of our common stock based on its closing market price per share on December 31, 2018 of $26.58. The tables

Executive Compensation (continued) 
 also assume that each executive will take all action necessary or appropriate for such person to receive the maximum available benefit, such as execution of a release of claims and compliance with restrictive covenants described below. Actual amounts payable can only be determined at the time of such NEO's separation from the Company. 
A description of some elements of the plans, arrangements and agreements covered by the following tables and which provide for payments or benefits in connection with a termination of employment or change in control are also described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." The footnotes to the tables describe the assumptions that were used in calculating the amounts described below. 
Potential Payments upon a Change in Control. 
Alcoa maintains the CIC Severance Plan, which is designed to retain eligible key executives designated by the Compensation Committee during the period when a transaction is being negotiated, or during a period in which a hostile takeover is being attempted, and to ensure the impartiality of the key negotiators for Alcoa. 
The CIC Severance Plan provides participating officers with severance compensation if their employment is terminated without cause or if they leave for good reason, in either case within two years after a change in control of Alcoa, or in certain limited circumstances prior to a change in control. 
Under the CIC Severance Plan, a "change in control" is defined as: 
In general, the CIC Severance Plan provides for the payment of severance benefits if a change in control occurs, and within two years thereafter either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  The Company terminates the executive's employment with the Company without "cause," which is defined to  mean intentional failure to perform stated duties after 30 days' notice to cure, or willful engagement in conduct materially injurious to the Company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  The executive terminates employment with the Company for "good reason," which is defined to mean:   
[END TABLE]
The CIC Severance Plan provides a higher level of benefits for Alcoa's CEO, CFO and General Counsel than for other participating officers as a result of the Committee's determination of the importance of these roles in the event of a potential change in control transaction. As a result, in the event of a qualifying termination, Messrs. Harvey, Oplinger and Heeter would receive a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of annual base salary plus target annual cash incentive compensation; continuation of life, accident, and health care benefits for up to three years; and lump sum amounts designed to provide three additional years of Alcoa contributions to the defined contribution plans in which they participate and three additional years of defined benefit plan accrual if applicable. Due to the previously announced pension plans' freeze effective December 31, 2020, Messrs. Harvey, Oplinger and Heeter would receive two years of defined benefit accrual under the defined benefit plan plus one-year ERIC to the applicable defined contribution plan. ERIC is an employer contribution amount equal to 3% of salary and annual incentive compensation. All other participating officers, including Mr. Reyes and Ms. Fisher, would receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of their annual base salary plus target annual cash incentive compensation; continuation of life, accident, and health care benefits for up to two years; and lump sum amounts designed to provide two additional years of Alcoa contributions to the defined

Executive Compensation (continued) 
 contribution plans in which they participate, and for Mr. Reyes and Ms. Fisher, two additional years of defined benefit plan accrual. In addition, under the plan, all participating NEOs would receive a pro-rated target annual bonus for the year in which the change control occurs and up to six months of outplacement services. The plan does not provide any participant with reimbursement of excise taxes. 
The amounts shown in the table below include the estimated net present value of accelerated vesting of stock options and stock awards for all participating NEOs. Awards do not have automatic vesting upon a change in control if a replacement award is provided by the successor entity, but such replacement awards would vest upon termination of an officer's employment without cause or if the officer leaves for good reason, in either case within two years after a change in control. Values presented in the tables below assume that both a change in control and a qualifying termination occurred for each participating NEO on December 31, 2018. The estimated value of accelerated vesting of stock awards is calculated based on the closing price per share of Alcoa's common stock on December 31, 2018, which was $26.58, and assumes that PRSU awards vest at the target level. 
Executive Severance Agreements. Alcoa has entered into severance agreements with certain executives, including each of its NEOs, to facilitate transitioning of key positions to suit the timing needs of Alcoa. 
The severance agreements with Messrs. Harvey and Oplinger provide that, if their employment is terminated without cause, they would receive a lump sum amount equivalent to two years' base salary; a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, calculated based on achievement of applicable goals; continued health care benefits for a two-year period; and a lump sum amount designed to provide two additional years of pension accrual under Alcoa's defined benefit plan. In the case of an involuntary termination without cause, or a voluntary termination where they provide three months' notice to Alcoa, Messrs. Harvey and Oplinger would also receive a lump sum severance payment of $50,000 upon execution of a general release of legal claims against Alcoa. No payments would be made under the agreement unless a general release is signed. The agreement requires Messrs. Harvey and Oplinger to comply with two-year non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, as well as confidentiality obligations. 
The severance agreements with Messrs. Heeter, Reyes, and Sigurðsson, and Ms. Fisher, provide that, if their employment is terminated without cause, they would receive a lump sum amount equivalent to one year's base salary; a pro-rated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, calculated based on achievement of applicable goals; continued health benefits for one year following termination; and either credit for one year of additional accrual under the defined benefit plan or, in the case of Mr. Sigurðsson, a lump sum amount equal to Alcoa's contribution to the defined contribution plan in which he participates for one year. The agreement requires the executives to comply with one-year non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, as well as confidentiality obligations. No payment will be made under the agreement unless a general release is signed. 
If severance payments or benefits are payable to any NEO under the CIC Severance Plan, no payments would be paid under the officer's executive severance agreement. 
Equity Award Treatment. 
Equity awards granted by Alcoa under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan generally do not provide for accelerated vesting in circumstances where the awards are not replaced by the successor in a change in control. Stock options and RSUs would continue to vest in accordance with their original vesting schedule following an employee's termination of employment due to death, disability, or retirement that occurs at least six months after the grant date and may continue to vest if the termination is as a result of Alcoa's divestiture of a business. In the case of PRSUs, such continued vesting is subject to achievement of applicable performance goals.

[END TABLE]
Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO, Roy C. Harvey, to that of our median employee. The SEC requires us to disclose the annual total compensation of each of Mr. Harvey and our median employee, as well as the ratio of their respective annual total compensation to each other (in each case, with annual total compensation calculated in accordance with SEC rules applicable to the SCT). 
The values are as follows for 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Harvey's annual total compensation—$13,196,569  
• Our median employee's annual total compensation—$84,202  
• Ratio of Mr. Harvey's annual total compensation to our median employee's annual total compensation—157:1   
[END TABLE]
A primary purpose of this disclosure is to provide stockholders with a company-specific metric that can assist in their evaluation of our executive compensation practices. We believe our compensation philosophy and process yield an equitable result for our employees. We describe below the methodology used to identify our median employee and calculate the above-disclosed values.

Executive Compensation (continued) 
Consistent with Instruction 2 to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the applicable SEC rule, Alcoa may identify its median employee for purposes of providing such pay ratio disclosure once every three years and calculate and disclose total compensation for that employee each year; provided that, during the last completed fiscal year, there has been no change in the employee population or employee compensation arrangements that the Company reasonably believes would result in a significant change to the 2017 pay ratio disclosure. Alcoa has reviewed the changes in its employee population and employee compensatory arrangements and, based on that review, determined that there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensatory arrangements that would significantly impact the 2017 pay ratio disclosure and require us to identify a new median employee. As a result, the Company has re-identified the same median employee as it did in its 2017 pay ratio disclosure. 
We identified the median employee for purposes of our 2017 pay ratio disclosure using our global employee population as of October 31, 2017. We used a consistently applied compensation measure across our global employee population, excluding Mr. Harvey, to calculate the median employee compensation. For our consistently applied compensation measure, we calculated annual total compensation by aggregating, for each applicable employee, (A) annual base salary for the trailing 12 months preceding October 31, 2017 (or, for hourly employees, the annual work schedule multiplied by hourly wage) and (B) target incentive cash compensation and/or performance pay. We then calculated the median employee's actual 2017 fiscal year compensation in the same manner as the NEOs' compensation as presented in the SCT. The initial result of this calculation led to an anomalous result for the identified median employee (who was on a leave of absence) that would result in a pay ratio that we believed did not accurately reflect the relationship between our compensation practices for a typical employee. Therefore, we selected an employee immediately adjacent to the initially-identified employee, which employee had substantially similar compensation to the original median employee based on our consistently applied compensation measure. 
The above pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of the SEC's Regulation S-K. However, the SEC's pay ratio disclosure rule affords significant flexibility to companies in determining appropriate methodologies to identify the median employee and calculating the median employee's annual total compensation. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations, business models, and compensation practices, and may utilize different methodologies to identify the median employee and calculate the median employee's annual total compensation.

Item 4 Stockholder Proposal to Amend Stockholder Ability to Act by Written Consent 
The Company has been notified of the intention to present the following resolution at our Annual Meeting. The Board and the Company accept no responsibility for the proposed resolution and supporting statement. As required by SEC rules, the resolution and supporting statement are printed verbatim below. Stockholders submitting a proposal must appear personally or by proxy at the Annual Meeting to move the proposal for consideration. Alcoa will provide the name, address and stock holding (to our knowledge) of the stockholder proponent promptly upon oral or written request made to the Secretary of the Company. The stockholder proposal follows. 
Proposal 4 - Right to Act by Written Consent 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any valid topic for written consent. 
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. 
This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if most shareholders at Allstate and Sprint had access to independent proxy voting advice. It is also more important to have a shareholder right to act by written consent since we do not have a right for 10% of shareholders to call for a special meeting. 
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is better managed by a more qualified and focused board. Our Directors and management will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus be more attentive to improving the Board of Directors and company performance. 
Please vote yes: 
Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 4 
Statement of Opposition 
The Board UNANIMOUSLY recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: 
Executive Summary of Board Opposition Statement. 
The Board of Directors believes that adoption of this proposal is unnecessary and not in the best interests of stockholders for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alcoa's Stockholders Have an Existing Right to Call a Special Meeting of Stockholders  
• Alcoa's Current Written Consent Provision is Consistent with Market Practice  
• Alcoa Has Instituted Best-In-Class Corporate Governance Practices that Protect Stockholder Interests and Ensure  Accountability  
• Written Consent by Less Than All Stockholders is Secretive, Unfair, Undemocratic, and Lacks Transparency   
• Alcoa Has Other Multiple Channels for Stockholders to Raise Matters  
• A Lower Written Consent Threshold May Cause Significant Disruption and Confusion at the Company and for Stockholders

[END TABLE]
Item 4 Stockholder Proposal to Amend Stockholder Ability to Act by Written Consent (continued) 
Alcoa's Stockholders Have an Existing Right to Call Special Meetings of Stockholders. 
Alcoa's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide for its stockholders holding at least 25% of its outstanding stock to call a special meeting of stockholders. Implementation of this proposal is unnecessary given the existing right of stockholders to call special meetings and the Company's other governance practices described herein. Alcoa's existing special meeting right strikes an appropriate balance between providing stockholders with a meaningful ability to call a special meeting and protecting against a small minority of stockholders using this mechanism for their own special interests. The Board believes that the current stockholder right to call a special meeting is the appropriate mechanism for stockholders to bring matters to the attention of the Company's stockholders between annual meetings. A meeting is an inherently more structured, democratic and open process and helps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information presented to all stockholders for their consideration and protects all stockholders' interests by giving access to a properly noticed meeting in which any stockholder may participate and vote. 
Alcoa's Current Practice with Respect to Stockholder Action by Written Consent is Consistent with Market Practice. 
Alcoa engages in a continuous quality improvement approach to corporate governance practices as deemed appropriate for our Company and in light of our existing practices. We monitor and evaluate trends in corporate governance and compare and evaluate new developments against our current practices. We understand that corporate governance is not static. Our review of current market practice shows an overwhelming majority of S&P 500 and Russell 1000 companies either do not permit stockholders to act by written consent or require that any stockholder action by written consent be unanimous. As such, most similarly sized companies do not permit the kind of stockholder action by written consent requested by the proponent and the Board believes the Company's current provisions are consistent with market practice especially considering our other corporate governance practices. 
Alcoa's Existing Corporate Governance Structure and Practices Protect Stockholder Interests and Ensure Board Accountability. 
The Board believes that the Company's existing governance structure is in line with best practices, promotes director accountability, and benefits and protects our stockholders' interests. This corporate governance structure was put in place at the time of the Company's launch in November 2016. The Company's leading governance practices include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Board. 11 of our 12 Board members are independent;  
• Separation of the Roles of CEO and Chairman. These roles are separate, and our Chairman is an independent  director;  
• Annual Elections of Directors. All of our directors are elected annually;  
• Majority Vote Standard in Uncontested Director Elections with Resignation Policy. Each director is elected by  a majority of votes cast and must tender his or her resignation if not elected;  
• Stockholder Right to Call a Special Meeting. Stockholders holding 25% of the outstanding shares of the  Company's stock for at least one year have the right to call special meetings of stockholders;  
• Proxy Access. Stockholders may nominate directors through proxy access;  
• Communication with the Board. Stockholders may communicate with any director (including our Chairman), any  Board committee, or the full Board;  
• Director Stock Ownership Requirements. Directors are required to own equity in Alcoa to have the same economic  interest in the performance of the Company as stockholders, which further aligns the directors' interests with those of our stockholders;  
• No Poison Pill. Alcoa has not adopted a rights plan;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Director Engagement. Our directors attended an average of 94% of Board and committee meetings in 2018; and   
• Annual Say on Pay Vote. At each annual meeting, stockholders are provided the opportunity to vote on  Alcoa's executive compensation programs. The Company's Say on Pay approval rating has exceeded 95% at each of the last two annual meetings.  
[END TABLE]
Proposed Action by Written Consent is a Secretive, Unfair, and Undemocratic Process, and Lacks Transparency. 
The Board believes that a stockholder meeting allows for an open and transparent forum for meaningful and important disclosure and debate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At such meetings, stockholders have the opportunity to express their views on proposed actions and participate in  deliberations and vote;  
• The time and date of such meetings are announced publicly in advance of the meeting to provide adequate notice to all  stockholders of the proposals to be considered; and  
• These and other procedures ensure that stockholders may raise matters for consideration and that all stockholders  receive notice of, and have an opportunity to voice concerns about, proposed actions affecting the Company.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that the Company's existing special meeting right strikes an appropriate balance between providing stockholders with a meaningful ability to call a special meeting and protecting against a small minority of stockholders using this mechanism for their own special interests. 
In contrast, the proposed action by written consent: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Permits a bare majority of stockholders to act alone without the knowledge and participation of all other stockholders;   
• Allows a limited number of stockholders to act on significant matters without providing advance notice of a proposal to the  stockholders;  
• Prevents stockholders from having adequate time to review the subject matter of the proposal;  
• Deprives stockholders of the opportunity to consider alternative views on the proposal, or be afforded the opportunity to  debate the merits of the proposal at an open meeting; and  
• Eliminates the need for engagement with the Company or the Board about the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
For all these reasons, the proposed process is unfair and secretive. 
Furthermore, the proposed action by written consent encourages short-term stock ownership by investors who can quietly accumulate ownership positions and take important corporate action without the procedural safeguards of waiting periods and compliance with disclosure rules, and other protections inherent in a stockholder meeting and the stockholder voting process. In effect, the proposed action by written consent could permit a limited group of stockholders to disenfranchise our minority stockholders while causing action on potentially significant matters. 
The Board believes that the current stockholder right to call a special meeting is the appropriate mechanism for stockholders to bring matters to the attention of the Company's stockholders between annual meetings. A meeting is an inherently more structured, democratic and open process and helps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information presented to all stockholders for their consideration and protects all stockholders' interests by giving access to a properly noticed meeting in which any stockholder may participate and vote. 
Stockholders Currently Have the Ability to Raise Matters through Multiple Channels. 
The Company actively engages with stockholders to provide an open and constructive forum for stockholders to express concerns. Alcoa's stockholder engagement efforts allow the Company to better understand the priorities and perspectives of its stockholders and enables Alcoa to effectively address the issues that matter most to its stockholders as deemed appropriate by the Board and management. In the past year, Alcoa has pursued multiple channels of engagement, including in-person and teleconference meetings with our stockholders. Through these activities, we discuss and receive

 input, provide additional information, and address questions on our corporate strategy, executive compensation programs, corporate governance, and other topics of interest to our stockholders. Furthermore, stockholders may use our annual meeting to communicate their concerns to management, the Board and other stockholders by including stockholder proposals in proxy materials to be considered by our full stockholder base. Additionally, stockholders have the ability to hold our directors accountable through annual elections and our majority voting standard and have the ability to nominate candidates to the Board both through traditional processes and our proxy access procedures. 
A Lower Written Consent Threshold Could Create Confusion and Disruption for Stockholders and Alcoa. 
The Board believes that permitting stockholder action by written consent is not appropriate for a widely held public company such as Alcoa. If permitted, multiple stockholder groups could solicit multiple written consents simultaneously, some of which may be duplicative or contradictory, and potentially create substantial confusion and disruption for stockholders related to the lack of transparency of a written consent process. Moreover, responding to open solicitations for written consents would impose significant administrative and financial burdens on the Company, while providing little or no corresponding benefit to stockholders.

If you were a holder of Alcoa common stock at the close of business on the record date, March 12, 2019, you are eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting. For each matter presented for vote, you have one vote for each share you own. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record, a registered stockholder, and as a beneficial  owner of shares?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholder of Record or Registered Stockholder. If your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a "stockholder of record" or a "registered stockholder" of those shares. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares. If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm, or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." In that case, you will have received these proxy materials from the bank, brokerage firm, or other similar organization holding your account and, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm, or similar organization how to vote the shares held in your account. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?  
[END TABLE]
By Telephone or Internet. All stockholders of record can vote by telephone within the U.S., U.S. territories, and Canada, by using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy or voting instruction card, or through the Internet, at the web address provided and by using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy or voting instruction card. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to vote their shares, and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. 
By Written Proxy. All stockholders of record can also vote by written proxy card. If you are a stockholder of record and receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice"), you may request a written proxy card by following the instructions included in the Notice. If you sign and return your proxy card but do not mark any selections giving specific voting instructions, your shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Alcoa Board. 
In Person. All stockholders of record may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. See Question 6 below regarding how to obtain an admission ticket to the Annual Meeting. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote by proxy as soon as possible. Your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  How do I vote if I am a beneficial owner of shares?  
[END TABLE]
Your broker is not permitted to vote on your behalf on "non-routine" matters, unless you provide specific instructions by completing and returning the voting instruction form from your broker, bank, or other similar organization or by following the instructions provided to you for voting your shares via telephone or the Internet. For the Annual Meeting, only the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors for 2019 (Item 2) is considered to be a routine matter. For your vote to be counted with respect to non-routine matters (Items 1, 3 and 4), you will need to communicate your voting decisions to your broker, bank, or other similar organization before the date of the Annual Meeting. If you wish to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank, or similar organization and bring it with you to hand in with your ballot. You will also need an admission ticket if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting; please see Question 6 below regarding how to obtain one. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  How do I vote if I participate in one of the employee savings plans?  
[END TABLE]
You must provide the trustee of the employee savings plan with your voting instructions in advance of the meeting. You may do so by returning your voting instructions by mail, or submitting them by telephone or electronically using 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 the Internet. You cannot vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting; the trustee is the only one who can vote your shares. The trustee will vote your shares as you have instructed. If the trustee does not receive your instructions, your shares generally will be voted in proportion to the way the other plan participants voted. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustee, your voting instructions must be received by 6:00 a.m., EDT, on May 7, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  How do I attend the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
You may attend the meeting if you were a stockholder as of the close of business on the record date of March 12, 2019. 
If you plan to attend the meeting, you will need an admission ticket: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholder of Record or Stockholder in Alcoa Savings Plans. If you are a  stockholder of record (meaning, your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare) or you are a participant in a retirement or savings plan maintained by Alcoa and wish to attend the Annual  Meeting, please have your Notice available and call 1-866-804-9594 or visit www.AlcoaAdmissionTicket.com and  follow the instructions provided to obtain an admission ticket. However, if you have a paper proxy card because you received the proxy materials in paper form, your admission ticket is on the top half of the proxy card. Please tear off the admission  ticket and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting, along with a valid photo identification.  
• Beneficial Owner of Shares. If a broker, bank, or other similar organization  holds your shares and you would like to attend the meeting, please write to Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858, Attention: Secretary, or email Corporate_Secretary@Alcoa.com. Please include a  copy of your brokerage account statement showing your ownership of Alcoa stock as of the record date of March 12, 2019, or a legal proxy (which you can obtain from your broker, bank, or other similar organization), and we will send you an  admission ticket. Alternatively, you may bring proof of ownership, such as your brokerage account statement, that clearly shows that you held Alcoa common stock on the record date of March 12, 2019, or a legal proxy from your bank, broker, or  other nominee. You must also bring valid photo identification.  
[END TABLE]
Please note, the Annual Meeting will begin promptly at 10:00 a.m. EDT. No late admittance will be permitted. For security purposes, no large bags, backpacks, briefcases, packages, or umbrellas will be permitted in the meeting room or adjacent areas, and other items will be subject to search. The use of cameras, audio or video recording equipment, cell phones, computers, and similar devices and recording equipment will be prohibited in the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a stockholder of record or participate in Alcoa's employee savings plans, you will receive one Notice (or if you are an employee with an Alcoa email address, an email proxy form that will be disseminated at the time the Notice and this Proxy Statement is first available to stockholders) for all shares of common stock held in or credited to your accounts as of the record date, if the account names are exactly the same. If your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account, you will receive more than one Notice or email proxy form, and in that case, you can and are urged to vote all of your shares, which will require you to vote more than once. To avoid this situation in the future, we encourage you to have all accounts registered in the same name and address whenever possible. You can do this by contacting our transfer agent, Computershare, at 1-800-522-6645 (in the U.S. and Canada) or 1-201-680-6578 (all other locations) or through the Computershare website, www.computershare.com.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  Can I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
There are several ways in which you may revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions before the time of voting at the meeting (please note that, in order to be counted, the revocation or change must be received by 6:00 a.m. EDT on May 8, 2019, or by 6:00 a.m. EDT on May 6, 2019 in the case of instructions to the trustee of an employee savings plan): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote again by telephone or at the Internet website.  
• Transmitting a revised proxy card or voting instruction form that is dated later than the prior one.

Questions and Answers About the Meeting and Voting (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders of record may vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  
• Stockholders of record may notify Alcoa's Secretary in writing that a prior proxy is revoked.  
• Employee savings plan participants may notify the plan trustee in writing that prior voting instructions are revoked or are  changed.  
[END TABLE]
The latest-dated, timely, properly completed proxy that you submit, whether by mail, telephone, or the Internet, will count as your vote. If a vote has been recorded for your shares and you subsequently submit a proxy card that is not properly signed and dated, then the previously recorded vote will stand. Your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote by ballot at the Annual Meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
Yes. Proxy cards, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify stockholders are kept confidential except: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against the Company;   
• in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; or  
• to allow the independent inspector of elections to certify the results of the vote.  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Election Services, Inc., the independent proxy tabulator used by Alcoa, counts the votes and acts as the inspector of elections for the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  What is a Broker Non-Vote?  
[END TABLE]
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker submits a proxy for a matter but does not have the authority to vote because the beneficial owner did not provide voting instructions on such matter. Under NYSE rules, the proposal to ratify the appointment of independent auditors (Item 2) is considered a "discretionary" or "routine" item. This means that brokerage firms may vote on such item in their discretion on behalf of clients (beneficial owners) who have not furnished voting instructions at least 15 days before the date of the Annual Meeting. In contrast, all of the other proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement are "non-discretionary" or "non-routine" items; brokerage firms that have not received voting instructions from their clients on these matters may not vote on these proposals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
11.  What constitutes a "quorum" for the meeting?  
[END TABLE]
A quorum is a majority of the outstanding shares that are entitled to vote as of the record date present at the meeting or represented by proxy. A quorum is necessary to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting if you have properly voted by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. If you vote to abstain on one or more proposals, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals, and how are votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
At the close of business on March 12, 2019, the record date for the meeting, Alcoa had 185,516,624 outstanding shares of common stock. Each share of common stock outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote for each director nominee and one vote for each of the other proposals to be voted on. 
Alcoa is incorporated in the State of Delaware and its shares are listed on the NYSE. As a result, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the NYSE listing standards govern the voting standards applicable to actions taken by our stockholders. Under our Bylaws, when a quorum is present, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter shall be the act of the Company's stockholders. Under the DGCL and our Bylaws, shares that abstain constitute shares that are present and entitled to vote. Shares abstaining have the practical effect of being voted "against" the matter, other than in the election of directors. 
With respect to the election of directors, in order to be elected, each nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting in respect of his or her election. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no impact, as they are not counted as votes cast for this purpose.

13.  Who pays for the solicitation of proxies?  
[END TABLE]
Alcoa pays the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies will be solicited by Alcoa on behalf of the Board by mail, telephone, other electronic means or in person. We have retained Innisfree M&A Inc., 501 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10022, to assist with the solicitation for an estimated fee of $15,000, plus expenses. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for sending proxy materials to stockholders and obtaining their votes. Our employees may also solicit proxies for no additional compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  How do I comment on Company business?  
[END TABLE]
Your comments are collected when you vote using the Internet. We also collect comments from the proxy card if you vote by mailing the proxy card. You may also send your comments to us at Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858, Attention: Secretary. Although it is not possible to respond to each stockholder, your comments help us to understand your concerns. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  When are the 2020 stockholder proposals due?  
[END TABLE]
To be considered for inclusion in the Company's 2020 proxy statement, stockholder proposals submitted in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8 must be received in writing at our principal executive offices no later than November 20, 2019.

[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  What is "householding"?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of record who have the same last name and address and who request paper copies of the proxy materials will receive only one copy unless one or more of them notifies us that they wish to receive individual copies. This method of delivery, known as "householding," will help ensure that stockholder households do not receive multiple copies of the same document, helping to reduce our printing and postage costs, as well as saving natural resources. 
We will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the 2018 Annual Report, Proxy Statement, or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, to a security holder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered. Please direct such requests to Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858, Attention: Secretary or by email at Corporate_Secretary@Alcoa.com. 
Stockholders of record may request to begin or to discontinue householding in the future by contacting our transfer agent, Computershare, at 1-800-522-6645 (in the U.S. and Canada), 1-201-680-6578 (all other locations), by mail to Computershare Investor Services, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000 or through the Computershare website, www.computershare.com. Stockholders owning their shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee may request to begin or to discontinue householding by contacting their bank, broker or other nominee.

17.  How may I obtain a copy of Alcoa's 2018 Annual Report and proxy materials?

Please direct all requests to Alcoa Corporation, 201 Isabella Street, Suite 500, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858, Attention: Secretary, call 412-315-2900, or email Corporate_Secretary@Alcoa.com.

18.  Can other business in addition to the items listed on the agenda be transacted at the meeting?
