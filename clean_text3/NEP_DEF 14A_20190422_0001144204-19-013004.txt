NextEra Energy Partners, LP 
Annual Meeting of Unitholders 
April 22, 2019 
PROXY STATEMENT 
This proxy statement contains information related to the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of NextEra Energy Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("NextEra Energy Partners," the "Company," "us" or "our"), in connection with the 2019 annual meeting of NextEra Energy Partners' unitholders to be held on Monday, April 22, 2019, at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time, at NextEra Energy Partners' principal executive offices at 700 Universe Boulevard, Juno Beach, Florida, and at any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) of the annual meeting. Directions to the annual meeting are available by calling NextEra Energy Partners Unitholder Services at 1-855-297-7440. 
ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS 
Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), NextEra Energy Partners is furnishing proxy materials to its unitholders on the internet, rather than mailing paper copies of the materials to each unitholder. 
On or about March 8, 2019, NextEra Energy Partners mailed to its unitholders of record a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials, including the proxy statement and annual report to unitholders, on the internet. The Notice also instructs unitholders on how to access their proxy card to be able to submit their proxies on the internet or by telephone. Brokerage firms and other nominees who hold NextEra Energy Partners units on behalf of beneficial owners will be sending their own similar notice. Other unitholders, in accordance with their prior requests, have received an e-mail notification of how to access the proxy materials and submit their proxies on the internet. On or about March 8, 2019, NextEra Energy Partners also began mailing a full set of proxy materials to certain unitholders, including unitholders who have previously requested a paper copy of the proxy materials. 
Internet distribution of the proxy materials is designed to expedite receipt by unitholders, lower the cost of the annual meeting and conserve natural resources. However, if you would prefer to receive printed proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice. If you have previously elected to receive NextEra Energy Partners' proxy materials electronically, you will continue to receive the materials via e-mail unless you elect otherwise. 
How do I access the proxy materials if I received the Notice? 
The Notice provides instructions regarding how to view NextEra Energy Partners' proxy materials for the 2019 annual meeting on the internet. As explained in greater detail in the Notice, to view the proxy materials and submit your proxy, you will need to follow the instructions in the Notice and have available your 16-digit control number(s) contained in the Notice. 
How do I request paper copies of the proxy materials? 
Whether you hold NextEra Energy Partners units through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee (in "street name"), or hold NextEra Energy Partners units directly in your name through NextEra Energy Partners' transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), you may request paper copies of the 2019 annual meeting proxy materials by following the instructions listed at www.proxyvote.com, by telephoning 800-579-1639 or by sending an e-mail to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING TO BE HELD APRIL 22, 2019 
This proxy statement and the NextEra Energy Partners 2018 annual report to unitholders are available at www.proxyvote.com. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
What is the purpose of the annual meeting? 
At the annual meeting, unitholders will act upon the matters identified in the accompanying notice of annual meeting of unitholders. These matters include the election of the nominees specified in this proxy statement as directors, ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 and approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation of NextEra Energy Partners' named executive officers. 
Who may attend the annual meeting? 
Subject to space availability, all unitholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the annual meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the annual meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration and seating will begin at 1:30 p.m., Eastern time. If you plan to attend, please note that you will be asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Invited representatives of the media and financial community may also attend the annual meeting. 
You will need proof of ownership of NextEra Energy Partners units on the record date to attend the annual meeting: 
 If you hold units directly in your name as a unitholder of record, you may follow the instructions in the Notice to request an admission ticket by calling 855-297-7440. 
​
 If your units are held in "street name," you will need to bring proof that you were the beneficial owner of those "street name" units of NextEra Energy Partners units as of the record date, such as a legal proxy or a copy of a bank or brokerage statement, and check in at the registration desk at the annual meeting. 
​
For the safety of attendees, all boxes, handbags and briefcases are subject to inspection. Cameras (including cell phones with photographic capabilities), recording devices and other electronic devices are not permitted at the annual meeting. 
Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting? 
Only NextEra Energy Partners unitholders at the close of business on February 22, 2019, the record date for the annual meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting. If you were a unitholder on that date, you will be entitled to vote all of the NextEra Energy Partners units that you held on that date at the annual meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting, subject to the voting rights discussed below in "What are the voting rights of the holders of the Company's units?". Unitholders includes holders of common units, Series A Preferred Units ("preferred units") and Special Voting Units ("special voting units") as of the record date. 
Each reference in this Proxy Statement to a vote of record holders of units includes record holders of common units, preferred units and special voting units. 
What are the voting rights of the holders of the Company's units? 
Each NextEra Energy Partners unit will be entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the annual meeting. A unit refers to any unit entitled to vote at the annual meeting, including common units, preferred units and special voting units. However, as explained below, a 5% voting limitation will apply to the election of directors, and, in the circumstances described below, a separate 10% vote cutback applies to certain unitholders at the annual meeting. 
What is the 5% voting limitation in the election of directors? 
The 5% voting limitation only applies to the election of directors. A unitholder or any related group, including NextEra Energy, Inc. and its affiliates (the "NextEra Energy Group"), owning more than 5% of the outstanding units as of the record date cannot vote those units that are in excess of 5% in the election of directors at the annual meeting (the "5% Director Election Limitation"). 
The following example of the 5% Director Election Limitation is included for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual ownership of units or votes at the annual meeting.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
Example of the Operation of the 5% Director Election Limitation 
What is the 10% vote cutback in the election of directors? 
In the election of directors, no unitholder may cast votes greater than 9.99% of votes actually cast. A unitholder or any related group, including the NextEra Energy Group, casting votes equal to or greater than 10% of actual votes cast will be subject to a 10% vote cutback so that such unitholder(s) cannot cast votes equal to more than 9.99% of the units actually cast in the election of directors at the annual meeting (the "10% Director Election Cutback"). The units cast in excess of 9.99% will be allocated and voted proportionally with all other votes cast. 
The following example of the 10% Director Election Cutback is included for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual ownership of units or votes at the annual meeting. 
Example of the Operation of 10% Director Election Cutback 
In the example above, the 16 votes removed from the NextEra Energy Group and the 10% holder would be allocated and voted proportionally with all other director election votes. 
How does the 10% vote cutback apply to the other items of business at the annual meeting? 
Other than in the election of directors, the 10% vote cutback does not apply to the NextEra Energy Group. A unitholder or any related group, other than the NextEra Energy Group, casting votes equal to or greater than 10% of actual votes cast will be subject to a 10% vote cutback so that such unitholder(s) cannot cast votes equal to more than 9.99% of the units actually cast on each item to be voted (the "10% Cutback"). The units cast in excess of 9.99% will be allocated and voted proportionally with all other votes cast for each item. 
The following example of the 10% Cutback for the items of business at the annual meeting other than director elections is included for illustrative purposes and does not represent actual ownership of units or votes at the annual meeting.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Example of the Operation of 10% Cutback in All Other Voting Items 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence at the annual meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the NextEra Energy Partners units issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting the business of the meeting to be conducted. 
As of the record date, 171,611,473 NextEra Energy Partners units were outstanding, including 101,440,000 special voting units, 14,021,561 preferred units and 56,149,912 common units. Thus, a total of 171,611,473 votes are entitled to be present at the annual meeting and the presence of the holders of NextEra Energy Partners units representing at least 85,805,737 units will be required to establish a quorum. 
In determining the presence of a quorum at the annual meeting, abstentions in person, proxies received but marked as abstentions as to any or all matters to be voted on that permit abstentions, and proxies received with broker non-votes on some but not all matters to be voted on will be counted as present. 
A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker, bank or other holder of record that holds units for a beneficial owner ("broker") does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary voting power for that particular proposal. Brokers may vote on ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm even if they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners whose units they hold. However, brokers may not vote on any of the other matters submitted to unitholders at the 2019 annual meeting unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. See the response to "What vote is required to approve the matters proposed?" on page 6 for a discussion of the effect of broker non-votes. 
How do I submit my proxy or voting instructions? 
On the internet or by telephone 
 On the Internet—You may submit your proxy or voting instructions on the internet 24 hours a day and up until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on Sunday, April 21, 2019 by going to www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions. Please have your Notice available when you access the web page. If you hold your units in "street name," your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee may provide additional instructions to you regarding how to submit your proxy or voting instructions on the internet. 
​
 By Telephone—You may submit your proxy or voting instructions by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number (800-690-6903) found in your Notice, 24 hours a day and up until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on Sunday, April 21, 2019 and following the prerecorded instructions. Please have your Notice available when you call. If you hold your units in "street name," your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee may provide additional instructions to you regarding how to submit your proxy or voting instructions by telephone. 
​
Please see the Notice or the information your broker provided to you for more information on your voting options. NextEra Energy Partners' proxy tabulator, Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge"), must receive any vote on the internet or by telephone, no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on Sunday, April 21, 2019.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you are a unitholder of record and you submit your proxy on the internet or by telephone, but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named as proxies in the Notice will vote the units represented by that proxy as recommended by the Board on all proposals. 
In person at the annual meeting 
All unitholders may vote in person at the annual meeting. However, if you are a beneficial owner of units, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot to be able to vote in person at the annual meeting. See the response to "Who may attend the annual meeting?" for additional information on how to attend the annual meeting. 
Your vote is important. You can save us the expense of further solicitation of proxies by submitting your proxy or voting instructions promptly. 
May I change my vote after I submit my proxy or voting instructions? 
Yes. If you are a unitholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before it is exercised by: 
 providing written notice of the revocation to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the Company's offices at P.O. Box 14000, 700 Universe Blvd., Juno Beach, Florida 33408-0420; 
​
 making timely delivery of later-dated voting instructions on the internet or by telephone; or 
​
 voting by ballot at the annual meeting; although, please note that attendance at the annual meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. 
​
You may change your proxy by using any one of these methods regardless of the method you previously used to submit your proxy. 
If you are a beneficial owner of units, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker. You may also change your vote in person at the annual meeting if you obtain a legal proxy as described in the answer to the previous question. 
All units for which proxies have been properly submitted and not revoked will be voted at the annual meeting. 
What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
NextEra Energy Partners has adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, unitholders of record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one package containing individual copies of the Notice for each unitholder of record at the address. This procedure will reduce the volume of duplicate materials unitholders receive, conserve natural resources and reduce NextEra Energy Partners' postage costs. Unitholders who participate in householding and request a full set of proxy materials will receive separate proxy cards. 
If you are a unitholder of record and are eligible for householding, but you and other unitholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple packages containing copies of the Notice or, if requested, proxy materials in paper form, or if you hold units in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single package for your household in the future, please contact Computershare in writing at Computershare Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078 or by calling 888-218-4392. You may contact Computershare at the same mailing address or telephone number if you wish to revoke your consent to future householding mailings. 
If your household receives only a single package containing a copy of the Notice or, if requested, the proxy materials, and you wish to receive a separate copy for each unitholder of record, please contact Broadridge toll-free at 866-540-7095, or write to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, and separate copies will be provided promptly. 
Beneficial owners may request information about householding from their banks, brokers or other holders of record. TABLE OF CONTENTS
What are the Board's recommendations? 
Unless you give other instructions, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. The Board's recommendations are set forth together with the description of each proposal in this proxy statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote: 
 FOR election as directors of the nominees specified in this proxy statement. (See Proposal 1) 
​
 FOR ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as NextEra Energy Partners' independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. (See Proposal 2) 
​
 FOR approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation of NextEra Energy Partners' named executive officers. (See Proposal 3) 
​
 In accordance with the discretion of the persons acting under the proxy concerning such other business as may properly be brought before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
​
What vote is required to approve the matters proposed? 
 Election as directors of the nominees specified in this proxy statement—A nominee for director will be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee's election by unitholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter exceed the votes cast by such unitholders against such nominee's election. If you are a beneficial owner, your broker is not permitted under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules to vote your units on the election of directors if your broker does not receive voting instructions from you. Without your voting instructions, a broker non-vote will occur. Since broker non-votes are not considered votes cast, they will have no legal effect on the election of directors. Abstentions are also not considered votes cast and will have no legal effect on the election of directors. For a discussion of certain voting limitations applicable to the election of directors, please see "What are the voting rights of the holders of the Company's units?" on page 2. 
​
 Ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as NextEra Energy Partners' independent registered public accounting firm for 2019—The ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as NextEra Energy Partners' independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 will be approved if the votes cast for the proposal by unitholders present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote on the matter exceed the votes cast by such unitholders against such proposal (a "Majority Vote"). Since brokers are permitted under NYSE rules to vote your units on this proposal even if your broker does not receive voting instructions from you, there are not expected to be broker non-votes on this proposal. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will have no legal effect on whether this proposal is approved. In determining the votes cast, the 10% Cutback, as described in "How does the 10% vote cutback apply to the other items of business at the annual meeting?" beginning on page 3, will apply to unitholders other than the NextEra Energy Group. 
​
 Advisory approval of the compensation of NextEra Energy Partners' named executive officers—A Majority Vote is required to approve this non-binding advisory proposal. If your broker does not receive voting instructions from you, your broker is not permitted under NYSE rules to vote your units on this proposal. Without your voting instructions, a broker non-vote will occur. Since broker non-votes are not considered votes cast, they will have no legal effect on whether this proposal is approved. Abstentions are also not considered votes cast and will have no legal effect on whether this proposal is approved. The vote on this proposal is advisory and the result of the vote on this proposal will not be binding on the Company or the Board. However, the Board will consider the result of the vote when making future decisions regarding named executive officer ("NEO") compensation. In determining the votes cast, the 10% Cutback, as described in "How does the 10% vote cutback apply to the other items of business at the annual meeting?" beginning on page 3, will apply to unitholders other than the NextEra Energy Group. 
​
Who pays for the solicitation of proxies? 
NextEra Energy Partners is soliciting proxies, and it will bear the expense of solicitation. Proxies will be solicited principally by mail and by electronic media, although directors, officers and employees of NextEra Energy Partners or its affiliates may solicit proxies personally, by telephone or by electronic means, but without compensation other than their regular compensation. NextEra Energy Partners has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist it in the solicitation of proxies, for which D.F. King & Co., Inc. will be paid a fee of  $12,500 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. NextEra Energy Partners will reimburse custodians, nominees and other persons for their out-of-pocket expenses in sending the Notice and/or proxy materials to beneficial owners.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Could other matters be decided at the annual meeting? 
At the date of printing of this proxy statement, the Board did not know of any matters to be submitted for action at the annual meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement and does not intend to bring before the annual meeting any matter other than the proposals described in this proxy statement. If, however, other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, or any adjourned or postponed meeting, your proxies include discretionary authority on the part of the individuals appointed to vote your units or act on those matters according to their discretion, including voting to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting one or more times to solicit additional proxies with respect to any proposal or for any other reason. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
BUSINESS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Proposal 1: Election of the nominees specified in this proxy statement as directors 
The Board is currently composed of seven members. The current directors are James L. Robo (Chairman), Susan D. Austin, Robert J. Byrne, Mark E. Hickson, John W. Ketchum, Rebecca Kujawa and Peter H. Kind. In accordance with our Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership ("Partnership Agreement"), four of the seven directors will be elected by unitholders at the annual meeting. The other three directors are appointed by our general partner, in its sole discretion. 
Upon the recommendation of the chief executive officer, the Board has nominated the four directors listed below for election as directors at the 2019 annual meeting ("Elected Directors"). Unless you specify otherwise in your voting instructions, your proxy will be voted FOR the Elected Directors. If any Elected Director becomes unavailable for election, which is not currently anticipated, proxies instructing a vote for that Elected Director may be voted for a substitute nominee selected by the Board. 
The Board believes that the Board membership at its current size is appropriate because such a Board size facilitates substantive discussions among Board members, provides for sufficient staffing of Board committees and allows for contributions by directors having a broad range of skills, expertise, industry knowledge and diversity of opinion. Elected Directors serve until the next annual meeting of unitholders or until their respective successors are qualified and elected.

The Company's Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at http://www.investor.nexteraenergypartners.com, identify Board membership qualifications, including experience, skills and attributes that are considered by the Board in recommending nominees for Board membership. The Board views itself as a cohesive whole consisting of members who together serve the interests of the Company and its unitholders. Qualifications, attributes and other factors considered by the Board in recommending director nominees include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 integrity, competence, insight, creativity and dedication, together with the ability to work with colleagues while challenging one another to achieve superior performance; 
​

​
 broad business experience; 
​
 the ability to exercise sound business judgment; 
​
 the ability to draw on experience relative to significant issues facing the Board and the Company; 
​
 experience in the Company's industry or in another industry or endeavor with practical application to the needs of the Company and the Board; 
​
 sufficient time and dedication for preparation as well as participation in Board and committee deliberations (including by limiting service on boards of public companies to no more than four public companies, including the Company); 
​
 possess attributes deemed appropriate given the then-current needs of the Board; 
​
 the individual's contribution to the achievement of a mix of directors who represent a diversity of background and experience, including age, gender, race, ethnicity and specialized experience; 
​
 the individual's independence as described in applicable listing standards, legislation, regulations and the Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines; and 
​
 whether the individual would be considered an "audit committee financial expert" or "financially literate" as described in applicable listing standards or regulations. 
​
Information about each director appointed by our general partner and each director nominee is presented below and includes specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the general partner and Board to the conclusion that he or she should serve as a director. Overall, the directors appointed by our general partner and the Elected Directors represent a diverse mix of qualifications deemed beneficial to the formation of a cohesive and effective Board.

Proposal 2: Ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as NextEra Energy Partners' independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 
In accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), the Audit Committee of the Board appoints the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. It has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte & Touche") as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the accounts of NextEra Energy Partners and its subsidiaries, as well as to provide its opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although ratification is not required, the Board is submitting the selection of Deloitte & Touche to unitholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If the unitholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee, although the Audit Committee may nonetheless decide to retain Deloitte & Touche as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, terminate the service of Deloitte & Touche at any time during the year if it determines that the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm would be in the best interests of NextEra Energy Partners and its unitholders. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions from unitholders at the annual meeting. 
Unless you specify otherwise in your voting instructions, your proxy will be voted FOR ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche as NextEra Energy Partners' independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

Proposal 3: Approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation of NextEra Energy Partners' named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement 
The Company is asking unitholders to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, which is commonly called a "say-on-pay" vote. The advisory vote, which is required pursuant to section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section of this proxy statement (beginning on page 36). Although this vote is not binding, it will provide information to the Board regarding investor sentiment about the Company's executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the Board will consider when making future determinations regarding named executive officer compensation. The Company currently plans to give unitholders the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on this matter every year, so that, following the vote on this proposal, the next opportunity will occur in connection with the Company's 2020 annual meeting of unitholders. 
All of the named executive officers of the company are also employees of NextEra Energy. NextEra Energy compensates these officers for the performance of their duties as employees of NextEra Energy, which include managing NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy does not allocate this compensation between services for the Company and services for NextEra Energy and its affiliates. NextEra Energy Partners' named executive officers do not receive any additional compensation for their services to NextEra Energy Partners' business. 
The Company asks unitholders to approve this proposal by approving the following non-binding resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the unitholders of NextEra Energy Partners, LP approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as described in the NextEra Energy Partners, LP proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of unitholders, including the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section.
Unless you specify otherwise in your voting instructions, your proxy will be voted FOR approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation of NextEra Energy Partners' named executive officers.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
The Company's directors and executive officers are required to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes of their beneficial ownership of NextEra Energy Partners units with the SEC pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Based solely upon a review of these filings and written representations from the directors and executive officers that no other reports were required of them, the Company believes that all required filings were timely made in 2018.
The Company's Security Trading Policy
The Company's Security Trading Policy (the "Trading Policy") prohibits hedging transactions with respect to securities of the Company. The Trading Policy provides in relevant part as follows: "Additional Prohibited Transactions. The Company considers it improper and inappropriate for any Company insider to engage in short-term or speculative transaction in the Company's securities. It therefore is the Company's policy that insiders may not engage in any of the following transactions: … Hedging Transactions. Certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions with respect to the Company's securities, such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps and collars, allow an insider to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock. These transactions allow the insider to continue to own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the insider may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other shareholders. Therefore, these transactions are prohibited under this Policy…." TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS 
Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines/Code of Ethics 
The Company's Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct & Ethics and its Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers cover a wide range of business practices and procedures. The Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct & Ethics and the Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers were approved by the Board. The Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers applies to NextEra Energy Partners' chairman of the board and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, president, treasurer, general counsel, controller and chief accounting officer and executive vice president, strategy and corporate development. The Code of Business Conduct & Ethics applies to all representatives of NextEra Energy Partners and its subsidiaries, including directors, officers and employees. The Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct & Ethics and Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers are available on the Company's website at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. Any amendments or waivers of the Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers that are required to be disclosed to unitholders under SEC rules will be disclosed on the Company's website at the address listed above. The Company will provide a printed copy of its Code of Business Conduct & Ethics upon request by a unitholder to the Corporate Secretary of NextEra Energy Partners by mail or courier service c/ o NextEra Energy Partners, LP, 700 Universe Boulevard, Juno Beach, Florida 33408, Attn: Corporate Secretary. 
Director Independence 
The NYSE does not require a listed publicly traded limited partnership, such as the Company, to have a majority of independent directors on the board of directors. The Board conducts an annual review regarding the independence from the Company of each of its members, and, in addition, assesses the independence of any new member at the time that the new member is considered for appointment to or nomination for election to the Board. The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances and uses the criteria set forth in the NYSE corporate governance independence standards (the "NYSE standards"), which are the applicable standards under SEC rules, to assess director independence. These standards are also set forth or referred to in the Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, which is available on the Company's website at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. The Board must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with NextEra Energy Partners (directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with NextEra Energy Partners) in order to determine that the director is independent. As set forth in the Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in making independence determinations. In particular, when assessing the materiality of a director's relationship (if any) with the Company, the Board considers materiality both from the standpoint of the director and from the standpoint of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. Material relationships for this purpose may include commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships, among others. 
The NYSE standards and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") include an additional requirement that members of the audit committee may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company other than their compensation for service as a director. 
Based on its review conducted in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines and the NYSE standards, the Board determined that Susan D. Austin, Robert J. Byrne and Peter H. Kind, constituting all three non-employee directors of NextEra Energy Partners, are independent under the NYSE standards (including the separate Audit Committee standards) and the Company's Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines. 
Board Leadership Structure 
As set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, the Board believes that the decision as to who should serve as chairman and as chief executive officer, and whether the offices should be combined or separate, is properly the responsibility of the Board, to be exercised from time to time in appropriate consideration of the Company's then-existing characteristics or circumstances. In view of the Company's operating record, and the operational and financial opportunities and challenges faced by the Company, the Board's judgment is that the functioning of the Board is best served by maintaining a structure of having one individual serve as both chairman and chief executive officer. The Board believes that having a single person acting in the capacities of chairman and chief executive officer promotes unified leadership and direction for the Board and executive management and allows for a single, clear focus for the chain of command to execute the Company's strategic initiatives and business plans and to address its challenges.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
Executive sessions of NextEra Energy Partners' independent directors are regularly scheduled. The chairman of the Audit Committee chairs the Board executive sessions, and thereafter provides feedback to the chairman of the Board. The Board believes that having regular Board executive sessions, three independent directors and the corporate governance structures and processes described in this proxy statement allow the Board to maintain effective oversight of management. Committee executive sessions are chaired by the committee chairs, all of whom are independent directors. The Board does not have a lead director.
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Although it is the job of management to assess and manage the Company's risks, the Board and its Audit Committee (each where applicable) discuss the guidelines and policies that govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken and evaluate reports from various functions with the management team on risk assessment and management. The Board interfaces regularly with management and receives periodic reports that include updates on financial, legal and risk management matters. The Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee also reviews and assesses the performance of the Company's internal audit function and its independent auditors. The Board receives regular reports from the Audit Committee. 
Director Meetings and Attendance 
The Board and its committees meet on a regular schedule and also hold special meetings from time to time. The Board met five times in 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served during 2018. 
The Company currently does not have a policy with regard to director attendance at the annual meeting of unitholders. All seven of the directors attended the 2017 annual meeting of unitholders. 
Board Committees 
The standing committees of the Board are the Audit Committee and the Conflicts Committee. Each committee regularly reports its activities and actions to the full Board, generally at the next Board meeting following the committee meeting. Each of the committees operates under a charter approved by the Board and the Audit Committee conducts an annual evaluation of its performance. The charter of the Audit Committee is required to comply with the NYSE corporate governance requirements. There are no NYSE requirements for the charter of the Conflicts Committee. The current membership and functions of the committees are described below. 
Compensation Committee 
Because the Company is a limited partnership, it is not required by the rules of the NYSE to have a compensation committee. NextEra Energy Partners named executive officers do not receive any additional compensation for their services to NextEra Energy Partners' business. Any compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers is reviewed and approved by the Board because it performs the functions of a compensation committee when such committee is needed. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
As discussed above, the Company does not have a compensation committee. Any compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers is reviewed and approved by the Board because it performs the functions of a compensation committee when such committee is needed. During the year ended December 31, 2018, none of the directors or executive officers served as a member of a compensation committee of another entity that has, or has had, an executive officer who served as a member of the Board during 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the following officers of NextEra Energy served on the Board: Messrs. Robo, Hickson, Ketchum and Armando Pimentel, Jr.
Nominating Committee 
Because the Company is a limited partnership, it is not required by the rules of the NYSE to have a nominating committee. All functions of a nominating committee are performed by the Board as a whole, including consideration of director nominees.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Audit Committee 
The Board has an Audit Committee composed of Messrs. Byrne (Chair) and Kind and Ms. Austin, each of whom satisfy the independence standards of the NYSE and the Exchange Act. These standards are also set forth or referred to in the Corporate Governance Principles & Guidelines, which is available on the Company's website at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee satisfies the "financial literacy" standard of the NYSE and each of them also qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as such term is defined under the SEC's regulations. The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements and the Company's compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements, corporate policies and controls. The Audit Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, approve all auditing services and related fees and the terms thereof and pre-approve any non-audit services to be rendered by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is also responsible for confirming the independence and objectivity of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and for establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints and concerns received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. The Audit Committee conducts an annual self-evaluation. The Audit Committee met five times in 2018. A more detailed description of the Audit Committee's duties and responsibilities is contained in the Audit Committee charter, which is available on the Company's website at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. 
Conflicts Committee 
The Conflicts Committee is composed of Messrs. Kind (Chair) and Byrne and Ms. Austin. The Conflicts Committee determines if the resolution of any conflict of interest referred to it is in the best interests of the Company and its unitholders. The charter of the Conflicts Committee provides that the members of the committee may not be officers or employees of NextEra Energy Partners or its general partner or directors, officers or employees of their affiliates, may not hold an ownership interest in NextEra Energy Partners' general partner or its affiliates other than NextEra Energy Partners common units, including common units or awards under any long-term incentive plan, equity compensation plan or similar plan implemented by the Company and must meet the independence standards established by the NYSE and the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors. Any matters approved by the Conflicts Committee in good faith will be deemed to be approved by all of the Company's unitholders and not a breach of any duties owed to the unitholders of the Company by NextEra Energy Partners, its general partner or the Board. A more detailed description of the Conflicts Committee's duties and responsibilities is contained in the Conflicts Committee charter, which is available on the Company's website at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. 
Consideration of Director Nominees
Proxy Access Unitholder Nominees 
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, a holder (or a group of up to 20 unitholders) owning common units representing at least 10% of the voting power, including common units and special voting units, of the Company continuously for the relevant holding period may nominate and include in the Company's proxy statement up to two directors ("Proxy Access Directors"). No more than four Proxy Access Directors are permitted to be included each year in the Company's proxy materials. Unless a shorter holding period is specified by the Board, the holding period for the 2020 annual meeting is two years. Notice of Proxy Access Director nominees for the 2020 annual meeting of unitholders should be addressed to the Corporate Secretary, NextEra Energy Partners, LP, P.O. Box 14000, 700 Universe Boulevard, Juno Beach, Florida 33408-0420 and must be received no earlier than November 7, 2019 and no later than the close of business on December 7, 2019. In the event that the 2020 annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than the anniversary date of the 2019 annual meeting, the notice of Proxy Access Director nominees must be received on the later of the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of the 2020 annual meeting or the 10th day following the public announcement of the date of the 2020 annual meeting is first made by the Company. A copy of the Partnership Agreement which contains the complete proxy access requirements is available at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. The proxy access mechanism is the exclusive means through which a common unitholder may nominate a candidate for election to the Board. 
Director Qualifications 
In addition to the qualifications for directors set forth under Proposal 1, no person will be considered for Board membership who is an employee or director of a business in significant competition with the Company or of a major or  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
potentially-major customer, supplier, contractor, counselor or consultant of the Company, or an executive officer of a business where a Company employee-director serves on such other business's board. 
Generally, no person who shall have attained the age of 72 years by the date of election shall be eligible for election as a director. However, the Board may, by unanimous action (excluding the affected director), extend a director's eligibility for one or two additional years, in which event such a director will not be eligible for election as a director if he or she has attained the age of 73 or 74 by the date of election. 
Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Directors 
Candidates may come to the attention of the Board through current Board members, professional search firms, unitholders or other persons. Candidates are evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Board, and may be considered at any time during the year. The Board considers all nominee recommendations, including those from unitholders, in the same manner when determining candidates for the Board. If any materials are provided by a unitholder in connection with the recommendation of a director candidate, such materials are provided to the Board. In evaluating nominations, the Board seeks to achieve a diverse balance of knowledge, experience and capability. For additional information about the process for nominating and electing directors, see "Proxy Access Unitholder Nominees" above and "Director Qualifications" above and as set forth under Proposal 1. 
Communications with the Board
The Board has established procedures by which unitholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board, any Board committee or any one or more other directors. Such parties may write to one or more directors, care of General Counsel, NextEra Energy Partners, LP, P.O. Box 14000, 700 Universe Boulevard, Juno Beach, Florida 33408. They may also contact any member of the Audit Committee with a concern under the Company's Code of Business Conduct & Ethics by calling 561-694-4644. 
The Board has instructed the Company's general counsel to assist the Board in reviewing all written communications to the Board, any Board committee or any director as follows: 
(1)
Complaints or similar communications regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters will be handled in accordance with the NextEra Energy Partners, LP Procedures for Receipt, Retention and Treatment of Complaints and Concerns Regarding Accounting, Internal Accounting Controls or Auditing Matters. 
​
(2)
All other legitimate communications related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board or any committee will be promptly forwarded by the general counsel to the applicable directors, including, as appropriate under the circumstances, to the chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and/or the appropriate committee chair. 
​
(3)
All other unitholder, customer, vendor, employee and other complaints, concerns and communications will be handled by management, with Board involvement as advisable with respect to those matters that management reasonably concludes to be significant. 
​
Communications that are of a personal nature or not related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board, that are unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly inappropriate or unsuitable, that are conclusory or vague in nature, or that are surveys, junk mail, resumes, service or product inquiries or complaints, or business solicitations or advertisements, generally will not be forwarded to any director unless the director otherwise requests or the general counsel determines otherwise. 
Procedures for Review, Approval and Ratification of Related Person Transactions
The Conflicts Committee of the Board reviews and approves related person transactions to the extent required by the Partnership Agreement or to the extent that the Board seeks the approval of the Conflicts Committee. 
The management of the Company is charged with primary responsibility for determining whether, based on the facts and circumstances, a proposed transaction is a related person transaction. For the purposes of this determination, (1) a related person includes any director or executive officer of the Company, any nominee for director of the Company, any unitholder known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities, and any immediate family member of any such person and (2) a related person transaction includes any transaction, since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, or any currently proposed transaction, in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
If, after weighing all of the facts and circumstances, management determines that a proposed transaction is a related person transaction, management must present the proposed transaction to the Board for review or, if impracticable under the circumstances, to the chairman of the board. The Board must then either approve or reject the transaction. The Board may, but is not required to, seek the approval of the Conflicts Committee for the resolution of any related person transaction. 
In addition, certain transactions must be referred to the Conflicts Committee pursuant to the terms of the Company's partnership agreement and the conflicts committee's charter. The Conflicts Committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.nexteraenergypartners.com. 
Transactions with Related Persons
NextEra Energy Equity Partners, LP ("NEE Equity"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy, owns all of the Company's special voting units and a majority of the common units of NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP ("NEP OpCo"). 
The following is a summary of certain agreements between the Company and NextEra Energy or its affiliates. Because of the Company's relationship with NextEra Energy, the agreements may not be as favorable to the Company as they might have been had the Company negotiated them with an unaffiliated third party. 
Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement 
The Company, NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC, NEP OpCo's general partner ("NEP OpCo GP") entered into the Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement, dated August 4, 2017 (the "MSA"), with NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP ("NEE Management"), under which: 
 NEE Management provides or arranges for the provision of management, operations and administrative services to the Company and its subsidiaries under the direction of the Board, including managing their day-to-day affairs and providing individuals to act as executive officers and directors, to the extent such services are not otherwise provided under operations and maintenance services agreements and administrative service agreements ("ASAs") between affiliates of NextEra Energy and the Company's subsidiaries; 
​
 NEP OpCo pays, on the Company's behalf, all operations and maintenance services fees or other expenses the Company or its subsidiaries incur; and 
​
 NEP OpCo makes certain payments to NEE Management based on the achievement by NEP OpCo of certain target quarterly distribution levels to its common unitholders. 
​
Under the MSA, among other restrictions, NEE Management, its subsidiaries and any other entity or individual that NEE Management has arranged to provide services are required to refrain from taking any action that, to NEE Management's knowledge, at the time such action is taken, is intended to materially conflict with or directly contravene any resolution or other determination of the Board, in each case relating to the following significant activities of the Company: 
 establishing and approving the Company's annual operating budget; 
​
 evaluating and approving capital decisions; 
​
 evaluating and approving debt and equity financing decisions; 
​
 assessing and approving quarterly cash distributions to unitholders; and 
​
 analyzing and approving related party transactions among NEE Management, its subsidiaries and any other entity or individual that NEE Management has arranged to provide services. 
​
NEP OpCo pays NEE Management an annual management fee equal to the greater of  (1) 1% of the sum of NEP OpCo's net income plus interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense less certain non-cash, non-recurring items for the most recently ended fiscal year (calculated prior to the deduction of such fee and other fees paid under the MSA, such amount the "calculated fee") and (2) $4 million (adjusted for inflation beginning in 2016). The management fee is paid in quarterly installments of  $1 million (adjusted for inflation beginning in 2016) with an additional payment each January to the extent the calculated fee exceeds $4 million in the prior fiscal year (adjusted for inflation beginning in 2016). NEE Management is also entitled to receive an incentive distribution right fee ("IDR fee") based on the hypothetical amount of distributions NEP OpCo would be able to make to its common unitholders without giving effect to  TABLE OF CONTENTS
the IDR fee as an operating expense. The IDR Fee payments to NEE Management under the MSA will continue for so long as NEP OpCo's partnership agreement remains in effect, even if the MSA otherwise terminates in accordance with its terms. For the year ended December 31, 2018, NEE Management received a total of approximately $78 million in compensation under the MSA, including the IDR fees. 
The MSA is in full force and effect until January 1, 2068 and will automatically renew for successive five-year periods unless NEP OpCo or NEE Management provides written notice that it does not wish the agreement to be renewed. However, NEP OpCo is able to terminate the MSA prior to the expiration of its term upon 90 days' prior written notice of termination to NEE Management upon the occurrence of certain events. The MSA also expressly provides that the agreement may not be terminated by the Company due solely to the poor performance or the under-performance of any of the Company's operations. NEE Management is also permitted to terminate the MSA upon the occurrence of certain events.

determined by a curtailment consultant that such New NextEra Project will have a detrimental effect on Perrin Ranch or Tuscola Bay, as applicable, upon the commencement of operations of such New NextEra Project, the New NextEra Project will agree to be curtailed prior to any required curtailment of Perrin Ranch or Tuscola Bay, as applicable. NextEra Energy Resources has also agreed that prior to the transfer to a non-affiliate of any direct or indirect interest in an affiliate of NextEra Energy Resources that has the right to construct a New NextEra Project, the non-affiliate will be required to become a party to the applicable Adverse Effect Agreement. 
Cash Sweep and Credit Support Agreement 
NextEra Energy Resources and certain of its affiliates have provided credit support (e.g., letters of credit and guarantees) to, among other persons, energy sale counterparties, interconnection providers, permitting authorities and lenders to the Company's subsidiaries to satisfy contractual and permit obligations of the Company's subsidiaries, to substitute for cash reserves they are required to maintain and to facilitate NextEra Energy's cash management practices. NEP OpCo has entered into the Amended and Restated Cash Sweep and Credit Support Agreement, dated August 4, 2017 (the "CSCS Agreement"), with NextEra Energy Resources, under which: 
 NextEra Energy Resources provides certain existing limited credit support on behalf of the Company's subsidiaries for the projects and, upon NEP OpCo's request and at NextEra Energy Resources' option, may agree to provide credit support on behalf of any projects the Company may acquire in the future on similar terms, and NEP OpCo will reimburse NextEra Energy Resources to the extent NextEra Energy Resources or its affiliates are required to make payments under such credit support or to post cash collateral, subject to certain exceptions; and 
​
 when the projects in the Company's portfolio receive revenues or when NEP OpCo receives distributions from the Company's subsidiaries, NextEra Energy Resources or one of its affiliates borrow excess funds from the Company's subsidiaries, including NEP OpCo, and holds them in an account of NextEra Energy Resources or one of its affiliates for the benefit of NextEra Energy Resources and its affiliates until such funds are required to fund distributions or pay the Company's subsidiaries' expenses or NEP OpCo otherwise demands the returns of such funds. 
​
NEP OpCo pays NextEra Energy Resources an annual credit support fee that is based on NextEra Energy's borrowing costs, subject to adjustment. The fee is calculated as a fixed percentage of the aggregate amount of continuing credit support provided by NextEra Energy Resources or its affiliates to the Company's subsidiaries, excluding credit support for which the Company's subsidiaries do not have reimbursement obligations. If the aggregate amount of such credit support by NextEra Energy Resources or its affiliates increases or decreases, the credit support fee is adjusted accordingly as determined in good faith by NextEra Energy Resources. For the year ended December 31, 2018, NEP OpCo paid NextEra Energy Resources approximately $4 million under the CSCS Agreement. 
The term of the CSCS Agreement is for ten years from July 1, 2014 and will automatically renew for successive five-year periods unless NEP OpCo or NextEra Energy Resources provides written notice that it does not wish the agreement to be renewed. However, in certain limited circumstances NEP OpCo is permitted to terminate the CSCS Agreement prior to the expiration of its term upon 90 days' prior written notice of termination to NextEra Energy Resources. In certain limited circumstances, NextEra Energy Resources is permitted to terminate the CSCS Agreement upon 180 days' prior written notice of termination to the Company.

This right of first offer does not apply to a merger of NextEra Energy Resources with or into, or sale of substantially all of NextEra Energy Resources' assets to, an unaffiliated third party, any sale of any NEER ROFO project following which NextEra Energy Resources continues to hold directly or indirectly 100% of the ownership interests in and maintains control over such NEER ROFO project or any sale of NEE Equity's or its affiliates' direct or indirect interests in NEP OpCo. However, NextEra Energy Resources is not obligated to sell the NEER ROFO projects and, therefore, the Company does not know when, if ever, these projects will be offered to NEP OpCo. Even if an offer is made to NEP OpCo, NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Resources may not reach an agreement on the terms for the sale of the applicable NEER ROFO project.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Right of First Refusal (ROFR) Agreement 
The Company and NEP OpCo have granted NextEra Energy Resources a right of first refusal on any proposed sale of any NEP OpCo asset. Pursuant to the terms of the Right of First Refusal Agreement, dated as of August 4, 2017, among the Company, NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Resources, prior to engaging in any negotiation regarding any sale of a NEP OpCo asset, NEP OpCo must first negotiate for 30 days with NextEra Energy Resources to attempt to reach an agreement on a sale of such asset to NextEra Energy Resources or any of its subsidiaries. If an agreement is not reached within the initial 30-day period, NEP OpCo will be able for a 30-day period to negotiate with any third party for the sale of such asset, but prior to accepting any third party offer, NEP OpCo will be required to restart negotiations with NextEra Energy Resources for the next 30 days and will not be permitted to sell the applicable asset to the third party making the offer if NextEra Energy Resources agrees to terms substantially consistent with those proposed by such third party. If, by the end of the second 30-day period, NextEra Energy Resources and NEP OpCo have not reached an agreement, NEP OpCo will have the right to sell such asset to such third party within 30 days. 
Licensing Agreements 
Under a trademark licensing agreement, NextEra Energy has granted the Company a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable license to use the names "NextEra" and "NextEra Energy" in the U.S. The licensing agreement can be amended only by written agreement of the parties to such agreement.

Exchange Agreement 
The Company entered into the Exchange Agreement with NEP OpCo and NEE Equity, under which NEE Equity can tender NEP OpCo units for redemption to NEP OpCo. NEE Equity has the right to receive, at its election, either common units of the Company or a cash amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale by the Company of an equivalent number of the Company's common units issued to fund such redemption; provided that NEP OpCo will only be required to pay the cash amount to the extent it has received corresponding capital contributions from the Company, although the Exchange Agreement does not require the Company to make such capital contributions. In addition, the Company has the right but not the obligation, to directly purchase such tendered common units for, subject to the approval of the Company's Conflicts Committee, cash or the Company's common units. The Exchange Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, NEE Equity does not have the right to exchange its NEP OpCo units if NEP OpCo or the Company determines that such exchange would be prohibited by law or regulation or would violate other agreements to which the Company may be subject. 
If NEE Equity elects to receive the Company's common units in exchange for NEE Equity's tendered NEP OpCo units, the exchange will be on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of splits, combinations of units and similar events. If NEE Equity elects to receive cash in exchange for NEE Equity's tendered NEP OpCo units, or if the Company exercises its right to purchase tendered NEP OpCo units for cash, the amount of cash payable will be based on the net proceeds received by the Company in a sale of an equivalent number of NEP's common units.

AUDIT-RELATED MATTERS 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee submits the following report for 2018: 
In accordance with the written Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee of the Company (the "Audit Committee") assists the Board of Directors ("Board") in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company. The Audit Committee meets and discusses, among other things, the interim financial information contained in each quarterly earnings announcement with the chief financial officer, the chief accounting officer and the independent registered public accounting firm prior to public release. 
As specified in the Audit Committee Charter, it is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These are the responsibilities of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and management. In discharging the duties of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee has relied on (1) management's representations to us that the financial statements prepared by management have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and (2) the report of the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to such financial statements. 
The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm all communications required by generally accepted auditing standards, including those required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," and discussed and reviewed the results of the firm's audit of the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed the results of the internal audit examinations. 
The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with them their independence. The Audit Committee also reviewed any relationships that may affect the objectivity and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and satisfied itself as to the firm's independence and discussed with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the internal audit function's organization, responsibilities, resources and staffing. The Audit Committee reviewed with both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors their audit plans, audit scope and identification of audit risks. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management has the responsibility for the preparation of the Company's financial statements and the independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility for the audit of those statements. 
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In addition, and in accordance with its audit committee charter, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm management's internal control report, management's assessment of the internal control structure and procedures of the Company for financial reporting and the independent registered public accounting firm's opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, all as required to be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee charter and the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy for services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, all services performed by Deloitte & Touche are approved in advance by the Audit Committee. Audit and audit-related services specifically identified in an appendix to the pre-approval policy for which the fee is expected to be $250,000 or less are pre-approved by the Audit Committee each year. This pre-approval allows management to request the specified audit and audit-related services on an as-needed basis during the year, provided any such services are reviewed with the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any audit or audit-related service for which the fee is expected to exceed $250,000, or that involves a service not listed on the pre-approval list, must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee prior to commencement of such service. In addition, the Audit Committee approves all services other than audit and audit-related services performed by Deloitte & Touche in advance of the commencement of such work. The Audit Committee has delegated to the chair of the committee the right to approve audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within certain limitations, between meetings of the audit committee, provided any such decision is presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
In 2018 and 2017, no services provided to NextEra Energy Partners by Deloitte & Touche were approved by the Audit Committee after services were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X (which provides for a waiver of the otherwise applicable pre-approval requirement if certain conditions are met). Additionally, none of the services were approved after services were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​

The Named Executive Officers for the year ended December 31, 2018 are James L. Robo (chief executive officer) and John W. Ketchum (chief financial officer). The 2019 NextEra Energy proxy statement will include disclosure of the compensation of these officers, who also serve as executive officers of NextEra Energy, received from NextEra Energy for the performance of their duties as employees of NextEra Energy. 
In February 2018, as part of NextEra Energy's Compensation Committee's setting of 2018 long-term performance-based incentive compensation for its executive officers, the Compensation Committee expressed its preference that a portion of the long-term performance-based incentive compensation to be awarded to executive officers who are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners be granted in the form of performance-based restricted common units of the Company ("NEP Awards"). The Compensation Committee concluded that the proposed NEP Awards would further align the incentive compensation of these executive officers to activities that promote the growth of long-term value for shareholders of NextEra Energy. After considering this and other factors, in February 2018, the Board approved grants of NEP Awards to those executive officers of NextEra Energy who are also officers of the Company, as well as to other officers and employees of NextEra Energy or its affiliates who are responsible for significant Company activities. 
The NEP Awards received by executive officers did not increase the executive officers' overall incentive compensation opportunity, but instead replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis approximately 7% of the aggregate grant date value of the portion of their long-term performance-based awards in 2018 that otherwise would have been issued in the form of performance-based restricted stock of NextEra Energy. The performance objective for NEP Awards is adjusted EBITDA of $400 million. Therefore, the NEP Awards granted in 2018, which would otherwise vest ratably in 2019, 2020 and 2021, will not vest unless and until the Board certifies that NEP's adjusted EBITDA for each of 2019, 2020 and 2021 equals or exceeds $400 million. 
The NEP Awards were made pursuant to the NextEra Energy Partners, LP 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan ("2014 Long Term Incentive Plan"). The Company will be reimbursed by NextEra Energy for the grant date fair value of all NEP Awards granted to employees and officers of the NextEra Energy or its affiliates. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Board does not have a compensation committee. The Board, acting in lieu of a compensation committee, has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Board recommended that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis set forth above be included in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of unitholders. 
Respectfully submitted, 
By the members of the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy Partners:
