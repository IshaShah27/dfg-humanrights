The Accounts' shareholders of record are insurance company separate accounts that offer variable life and variable annuity contracts.You are receiving these materials because you own a variable annuity contract or variable life insurance policy issued by an insurance company that is a shareholder of record, and you have allocated contract value of such contract or policy to one or more Accounts.

Your insurance company will vote, in accordance with your instructions, the number of Account shares that represents that portion of your contract value invested in each of the Accounts as of the Record Date.

Each shareholder of record at the close of business on February 21, 2019, the record date for the Meeting, is entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. The Accounts' shareholders of record are insurance company separate accounts that offer variable life and variable annuity contracts. If you are a Contract Owner, you are receiving these materials because you own a variable annuity contract or variable life insurance policy issued by an insurance company that is a shareholder of record, and you have allocated contract value of such contract or policy to one or more Accounts. As a result, you have the right to instruct your insurance company how to vote the shares of the Accounts that represent your contract value.
Your vote is important.  No matter how many shares you own, please vote.  If you have allocated your contract value to more than one Account, you will have a separate voting instruction card for each such Account, and you need to return all of the voting instruction cards (or follow the instructions to vote by telephone and on the Internet).  To save your Account(s) from incurring the cost of additional solicitations, please review the materials and vote today.

VOTING INFORMATION
Voting procedures.  We are furnishing this Proxy Statement to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board to be used at the Meeting. Please vote your shares by mailing the enclosed card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or by following the instructions on the card(s) for voting by telephone or via the Internet. Shareholders who wish to attend the Meeting in person may call 1-800-222-5852 if they have any questions.
If you complete and return the enclosed voting instruction card(s) (or if you give your proxy by telephone or via the Internet), the persons named on the card as proxies will vote your shares as you indicate on the card(s) (or as you instruct by telephone or via the Internet) or for approval of each proposal for which there is no indication. You may change your vote and revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Meeting in any of the following ways: 
(i) by sending a written notice of revocation to the Meeting Secretary of Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. in care of Principal Financial Group, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392; 
(ii) by submitting another properly signed card at a later date to the Meeting Secretary of Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. in care of Principal Financial Group, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392; 
(iii) by submitting another proxy by telephone or via the Internet at a later date; or 
(iv) being present and voting in person at the Meeting after giving oral notice of the revocation to the Chair of the Meeting. Voting rights.  Only shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to vote. The shareholders of all Accounts and all share classes will vote together on Proposal 1 regarding the election of Directors. The shareholders of each Account subject to the proposal will vote together and not by class of shares for Proposals 2 - 4. You are entitled to one vote on each proposal submitted to the shareholders of an Account for each share of that Account you hold, and fractional votes for fractional shares held.  
The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares voted at the Meeting is required for the election of a Director under Proposal 1.  This means that those nominees for Director receiving the highest number of votes cast at the Meeting will be elected. The nominees are running unopposed, so each nominee is expected to be elected as a Director because all nominees who receive votes in favor will be elected. Proposals 2 - 4 require for approval the vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities," which is defined in the 1940 Act to mean, with respect to an Account, the affirmative vote of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Account present in person or by proxy at the meeting of that Account, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Account are present in person or by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Account (such lesser amount being a "Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities").  Under this definition, a proposal could be approved by as little as approximately one-third of the outstanding voting securities of the Account to which that proposal applies.  
The number of votes eligible to be cast at the Meeting with respect to each Account as of the Record Date and other share ownership information are set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Quorum requirements; abstentions and broker non-votes.  A quorum must be present at the Meeting for the transaction of business by any Account. For Proposal 1, the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the shares of PVC outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date constitutes a quorum. For Proposals 2 - 4, the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the shares of each applicable Account outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date constitutes a quorum for a meeting of that Account. 
Abstentions, if any, will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum but will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on a proposal. As a result, with respect to (i) Proposal 1 requiring the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares cast at the Meeting, abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal, and (ii) Proposals 2 - 4 requiring the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities, as defined above, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against such proposals.
Broker non-votes, if any, will also be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum but will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on a proposal. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or nominee indicates it has not received voting instructions from a shareholder and is barred from voting the shares without such shareholder instructions because the proposal is considered non-routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Proposals 2 - 4 may be considered non-routine, so your broker or nominee likely will not be permitted to vote your shares if it has not received instructions from you, resulting in broker non-votes. A broker non-vote on Proposals 2 - 4 will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal.  Proposal 1 is considered routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, so if you do not give your broker or nominee voting instructions on this proposal, your broker or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion, resulting in no broker non-votes. However, if your broker or nominee does not exercise such discretion and a broker non-vote results, such broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1.
If the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve a proposal is not obtained at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies or any shareholder present at the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting as to one or more proposals in accordance with applicable law to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment as to a proposal or any other matter with respect to an Account will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Account present in person or by proxy at the Meeting.  The persons named as proxies and any shareholder present at the Meeting will vote for or against any adjournment in their discretion.
Contract Owner voting instructions.  Shares of the Accounts are sold to Separate Accounts of the Insurance Companies and are used to fund benefits under Contracts. Each Contract Owner has the right to instruct your Insurance Company how to vote the shares of the Accounts that represent your contract value. You can do so by marking voting instructions on the voting instruction card(s) enclosed with this Proxy Statement and then signing and dating the voting instruction card(s) and mailing the card in the envelope provided.  If a card is not marked to indicate voting instructions, but is signed, dated, and returned, it will be treated as an instruction to vote the shares in favor of the proposals.  Each Insurance Company will vote the shares for which it receives timely voting instructions from Contract Owners in accordance with those instructions. Each Insurance Company will vote  the shares for which it does not receive timely voting instructions from Contract Owners in the same proportion as votes cast by Contract Owners.  Accordingly, there are not expected to be any broker non-votes. Because of the proportional voting described above, it is unlikely that quorum requirements for the Meeting will not be satisfied, and, as a result, a small number of Contract Owners can determine the outcome of the voting.
Solicitation procedures.  We intend to solicit proxies by mail.  Officers or employees of PVC, PGI, or their affiliates may make additional solicitations by telephone, Internet, or personal contact.  They will not be specially compensated for these services.  Brokerage houses, banks, and other fiduciaries may be requested to forward soliciting materials to their customers and to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies.  For those services, PVC will reimburse them for their out-of-pocket expenses.  PVC has retained the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., to assist in soliciting proxies and provide other services in connection therewith and estimates that the aggregate cost of such services will be approximately $180,000. 
Expenses of the Meeting.  The Accounts will pay the expenses of the Meeting, including those associated with the preparation and distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies. The expenses will be allocated to the Account(s) generating the expense, based on the number of Contract Owners.  
PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
(All Accounts)
At its January 31, 2019 meeting, the Board named the twelve persons listed below as nominees for election as Directors. Eleven of the nominees currently serve as Directors. The other nominee, Timothy M. Dunbar, will become a Director immediately if he is elected as a Director at the Meeting. If elected, Mr. Dunbar will fill the vacancy on the Board created by the departure of Nora Everett, who on November 28, 2018 announced her intention to retire as Chair and member of the Board, effective March 12, 2019.
Each nominee has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will become unavailable for election as a Director. However, if that should occur before the Meeting, your proxy will be voted for the individual(s) recommended by the Board to fill each resulting vacancy.
The following table presents certain information regarding PVC's Directors and the new nominee, including their principal occupations and other directorships. Ms. Everett is not standing for re-election at the Meeting because she is retiring from the Board prior to the date of the Meeting. Information is listed separately for those Directors and nominees who are "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of PVC (the "Interested Directors") and those Directors and nominees who are not interested persons of PVC (the "Independent Directors").  Three of the nominees for Independent Director, Ms. McMillan, Ms. Nickels, and Ms. VanDeWeghe, have not previously been elected Directors by PVC's shareholders. The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee, composed of two of PVC's Independent Directors, selected and nominated Ms. McMillan, Ms. Nickels, and Ms. VanDeWeghe as candidates for Director upon the recommendations of one or more of the Directors. Two of the nominees for Interested Director, Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Halter, have not previously been elected Directors by PVC's shareholders, and both were selected and nominated as candidates for Director upon the recommendations of affiliated persons of PGI, PVC's investment advisor.
All individuals who are current Directors also serve as directors of PFI, another mutual fund sponsored by Principal Life, and as trustees of PETF, an exchange-traded fund sponsored by Principal Life. All individuals who are nominees as Directors are also currently standing as nominees for election as directors or trustees, as applicable, of PFI and PETF and, if elected by those respective shareholders, will serve as directors or trustees, as applicable, of PFI and PETF.  If the same individuals are not elected by the shareholders of each of PVC, PFI, and PETF, the compositions of their boards will differ.  PVC, PFI, and PETF (collectively, the "Fund Complex") currently offer shares of a combined total of 131 funds. 
Each Director will serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until a successor is elected and qualified.

Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors
Overall responsibility for directing PVC's business and affairs rests with the Board of Directors, who are elected by PVC's shareholders.  In addition to serving on the PVC Board, each Director serves on the PFI Board and the  PETF Board.  The Board is responsible for overseeing PVC's operations in accordance with the 1940 Act, other applicable laws, and PVC's charter.  The Board elects the officers of PVC to supervise its day-to-day operations.  The Board meets in regularly scheduled meetings eight times throughout the year.  Board meetings may occur in-person or by telephone.  In addition, the Board holds special meetings or informal calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regularly scheduled meetings.  Board members who are Independent Directors meet annually to consider renewal of PVC's advisory contracts. Each Director and Director nominee has significant prior senior management and/or board experience. 
As of the Record Date, the Board is composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Directors. As stated above, on November 28, 2018, Ms. Everett announced her intention to retire as Chair and member of the Board, effective March 12, 2019. Mr. Dunbar will fill the Board vacancy created by Ms. Everett's retirement, effective immediately if he is elected a Director at the Meeting. Following Ms. Everett's retirement and if Mr. Dunbar is elected, the Board will continue to be composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Directors.
     Currently, the Chair of the Board, Nora Everett, is an interested person of PVC.  The Independent Directors of PVC have appointed a lead Independent Director whose role is to review and approve, with the Chair, the agenda for each Board meeting and facilitate communication among PVC's Independent Directors as well as communication among the Independent Directors, PVC management and the full Board.  PVC has determined that the Board's leadership structure is appropriate given the characteristics and circumstances of PVC, including such items as the number of series that comprise PVC, the variety of asset classes those series reflect, the net assets of PVC, the committee structure of the Board and the distribution arrangements of PVC.  The appropriateness of this structure is enhanced by PVC's Board committees, which are described below, and the allocation of responsibilities among them.  Following Ms. Everett's retirement on March 12, 2019, the Board will elect a new Chair based upon its assessment of an appropriate leadership structure for the Board.
The Directors were selected to serve, and continue to serve, on the Board based upon their skills, experience, judgment, analytical ability, diligence and ability to work effectively with other Board members, a commitment to the interests of shareholders, and, for each Independent Director, a demonstrated willingness to take an independent and questioning view of management.  In addition to these general qualifications, the Board seeks members who will build upon the diversity of the Board.  The following is a brief discussion of the specific education, experience, qualifications, or skills that led to the conclusion that each person identified below should serve as a Director.  As required by rules the SEC has adopted under the 1940 Act, PVC's Independent Directors select and nominate all candidates for Independent Director positions. Independent Directors

The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of PVC's compliance program and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for PVC and its principal service providers.  In addition, as part of the Board's periodic review of PVC's advisory, sub-advisory, and other service provider agreements, the Board may consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible.  With respect to valuation, the Board oversees a PGI valuation committee comprised of PVC and PGI officers and has approved and periodically reviews valuation policies applicable to valuing PVC's shares.
The Board has established the following committees and the membership of each committee to assist in its oversight functions, including its oversight of the risks PVC faces.
Board Committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board in fulfilling certain of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee serves as an independent and objective party to monitor PVC's accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control system, as well as the work of the independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee assists Board oversight of (1) the integrity of PVC's financial statements; (2) PVC's compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements; (3) the independent registered public accountants' qualifications and independence; and (4) the performance of PVC's independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee also provides an open avenue of communication among PVC's independent registered public accountants, PGI's internal auditors, PVC management, and the Board. The Audit Committee held seven meetings during the last fiscal year.  The Audit Committee is composed of Mr. Barnes, Mr. Damos, and Ms. Nickels.
A copy of the Audit Committee Charter of the Board is included as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee's primary purpose is to exercise certain powers of the Board when the Board is not in session. When the Board is not in session, the Executive Committee may exercise all powers of the Board in the management of the business of PVC except the power to (1) issue stock, except as permitted by law; (2) recommend to the shareholders any action that requires shareholder approval; (3) amend PVC's charter or bylaws; or (4) approve any merger or share exchange that does not require shareholder approval. The Executive Committee held no meetings during the last fiscal year. As of the Record Date, the Executive Committee is composed of Mr.  Grimmett, Mr. Beer, and Ms. Everett. Following Ms. Everett's retirement on March 12, 2019, the Board will appoint a third Director to serve on this committee.
Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance Committee's primary purpose is to oversee the structure and efficiency of the Board and the committees established by the Board.  The Nominating and Governance Committee responsibilities include evaluating Board membership and functions, committee membership and functions, insurance coverage, and legal matters.
The nominating functions of the Nominating and Governance Committee include selecting and nominating all candidates who are not "interested persons" of PVC for election to the Board.  Generally, the Nominating and Governance Committee requests director nominee suggestions from the Board and management.  In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by PVC shareholders. 
Director recommendations should be submitted in writing to Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. at 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392.  When evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as an Independent Director, the Nominating and Governance Committee will generally consider, among other factors: age; education; relevant business experience; geographical factors; whether the person is "independent" and otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a director; and whether the person is willing to serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for attendance at meetings and the performance of the duties of an independent director.  The Nominating and Governance Committee also meets personally with the nominees and conducts a reference check. The final decision regarding a nominee is based on a combination of factors, including the strengths and the experience a specific individual may bring to the Board.  The Nominating and Governance Committee believes the Board generally benefits from diversity of background, experience, and views among its members, and considers this a factor in evaluating the composition of the Board.  The Board does not use regularly the services of any professional search firms to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential candidates or nominees.  The Nominating and Governance Committee held four meetings during the last fiscal year.  The Nominating and Governance Committee is composed of Ms. Ballantine and Mr. Grimmett.
A copy of the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter of the Board is included as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement.
Operations Committee
The Operations Committee's primary purpose is to oversee the provision of administrative and distribution services to PVC, communications with PVC's shareholders, and review and oversight of PVC's operations.  The Operations Committee held four meetings during the last fiscal year.  The Operations Committee is composed of Mr. Hirsch, Mr. Huang, Ms. McMillan, and Ms. VanDeWeghe.
15(c) Committee
     The 15(c) Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board in performing the annual review of PVC's advisory and sub-advisory agreements pursuant to Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act. The 15(c) Committee's responsibilities include requesting and reviewing materials. The 15(c) Committee held five meetings during the last fiscal year. The 15(c) Committee is composed of Mr. Damos, Mr. Grimmett, Mr. Hirsch, and Mr. Huang. 
Compensation
PVC does not pay any remuneration to its Directors or officers who are employed by PGI or its affiliates. The Board annually considers a proposal to reimburse PGI for a portion of the Chief Compliance Officer's compensation. If the proposal is adopted, these amounts are allocated across all Accounts based on relative net assets of each portfolio. Each Director who is not an "interested person" received compensation for service as a member of the Boards of PVC, PFI, and PETF based on a schedule that takes into account an annual retainer amount and the number of meetings attended. Responsibility for these fees and expenses are divided among the portfolios of PVC, PFI, and PETF based on their relative net assets.
The following table provides information regarding the compensation received by the Independent Directors from PVC and from the Fund Complex during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  As stated above, the Fund Complex includes PVC, PFI, and PETF.  PVC does not provide retirement benefits to any Director.

The following tables set forth the dollar range of the equity securities of each Account, and the aggregate dollar range of the equity securities of all funds within the Fund Complex, which the Directors and Director nominee beneficially owned as of December 31, 2018.  As of December 31, 2018, each of the Directors listed in the table did not beneficially own shares of funds that do not appear in the table.
As stated above, the Fund Complex includes PVC, PFI, and PETF.  For the purpose of these tables, beneficial ownership means a direct or indirect pecuniary interest.  Directors who beneficially owned shares of a series of PVC did so through variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by Principal Life.  Only the Directors who are "interested persons" are eligible to participate in a PFG employee benefit program that invests in PFI.  Ownership is listed based on the following dollar ranges:

Background 
      Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act generally requires an investment company to obtain shareholder approval before retaining a new sub-advisor or making material changes to an existing sub-advisory agreement. On January 19, 1999, the SEC granted an exemptive order to, among others, the Group A Accounts and PGI(1) that allows them to enter into and materially amend agreements with unaffiliated sub-advisors without requiring shareholder approval (the "Unaffiliated Order"). Subsequently, on September 8, 2014, the SEC granted an order that expanded and replaced the Unaffiliated Order by allowing the Group A Accounts, among others, and PGI to enter into and materially amend agreements with wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors (i.e., affiliated sub-advisors that are at least 95% owned, directly or indirectly, by PGI and/or an affiliated person of PGI) (the "Wholly-Owned Order"). However, each Group A Account's shareholders must approve any such Account's reliance on the expanded relief related to wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
      The Board proposes that shareholders of each Group A Account approve the proposal. The proposal would permit PGI, in its capacity as the investment manager to that Group A Account and subject to Board approval, to enter into and/or materially amend sub-advisory agreements with wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors (in addition to the already permitted unaffiliated sub-advisors) without obtaining shareholder approval pursuant to the Wholly-Owned Order. PGI could only do so if the Board concludes that the new or amended sub-advisory agreement would be in the best interests of such Group A Account and its shareholders.
(1) The Unaffiliated Order and Wholly-Owned Order order were granted to Principal Management Corporation ("PMC"), including PMC's successors (defined to mean an entity resulting from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with PMC or its successors. On May 1, 2017, PMC merged with and into PGI, both of which were indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFG and, therefore, under common control. All references to PGI in this Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 reflect the result of PMC's merger with and into its affiliate PGI.
Operation under the Wholly-Owned Order 
      If shareholders approve this Proposal 2, PGI will be permitted to hire, terminate, or replace unaffiliated or wholly-owned sub-advisors ("Eligible Sub-Advisors") and materially amend agreements with Eligible Sub-Advisors without obtaining shareholder approval. New sub-advisory agreements between PGI and an Eligible Sub-Advisor, and any material changes to such agreements, will require the approval of the Board, including the Independent Directors, as is the case today. The relief under the Wholly-Owned Order does not apply to the advisory agreement between PGI and any Group A Account, and material changes to such agreement would continue to require approval of shareholders. In accordance with the conditions of the Wholly-Owned Order, within 90 days of the hiring of an Eligible Sub-Advisor, shareholders will continue to be furnished essentially all information about the Eligible Sub-Advisor and sub-advisory agreement that would be required to be included in a proxy statement. Board Consideration in Approving Use of Wholly-Owned Order 
      The Board believes that it is in the best interests of each Group A Account and its shareholders to provide PGI and the Board with increased flexibility to select and contract with sub-advisors without incurring the significant delay and expense associated with obtaining shareholder approval. The Board believes that the additional flexibility under the Wholly-Owned Order would permit each Group A Account to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. Under the Unaffiliated Order, approval by the shareholders of sub-advisory agreements or material amendments thereto with respect to unaffiliated sub-advisors is not required. However, each Group A Account must currently call and hold a shareholder meeting before it appoints a new wholly-owned sub-advisor or materially amends a sub-advisory agreement with a wholly-owned sub-advisor. Each time a shareholder meeting is called, the relevant Group A Account must create and distribute proxy materials and solicit proxy votes from that Account's shareholders. This process is time consuming and costly, and such costs are sometimes borne by the Group A Account, thereby reducing shareholders' net investment returns. Additionally, approval of this Proposal 2 would permit PGI to act quickly in certain situations in which PGI and the Board (whose approval of all such matters will continue to be required) believes that a sub-advisor change or sub-advisory agreement change is warranted.
Required vote. Shareholders of each Group A Account will vote separately on this Proposal 2. As to any Group A Account, approval of the Wholly-Owned Order will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Account. If the required shareholder approval is not obtained by any Group A Account, such Group A Account will continue to be required to obtain shareholder approval to enter into and/or materially amend agreements with wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of each Group A Account vote "For"
the Proposal applicable to such Group A Account.

Background 
     The Group A Accounts, among others, and PGI have applied for a further order that would permit PGI to enter into and materially amend agreements with majority-owned affiliated sub-advisors (i.e., affiliated sub-advisors that are at least 50% owned, directly or indirectly, by PGI and/or an affiliated person of PGI) (the "Majority-Owned Order"). 
      The SEC has not issued the Majority-Owned Order to any Group A Account or PGI and there is no guarantee that such order will be granted. The Board, however, is proposing that the shareholders of each Group A Account approve a proposal to permit such Group A Account to operate pursuant to the Majority-Owned Order if and when granted. It is anticipated that such order, if granted, will impose various conditions that are the same or similar to those currently imposed on each Group A Account and PGI by the Wholly-Owned Order. As the Majority-Owned Order has not been issued, however, such terms and conditions may be different. This Proposal 3 requests approval of the use of the Majority-Owned Order under any terms or conditions that may be imposed by the SEC in the Majority-Owned Order. Each Group A Account anticipates that the manager-of-managers structure will operate  essentially in the same manner as under the Wholly-Owned Order, except that the expansion of such relief will also apply to majority-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
Board Consideration in Approving Reliance under Majority-Owned Order
      Similar to the consideration given by the Board in recommending the approval of the Wholly-Owned Order, the Board believes that expanding such relief to majority-owned sub-advisors is in the best interests of each Group A Account and its shareholders by providing PGI and the Board increased flexibility in selecting and contracting with sub-advisors without incurring the significant delay and expense associated with obtaining shareholder approval.
Required vote. Shareholders of each Group A Account will vote separately on this Proposal 3. As to any Group A Account, approval of the Majority-Owned Order will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Group A Account. If the required shareholder approval is not obtained by any Group A Account, and if the SEC grants the Majority-Owned Order, such Group A Account will continue to be required to obtain shareholder approval to enter into and/or materially amend agreements with majority-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of each Group A Account vote "For"
the Proposal applicable to such Group A Account.
PROPOSAL 4
APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT OF
CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
Introduction
      PVC has adopted certain investment policies for each Account, which it generally refers to as "investment restrictions," that can only be changed by a vote of shareholders. Such investment restrictions are considered "fundamental."  The 1940 Act requires that certain policies, including those dealing with the issuance of senior securities, purchasing or selling commodities or real estate, borrowing money and making loans, diversification, industry concentration, and underwriting securities of other issuers be fundamental, and the Board may elect to designate other policies as fundamental. 
Shareholders of certain Accounts are being asked to approve amendments to certain fundamental investment restrictions. The amendment to each investment restriction is set forth in a separate proposal below (Proposals 4(a) - 4(c)).
PGI has reviewed each of the current investment restrictions and has recommended to the Board that certain restrictions be amended. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify and simplify PVC's fundamental restrictions and to incorporate flexibility to accommodate future regulatory changes without the need for further shareholder action. Additionally, to reflect changes over time in industry practices and regulatory requirements, some of the proposed amendments update fundamental restrictions that are more restrictive than are required under the federal securities laws. 
The proposed amendments are not expected to have any material effect on the manner in which any Account is managed or on any Account's current principal investment objective(s). 
     The Board has concluded that the proposed amendments to the investment restrictions are appropriate and will benefit the Accounts and their shareholders. If approved by shareholders of an Account, each amended investment restriction will become effective as to that Account when PVC's Statement of Additional Information is revised or supplemented to reflect the amendment.
 Required vote. Shareholders of each Account will vote separately on each proposed amendment that applies to that Account. As to any Account, approval of each of Proposals 4(a) - 4(c) will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Account. If a proposed amendment is not approved by shareholders of an Account, the current investment restriction will remain in effect as to that Account.
The Board recommends that the shareholders of each Account vote "For"
each Proposal applicable to the Account. Organization of Proposals
     The amendment to each fundamental investment restriction is set forth in a separate proposal below (Proposals 4(a) - 4(c)). The Accounts that will vote on each proposal are identified under the caption for that proposal, and each proposal sets forth the proposed amended fundamental investment restriction as well as the restriction currently in effect. For each proposal, the term "Account" or "Accounts" refers to the Account or Accounts voting on the particular proposal.
PROPOSAL 4(a)
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDED FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTION 
RELATING TO COMMODITIES FOR THE ACCOUNT
(Each Account)
 Sections 8(b)(1)(F) and 13(a)(2) of the 1940 Act together require that each Account have a fundamental restriction dealing with the purchase or sale of commodities. The 1940 Act does not prohibit a fund from investing in commodities.
 Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Accounts indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to commodities:
 The Account may not purchase or sell commodities, except as permitted by applicable law, regulation or regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
 Current Restriction: Currently, each Account has a fundamental investment restriction relating to commodities that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
    "Each Account may not purchase or sell commodities, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
     Discussion of proposed amendment. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify that each Account's ability to purchase or sell commodities is limited by all laws applicable to such Account, not just the 1940 Act. Under the proposed restriction, if current applicable law changes, each Account could conform to such new law without shareholders taking further action.
Approval by any Account of the proposed amended restriction relating to commodities is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Account or affect the way the Account is currently managed or operated.

     Under the 1940 Act, a fund's policy regarding concentration of investments in the securities of companies in any particular industry must be fundamental. The staff of the SEC takes the position that any fund that invests more than 25% of its total assets in a particular industry (excluding the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities) is deemed to be "concentrated" in that industry.
 Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Accounts indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration:
 The Account may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time, its investments in a particular industry or group of industries.
 Current Restriction: Currently, the Accounts indicated above have a fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
     "Each Accounts may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, its investments in a particular industry, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
     Discussion of proposed amendment. Because the 1940 Act does not otherwise permit concentration, the exception stated in the current restriction is not meaningful. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify the  restriction by deleting such exception. Each Account currently has, and will continue to have, a fundamental investment restriction that prohibits the Account from concentrating its investments in any one industry.
Approval by an Account of the proposed amended restriction relating to concentration is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Account.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") has been selected as the independent registered public accounting firm for PVC for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and served as such for the last two fiscal years. The independent registered public accounting firm audits annual financial statements for PVC and reviews regulatory filings that include those financial statements. Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Meeting, have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to answer appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") has adopted the following policy regarding approval and pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditor").
* * *
The Principal Funds
Policy on Auditor Independence
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the independence of the Principal Funds' primary independent auditor.  This policy is established by the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Boards of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. and the Board of Trustees of Principal Exchange-Traded Funds (the "Funds") (the "Boards of the Funds") effective for all engagements of the primary independent auditor.
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. The primary independent auditor, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall not provide Prohibited Services to the Funds.  For the purposes of this policy, Prohibited Services are: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Services that are subject to audit procedure during a financial statement audit; 
• Services where the auditor would act on behalf of management; 
• Services where the auditor is an advocate to the client's position in an adversarial proceeding; 
• Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Funds, its subsidiaries and affiliates; 
• Financial information systems design and implementation; 
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports; 
• Actuarial services; 
• Internal audit functions or human resources; 
• Broker or dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services; 
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; 
• Tax planning services related to listed, confidential and aggressive transactions; 
• Personal tax planning services to individuals in a financial reporting oversight role with regard to the Funds (other than members of the Boards of the Funds who are not also officers of the Funds), including the immediate family members of such individuals; 
• Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) determines, by regulation, is impermissible. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. (A) All services the primary independent auditor, its subsidiaries and affiliates provide to the Funds, and (B) Audit services, including audits of annual financial statements, audits of acquired or divested businesses or review of regulatory filings, any independent auditor provides, shall be approved by the Committee in advance in accordance with the following procedure: 
[END TABLE]
Each quarter, Management will present to the Committee for pre-approval, a detailed description of each particular service, excluding tax services, for which pre-approval is sought and a range of fees for such service.  The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members provided such delegated member(s) shall present a report of any services approved to the full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.  The Committee Chairperson shall have pre-approval authority for changes to any range of fees applicable to services the Committee previously approved and for new services and the range of fees for such services that arise between regularly scheduled Committee meetings.
Similarly, the primary independent auditor will present to the Committee for pre-approval a written description of the nature and scope of all tax services not expressly prohibited, including the fee  arrangements for such services, and the potential effects of such services on the audit firm's independence.
In considering whether to pre-approve the primary independent auditor's provision of non-audit services, the Committee will consider whether the services are compatible with the maintenance of such auditor's independence.  The Committee will also consider whether the primary independent auditor is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Funds' business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance the Funds' ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality.
[BEGIN TABLE]
3. The provisions of this policy shall apply to all audit and non-audit services provided directly to the Funds.  Additionally, the provisions of this policy shall apply to non-audit services provided to Principal Global Investors, LLC ("PGI") or an affiliate of PGI that provides ongoing services to the Funds if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds. 
[END TABLE]

OTHER MATTERS
PVC does not know of any matters to be presented at the Meeting other than those mentioned in this Proxy Statement.  If any other matters properly come before the Meeting, the shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies.
PVC is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and, therefore, cannot determine when the next meeting of shareholders will be held.

Only one copy of this Proxy Statement may be mailed to households, even if more than one person in a household is an Account shareholder of record, unless PVC has received instructions to the contrary. If you need additional copies of this Proxy Statement, or if you do not want the mailing of a Proxy Statement to be combined with those for other members of your household in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would rather receive just one copy for the household, please contact the Shareholder Services Department toll free at 1-800-222-5852 or by writing to PVC at P.O. Box 219971, Kansas City, MO 64121-9971. PVC will promptly deliver, upon request, a separate copy of this Proxy Statement to any shareholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed.

AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
PRINCIPAL FUNDS1 
Audit Committee Charter (Amended March 13, 2018)
This charter sets forth the purpose, operating guidelines and responsibilities of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Boards of Directors/Trustees of the Principal Funds (the "Funds"). The Committee reviews the charter at least annually.
Purpose
The primary purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling certain of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee serves as an independent and objective party to monitor the Funds' accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control system, as well as the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee assists Board oversight of (1) the integrity of the Funds' financial statements; (2) the Funds' compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements;2 (3) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; and (4) the performance of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also serves to provide an open avenue of communication among the independent registered public accounting firm, the Manager's internal auditors, Fund management, and the Board.
The Committee's role is limited to oversight. Fund management is responsible for preparing the Funds' financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and for establishing and maintaining appropriate systems for accounting, reporting and internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for conducting an audit of the Funds' financial statements in accordance with applicable legal and professional standards, including the standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
Although the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Funds' financial statements are complete and accurate and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nothing in this charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of the Funds' service providers, including the independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Funds' Board and the Committee.
Operating Guidelines
The Board shall appoint the members of the Committee and the Committee's Chair. Members of the Committee may not be interested persons of the Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The number of Committee members shall satisfy each of the securities exchanges on which the Funds offers shares. In addition, a member of the Committee may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Committee, the Board or any other board committee, accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Funds or any affiliate of the Funds.
Each member of the Committee shall be financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted by the Funds' Board in its business judgment. At least one member of the Committee must have accounting or related financial management expertise, as the Board interprets such qualification in its business judgment. The Board will determine whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR.
____________________
1 Includes Principal Funds, Inc., Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. and Principal Exchange-Traded Funds
2 The Board has delegated to other committees oversight of various legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee's function is limited to the activities set forth in this charter.
B-1
There shall be four regular meetings of the Committee each year. In conjunction with these meetings, the Committee shall meet in private executive sessions. The Committee or its Chair may call additional meetings as each deems appropriate. The Committee shall meet periodically, in separate executive sessions, with representatives of Fund Management, the Manager's internal auditors and the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee may also request to meet with internal legal counsel and compliance personnel of the Manager and with personnel of entities that provide significant accounting or administrative services to the Funds to discuss matters relating to the Funds' accounting and compliance as well as other Fund-related matters.
Except as provided by law, the following provisions shall govern the conduct of Committee meetings:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Notice. Notice shall be given as provided for meetings of the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Principal Funds. 
• Quorum. At any Committee meeting a majority of the Committee members then in office shall constitute a quorum. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. 
• Action by Vote. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of Committee members may take any action. 
• Action by Writing. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any Committee meeting may be taken without a meeting if all of the Committee members consent to the action in writing and such written consents are filed with the records of the meetings of the Committee. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote taken at a Committee meeting. 
• Presence Through Communications Equipment. The members of the Committee may participate in a Committee meeting by means of a conference telephone, or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. 
• Minutes. Minutes of the meeting shall be taken and circulated to all members of the Committee in a timely manner. 
[END TABLE]

Principal Financial Group's whistleblower procedures are intended to empower employees and others to confidentially and anonymously report any unethical employee behavior, and those procedures will be used to facilitate the identification by the Principal Financial Group's Chief Internal Auditor and the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer of complaint information for the Audit Committee's review.
