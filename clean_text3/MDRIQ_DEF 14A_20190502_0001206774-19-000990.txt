Letter to Stockholders
To My Fellow Stockholders:
2018 was without a doubt a memorable and transformational year for McDermott. On May 10, 2018, we completed our business combination (the "Combination") with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V ("CB&I") to create a top-tier, technology-led, integrated provider of engineering and construction solutions for the energy industry. Today, we are a fundamentally different and much larger company, as compared to where we were at the end of 2017, with a formidable new presence in significant onshore markets.
Our focus areas for 2018 were to:
While we achieved significant integration, strategic and operational accomplishments aligned with the above focus areas in 2018, the year was not without difficulty, with substantial charges incurred with respect to certain legacy CB&I projects impacting our financial results. McDermott's Board and executive management team have taken significant remedial measures to address performance issues on those projects, and with integration now largely complete, we are acutely focused on ensuring that operating performance across the entire portfolio meets our standard of excellence in execution.
Given the exceptional circumstances presented by the Combination, special considerations impacted our 2018 executive compensation programs, which were thoughtfully structured to align with the above focus areas and drive our operational and financial performance as a combined company over the long-term. As further detailed in the compensation discussion and analysis section of this proxy statement, in making compensation decisions for 2018, the Compensation Committee retained its philosophy in providing compensation that (1) attracts, motivates and retains high-performing executives, (2) provides performance-based incentives to reward achievement of short and long-term business goals and strategic objectives while recognizing individual contributions and (3) aligns the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. In part due to our 2018 executive compensation programs, we have been able to build a strong global executive team, which is acutely focused on creating value for our stockholders.
Just as McDermott as a company has transformed since 2017, so has the composition of our Board. In May 2018 with the closing of the Combination, we increased the size of our Board from nine to eleven members and welcomed five new, experienced and qualified independent directors: Messrs. Forbes I.J. Alexander, L. Richard Flury, W. Craig Kissel, James H. Miller and Ms. Marsha C. Williams. Each director on our Board brings the right mix of skills, experience, knowledge and independence that we believe will best position the Board for effective decision-making and risk oversight in supporting our long-term strategy. Additionally, our post-Combination Board remains firmly committed to continuing our thoughtful, forward-looking and stockholder informed approach to corporate governance, which is of upmost importance to McDermott.
Looking forward to 2019, our end markets are growing. We are continuing to see recovery in the offshore and subsea, LNG and downstream markets, with the highest McDermott revenue opportunity pipeline in our history. Today, McDermott is well-positioned to offer the technology-led, vertically-integrated solutions that we know our customers are seeking. We believe that McDermott has the right strategy in place to play a major role in the next chapter of global energy solutions.
I am pleased to invite you to attend McDermott's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The accompanying Proxy Statement further highlights key activities and accomplishments in 2018 and contains information on the matters for which we are seeking your vote at this year's Annual Meeting. On behalf of the Board, our executive management team, and the entire McDermott organization, thank you for your continued interest and support, as we seek to leverage the momentum of the Combination, continue to combine our strengths and realize the potential 2019 has to offer.
Sincerely yours,

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
On May 10, 2018, McDermott completed its combination (the "Combination") with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. ("CB&I"). The completion of the Combination represented the culmination of a multi-year process through which McDermott's Board of Directors and executive management team considered both organic and inorganic strategies to increase the size and scale of the organization. The result of the Combination is the creation of a transformed company: a premier, fully integrated, global engineering, procurement, construction and installation ("EPCI") provider, with product solutions spanning onshore and offshore from concept to commissioning. Today, we are a fundamentally different and much larger company as compared to where we were at the end of 2017, with significant earnings potential as provided below:
Under the continued leadership of our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Dickson, our post-Combination 2018 operating strategy was to pioneer a new kind of company, with a focus on the following strategic objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Complete the integration with CB&I successfully to establish a top tier, vertically integrated engineering, procurement and construction company, competitively differentiated in technology, customer relationships, culture and geographic footprint  Drive savings throughout the organization and embody a best in class culture, with a focus on achieving synergy savings via the Combination Profitability Initiative, or CPI  Develop strategy to position McDermott for future growth by capitalizing on a robust revenue opportunity pipeline and growing end markets  Exercise disciplined bidding through thorough evaluation and assessment of project risk profiles  Deliver excellence in execution through implementation of the One McDermott Way mcdermott.com             9

2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS
The Compensation Committee is committed to targeting reasonable and competitive total direct compensation, or "TDC", for our NEOs, with a significant portion of that compensation being performance based. Our compensation programs are designed to align with and drive achievement of our business strategies and provide competitive opportunities. Accordingly, achievement of most of those opportunities depends on the attainment of performance goals and/or stock price performance. McDermott's compensation programs are designed to provide compensation that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Attracts, motivates and retains high-performing executives  Provides performance-based incentives to reward achievement of short and long-term business goals and strategic objectives while recognizing individual contributions  Aligns the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has designed and administered compensation programs aligned with this philosophy and is committed to continued outreach to stockholders to understand and address comments on our compensation programs.
Reflecting this philosophy, our NEO compensation arrangements in 2018 provided for the continuing use of three elements of TDC: annual base salary; annual incentive provided under our Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, or EICP; and long-term incentives, or LTI.
In consideration of the anticipated Combination, in making compensation decisions for 2018, the Compensation Committee bifurcated the year into pre-Combination and post-Combination periods. For the pre-Combination period, the Compensation Committee deferred any significant changes to the elements of executive officer target TDC. Instead, the Compensation Committee generally maintained consistency with 2017 compensation levels for each element of target TDC, but only awarded 50% of 2017 target LTI award values, in the form of Restricted Stock Units, for the pre-Combination period.
Following the completion of the Combination, the newly constituted Compensation Committee, which now includes former CB&I directors as members, met to consider executive officer compensation. In determining the appropriate plan design and levels of compensation, the Compensation Committee took into consideration a number of factors, including the significantly increased size and scale, newly established operating strategy and short- and long-term goals of McDermott. As a result of this review, the Compensation Committee approved the following elements of executive officer compensation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual base salary increases provided to align with market median  
● Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Identified as Financial Performance Metrics 
● Target EICP award increases provided to align with market median 
● 50% of 2018 Target LTI Awarded as Performance Units 
● Additional Restricted Stock Units awarded to achieve 50% of 2018 Target LTI 
● Target LTI award value increases to align with market median
 10             2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
In selecting performance metrics and performance levels for the elements of annual and long-term compensation for both the pre- and post-Combination periods, the Compensation Committee sought to support McDermott's strategic and financial goals and drive the creation of stockholder value. Specifically, the Compensation Committee considered McDermott's strategic objectives in determining financial metrics for executive compensation, as set forth below.

In addition, our Code of Business Conduct may be found on the corporate governance section of our Web site.
Unless otherwise directed, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card intend to vote "FOR" the election of each of the nominees. If any nominee should become unavailable for election, the shares will be voted for such substitute nominee as may be proposed by our Board of Directors. However, we are not aware of any circumstances that would prevent any of the nominees from serving.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR each of the nominees named below. 
[END TABLE]
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that, at each annual meeting of stockholders, all directors shall be elected annually for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

Our Governance Committee has determined that a candidate for election to our Board of Directors must meet specific minimum qualifications. Each candidate should:
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines place limits on the number of boards on which McDermott directors may serve. Such limits provide that any director who is a chief executive officer or other senior executive of a public company should serve on no more than two public company boards, and any other director should serve on no more than three public company boards, in both instances including the McDermott Board. Any proposed service in excess of these limits will be considered on a case by case basis.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 22             2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
In addition, the Governance Committee also considers it desirable that candidates contribute positively to the collaborative culture among Board members and possess professional and personal experiences and expertise relevant to our business and industry. The Governance Committee solicits ideas for possible candidates from a number of sources, including independent director candidate search firms, members of the Board and our senior level executives.
The Board recognizes the benefits of a diversified board and believes that any search for potential director candidates should consider diversity as to gender, race, ethnic background and personal and professional experiences. Additionally, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any independent director search firm retained to assist the Governance Committee in identifying director candidates shall seek to include diverse candidates in terms of race, ethnic background and gender.
The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards require our Board of Directors to be comprised of at least a majority of independent directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board be comprised entirely of independent directors. For a director to be considered independent, our Board must determine that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with us. To assist it in determining director independence, and as permitted by NYSE rules then in effect, the Board previously established categorical standards which conform to, or are more exacting than, the independence requirements in the NYSE listing standards. These standards are contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can be found on our Web site at www.mcdermott.com under "INVESTORS – Corporate Governance."
Based on these independence standards, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent and meet our categorical independence standards:
In determining the independence of the directors, our Board considered ordinary course transactions between us and other entities with which the directors are associated, none of which were determined to constitute a material relationship with us. Messrs. Alexander, Barril, Bookout, Flury, Kissel, Luquette and Schumann have no relationship with McDermott, except as a director and stockholder. Mr. Miller, Ms. Shafer-Malicki and Ms. Williams are directors of entities with which we transact business in the ordinary course. Our Board also considered contributions by us to charitable organizations with which the directors were associated. No director is related to any executive or significant stockholder of McDermott, nor is any director, with the exception of Mr. Dickson, a current or former employee of McDermott.
Any stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as one of our directors at the annual meeting of stockholders if the stockholder complies with the notice, information and consent provisions contained in our By-Laws. See "Stockholders' Proposals" in this proxy statement and our By-Laws, which may be found on our Web site at www.mcdermott.com at "INVESTORS – Corporate Governance."
The Governance Committee will consider candidates identified through the processes described above and will evaluate the candidates, including incumbents, based on the same criteria. The Governance Committee also takes into account the contributions of incumbent directors as Board members and the benefits to us arising from their experience on the Board. Although the Governance Committee will consider candidates identified by stockholders, the Governance Committee has sole discretion whether to recommend those candidates to the Board.

THE BOARD'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board's Key Responsibilities include:
As part of its oversight function, the Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management through our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") program, which includes periodic reporting through an area and corporate ERM structure. In connection with the ERM program, the Board exercises its oversight responsibility with respect to key external, strategic, operational and financial risks and discusses the effectiveness of current efforts to mitigate certain focus risks as identified by senior management and the Board through anonymous risk surveys.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 FULL BOARD 
 Although the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, the Board is assisted in discharging its risk oversight responsibility by the Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees. Each committee oversees management of risks, including, but not limited to, the areas of risk summarized below, and periodically reports to the Board on those areas of risk: 
 Audit Committee   Compensation Committee   Governance Committee 
 Oversees management of risks related to our financial statements and the financial reporting process   Oversees management of risks related to our compensation policies and practices applicable to executives, employee benefit plans and the administration of equity plans   Oversees management of risks related to succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other members of executive management and our Ethics and Compliance Program (excluding responsibilities assigned to the Audit Committee)

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
At their respective November 2018 meetings, each committee undertook an assessment of those areas of risk oversight that were delegated to it and provided a report to the Board. Also, at its November 2018 meeting, the Board received an ERM report and performed an assessment and review of the risks described in that report that were not delegated to the committees.
Regarding risks relating to the design of our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee, with assistance from its independent compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, regularly reviews and assesses our compensation policies and practices to ensure that they are appropriate in terms of the level of risk-taking and in line with our business strategies and the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee has designed our compensation programs to encourage performance focused on long-term stockholder value, promote company growth and allow for appropriate levels of risk-taking but to discourage excessive risk-taking. Based on the findings of the risk assessment performed at its November 2018 meeting, the Compensation Committee concluded that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are aligned with stockholders' interests and are not reasonably likely to have a materially adverse impact on us.
In an effort to continuously improve our governance and compensation practices, our Board is firmly committed to constructive engagement with our stockholders and regularly reviews and responds to their expressed views.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Objective     Outreach     Discussion     Feedback     Results 
 In 2015, our Board established a formal and extensive shareholder outreach program, under which members of our Board and/or executive management team solicit feedback from our stockholders on our governance processes and compensation programs.   In both the spring and fall of each year, we typically reach out to stockholders representing approximately 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock and other stakeholders to discuss their perspectives on corporate governance and compensation matters.   In person or telephonic meetings have been led by either our Governance Committee Chair or Compensation Committee Chair. In 2018, based on improvements to our governance and compensation programs and positive say-on-pay results since 2016, no meetings were requested by stockholders to discuss those programs, which we believe is an indication of our stockholders' support of our current governance and compensation framework.   This engagement process has provided us with constructive stockholder feedback on governance and compensation topics, such as board refreshment, board evaluations, annual and long-term incentive programs and disclosure around our executive compensation programs.   Each year, our Board considers the say on pay vote result and the matters discussed during the stockholder and stakeholder outreach efforts conducted during the year in considering any changes or enhancements to our governance and compensation practices.

We are committed to a strong board refreshment process. As part of our commitment to board refreshment we impose a mandatory director retirement age of 72, require Committee Chairs to rotate after five years of service and annually review committee composition and individual director skills and qualifications. Further, our Governance Committee, typically with the assistance of a third party search firm, identifies and considers new director candidates who have expertise that would complement and enhance the current Board's skills and experience. Additionally, with the closing of the Combination in May 2018, we welcomed five new, experienced and qualified members to our Board. Our commitment to board refreshment has resulted in a Board with a well-balanced tenure.

 Succession Planning     Identification of Candidates     Meeting with Candidates     Decision and Nomination 
 The Governance Committee implements an ongoing succession planning process, seeking out director candidates to join our Board in light of the emerging needs of our business and our current Board's composition.   To ensure a robust search process and access to a wide range of qualified candidates, the Governance Committee works closely with an independent search firm to identify and evaluate director candidates in light of our Board's structure, tenure and qualifications.   Potential director candidates are interviewed by our Chair of the Board, CEO, the Governance Committee and other available directors.   The Governance Committee recommends to the full Board for nomination those director candidates with the skills and experience that would most benefit the current Board and best serve the interests of McDermott and its stockholders. 
   Voting 
 The Director nominees stand for election  or reelection to the Board by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, each for a term extending until the next year's Annual  Meeting of Stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
Our Board recognizes the critical role of annual Board and committee evaluations in ensuring the Board and each committee are functioning effectively. The Governance Committee annually reviews the Board and committee evaluation process in consideration of recent best practices and input from the directors. To that end, and in response to stockholder input received through our stockholder outreach efforts, the Governance Committee enhanced the evaluation process by utilizing a third party to help conduct the annual Board and committee performance evaluations conducted in early 2017.
Based on stockholder input, the results of the 2017 evaluations and consistent with the practices of many other companies who retain third-party facilitators to assist with their annual evaluations, the Governance Committee determined that it would be more beneficial to utilize a third party to help conduct the annual evaluations once every few years and as needed as opposed to every year. In 2019, in accordance with its charter, the Governance Committee oversaw the annual evaluation process, solicited feedback from all directors and reported to the Board with an assessment of the performance of the Board and its committees. This assessment was then discussed and taken into account by the full Board in executive session in its consideration of any appropriate action or response that might strengthen director communications and the overall effectiveness of Board and committee meetings.

Progress in 2018
In 2018, McDermott approved a Social Responsibility Policy, outlining our commitment to respecting people, the environment, and communities in our global operations. We are improving our CSR/Sustainability framework in line with international standards, such as the ISO 26000 standard, and have started mapping our activities and contributions with the Sustainable Development Goals. By using these international standards as guidance, we are better positioned to further define the sustainability issues material to our business and develop sustainability goals for our company moving forward.
We are already making progress across a broad range of sustainability initiatives. We now have a formal CSR Corporate Steering Committee and Global Coordination Team to more closely align CSR activities to our business objectives, which will promote shared value for our stakeholders. We are also building a Sustainability Community of Practice to increase collaboration among subject matter experts and encourage innovation and the development of sustainable solutions. In 2018, we held a global sustainability summit aimed to bring together employees and subject-matter experts from across functions and areas to share knowledge and expertise.
In 2018, we also continued our commitment to "Taking the Lead with QHSES," an internally driven program focused on proactively developing and supporting the behaviors and attitudes that lead to a robust quality, health, safety, environment and security ("QHSES") culture and excellence in QHSES performance.

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Mr. Luquette has served as Chair of the Board since May 6, 2014. Our Board believes that it is appropriate for McDermott to have a Chair of the Board separate from the Chief Executive Officer, as this structure allows Mr. Dickson, McDermott's President and Chief Executive Officer, to maintain his focus on our strategic direction and the management of our day-to-day operations and performance, while Mr. Luquette is able to set the Board's agendas and lead the Board meetings.
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS
Our independent directors meet in executive session without management on a regular basis. Currently, Mr. Luquette, our Chair of the Board of Directors, serves as the presiding director for those executive sessions.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES
Our Board met 11 times during 2018. All directors serving on the Board during 2018 attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which they served during 2018. Additionally, it is our policy that all of our directors make reasonable efforts to attend our annual meeting of stockholders and, in accordance with that policy, 10 of our 11 directors serving on the Board at the time attended our 2018 Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 BOARD COMMITTEES 
[END TABLE]
Our Board currently has, and appoints the members of, standing Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees. Each standing Board committee is comprised entirely of independent nonemployee directors and has a written charter approved by the Board. The current charter for each standing Board committee is posted on our Web site at www.mcdermott.com under "INVESTORS – Corporate Governance – Board Committee Charters." Attendance at committee meetings is open to every director, regardless of whether he or she is a member of the committee. Occasionally, our Board may convene joint meetings of certain committees and the Board. Each portion of the joint meeting is counted separately for purposes of the number of meetings of the Board and its committees disclosed in this proxy statement. Additionally, in 2018, in connection with the Combination, the Board determined it necessary and appropriate to establish a Transition Committee to oversee and support efforts to effectively and efficiently integrate the two companies post-Combination.

All members of our Compensation Committee are independent in accordance with NYSE listing standards. No member of the Compensation Committee (1) was, during the year ended December 31, 2018, or had previously been, an officer or employee of McDermott or any of its subsidiaries, or (2) had any material interest in a transaction of McDermott or a business relationship with, or any indebtedness to, McDermott. No interlocking relationship existed during the year ended December 31, 2018 between any member of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and an executive officer of McDermott.
RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
We have adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy applicable to any individual transaction or series of related-person transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● McDermott or any of its subsidiaries is, was or will be a participant; 
● any related person (as defined in the policy) has, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest; and 
● the amount involved exceeds $120,000. 
[END TABLE]
This policy requires directors, director nominees and executive officers to provide written notice to the Chief Legal Officer ("CLO") of any potential related person transaction involving, directly or indirectly, him or her or any of his or her immediate family members. Additionally, each director, director nominee and executive officer must complete an annual questionnaire designed in part to elicit and evaluate information about potential related-person transactions and any related-person relationships. All related-person transactions requiring compliance with the policy as determined by the CLO must be presented to the Governance Committee for review, approval, ratification or other action. The Governance Committee will approve or ratify a related-person transaction only if it determines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is not inconsistent with

the best interests of McDermott. We employ Mr. L. Richard Flury's son, Geoffrey Flury, as director of quality operations at our Walker, Louisiana operations. Mr. L. Richard Flury is a member of the Board as well as Chair of the Governance Committee and a member of the Compensation Committee. The Governance Committee, with Mr. Flury abstaining, determined that this relationship does not affect Mr. Flury's independence because Geoffrey Flury is not an executive officer and received his compensation solely for service as an employee. There were no other such transactions found to be directly or indirectly material to a related person required by SEC rules to be disclosed in this proxy statement.
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Under our 2018 nonemployee director compensation program, cash compensation for nonemployee directors consisted of retainers (paid monthly and prorated for partial terms) and meeting fees as follows:
In 2018, we made certain changes to our nonemployee director compensation program as a result of the increased size and scale of McDermott following the Combination. Our independent compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, performed a competitive review of our nonemployee director compensation program relative to a group of post-Combination peer companies, which showed that our nonemployee director compensation levels were below our peer median. Accordingly, Meridian recommended adjustments to reduce the gap relative to our post-Combination peers. Based on information provided by Meridian, the Governance Committee approved the following changes to our nonemployee director compensation program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Increase in the annual Board member retainer from $85,000 to $120,000; 
● Increase the Governance Committee Chair retainer from $10,000 to $15,000; 
● Increase the annual restricted stock award from $135,000 to $150,000. 
[END TABLE]
Even with these increases, our nonemployee director compensation levels remain below the peer median. Additionally, McDermott will assume any tax liabilities incurred by any nonemployee director in the United Kingdom as a result of our establishment of tax residency in the United Kingdom.

CD&A EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
McDermott is a premier, fully integrated provider of technology, engineering and construction solutions to the energy industry. We design and build end-to-end infrastructure and technology solutions to transport and transform oil and gas into the products the world needs today. Our proprietary technologies, integrated expertise and comprehensive solutions deliver certainty, innovation and added value to energy projects around the world. Operating in over 54 countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, our locally focused and globally-integrated resources include approximately 40,000 employees and engineers, a diversified fleet of specialty marine construction vessels and fabrication facilities around the world. As an industry leader in the technology space, McDermott offers licensed process technologies, catalysts, specialized equipment and engineered products for use in petrochemical facilities, oil refineries and gas processing plants.
On May 10, 2018, McDermott completed its combination (the "Combination") with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. ("CB&I"). The completion of the Combination represented the culmination of a multi-year process through which McDermott's Board of Directors and executive management team considered both organic and inorganic strategies to increase the size and scale of the organization. The result of the Combination is the creation of a transformed company: a premier, fully integrated, global engineering, procurement, construction and installation ("EPCI") provider, with product solutions spanning onshore and offshore from concept to commissioning. Today, we are a fundamentally different and much larger company as compared to where we were at the end of 2017, with significant earnings potential as provided below:
Under the continued leadership of our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Dickson, our post-Combination 2018 operating strategy was to pioneer a new kind of company, with a focus on the following strategic objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Complete the integration with CB&I successfully to establish a top tier, vertically integrated engineering, procurement and construction company, competitively differentiated in technology, customer relationships, culture and geographic footprint  Drive savings throughout the organization and embody a best in class culture, with a focus on achieving synergy savings via the Combination Profitability Initiative, or CPI  Develop strategy to position McDermott for future growth by capitalizing on a robust revenue opportunity pipeline and growing end markets  Exercise disciplined bidding through thorough evaluation and assessment of project risk profiles  Deliver excellence in execution through implementation of the One McDermott Way

Compensation Philosophy
The Compensation Committee is committed to targeting reasonable and competitive total direct compensation, or "TDC", for our NEOs, with a significant portion of that compensation being performance based. Our compensation programs are designed to align with and drive achievement of our business strategies and provide competitive opportunities. Accordingly, achievement of most of those opportunities depends on the attainment of performance goals and/or stock price performance. McDermott's compensation programs are designed to provide compensation that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Attracts, motivates and retains high-performing executives  Provides performance-based incentives to reward achievement of short and long-term business goals and strategic objectives while recognizing individual contributions  Aligns the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has designed and administered compensation programs aligned with this philosophy and is committed to continued outreach to stockholders to understand and address comments on our compensation programs.
2018 Compensation Program
Reflecting this philosophy, our NEO compensation arrangements in 2018 provided for the continuing use of three elements of TDC: annual base salary; annual incentive provided under our Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, or EICP; and long-term incentives, or LTI.
In consideration of the anticipated Combination, in making compensation decisions for 2018, the Compensation Committee bifurcated the year into pre-Combination and post-Combination periods. For the pre-Combination period, the Compensation Committee deferred any significant changes to the elements of executive officer target TDC. Instead, the Compensation Committee generally maintained consistency with 2017 compensation levels for each element of target TDC, but only awarded 50% of 2017 target LTI award values, in the form of Restricted Stock Units, for the pre-Combination period.
Following the completion of the Combination, the newly constituted Compensation Committee, which now includes former CB&I directors as members, met to consider executive officer compensation. In determining the appropriate plan design and levels of compensation, the Compensation Committee took into consideration a number of factors, including the significantly increased size and scale, newly established operating strategy and short- and long-term goals of McDermott. As a result of this review, the Compensation Committee approved the following elements of executive officer compensation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual base salary increases provided to align with market median● Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Identified as Financial Performance Metrics● Target EICP award increases provided to align with market median● 50% of 2018 Target LTI Awarded as Performance Units● Additional Restricted Stock Units awarded to achieve 50% of 2018 Target LTI● Target LTI award value increases to align with market median

In selecting performance metrics and performance levels for the elements of annual and long-term compensation for both the pre- and post-Combination periods, the Compensation Committee sought to support McDermott's strategic and financial goals, and drive the creation of stockholder value. Specifically, the Compensation Committee considered McDermott's strategic objectives in determining financial metrics for executive compensation, as set forth below.

2018 Performance
McDermott's most significant achievement in 2018 was the completion of the Combination, which transformed the company and positioned McDermott as a premier, fully integrated global provider of technology and EPCI solutions for the energy industry. As a result, McDermott's scale has significantly grown, with year-over-year revenues increased by 128%, backlog nearly tripling to the highest backlog of the company in its recent past and substantial order intake to provide future earnings potential.
McDermott also achieved the following noteworthy integration, strategic and operational accomplishments in 2018:
In evaluating the performance of David Dickson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, the Board considered the relatively short time frame post-Combination in which McDermott was able to achieve these notable strategic and operational achievements under Mr. Dickson's leadership. The Compensation Committee believes that Mr. Dickson has succeeded in positioning McDermott for significant long-term growth, while maintaining and strengthening customer and stakeholder relationships and establishing and promoting a strong culture for post-Combination McDermott.
Pay for Performance Alignment
Notwithstanding McDermott's achievements in 2018, the company experienced a declining stock price that severely impacted the value of Mr. Dickson's long-term incentives as of December 31, 2018, as shown in the graphic below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   $6.4 million

This significant reduction in value exhibits McDermott's pay-for-performance philosophy and the alignment of our compensation programs with the interests of our stockholders.

2018 Stockholder Say on Pay Vote
In 2018, over 96% of our stockholders voted in favor of our executive compensation program. During both the Spring and Fall of 2018, in advance of our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we reached out to stockholders representing approximately 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock and other stakeholders to gain insight regarding their perspectives on corporate governance and compensation matters. Based on recent improvements to our governance and compensation practices and positive say-on-pay results, no meetings were requested by our stockholders to discuss these topics, which we believe is an indication of our stockholders' support of our current compensation and governance framework. Our Board considered the 2018 say on pay vote and the matters discussed during our 2018 stockholder and stakeholder outreach efforts in considering any changes or enhancements to our governance and compensation practices.

2018 COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Target Total Direct Compensation
The Compensation Committee seeks to provide reasonable and competitive compensation. As a result, it targets the elements of total direct compensation, or "TDC," for our NEOs generally within approximately 15% of the median compensation of our market for comparable positions, which it considers to be "market range" compensation.
The Compensation Committee may set TDC or individual elements of TDC above or below the market range to account for a NEO's performance, experience, tenure in the role, internal pay equity and other factors or situations that are not typically captured by looking at standard market data and practices and which the Compensation Committee deems relevant to the appropriateness or competitiveness of a NEO's compensation.
When making decisions regarding individual compensation elements, the Compensation Committee also considers the effect on the NEO's target TDC and target total cash-based compensation (annual base salary and annual incentives at target level), as applicable. The Compensation Committee's goal is to establish target compensation for each element that, when combined, creates a target TDC award for each NEO that is reasonable and competitive and supports our compensation philosophy and objectives.
Elements of Total Direct Compensation
Total direct compensation is comprised of three elements: annual base salary, annual incentive and long-term incentives.
ANNUAL BASE SALARY
We pay base salaries to provide a fixed level of compensation that helps attract and retain executives. Base salary levels recognize an executive officer's experience, skill and performance, with the goal of being market competitive based on the officer's role and responsibilities within the organization. Adjustments may be made based on individual performance, inflation, pay relative to the external market and internal pay equity considerations.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE
The Compensation Committee administers our annual incentive compensation program under our Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, or EICP. The EICP is a cash incentive plan designed to motivate and reward our NEOs and other key employees for their contributions to strategic business goals and other factors that we believe drive our earnings and promote creation of stockholder value. In 2018, EICP bonus pool funding was entirely based on our financial performance, with each participant's actual bonus award determined by achievement of the participant's individual performance goals.
2018 Financial Performance Goals and Financial Performance Results. In consideration of the anticipated Combination, in 2018 the Compensation Committee bifurcated the EICP design among pre- and post-Combination periods.
For the pre-Combination period, the Compensation Committee approved Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, weighted 50% each, as financial metrics under the EICP. The pre-Combination financial metric performance goals were established with consideration of management's internal forecast of Legacy McDermott's 2018 financial results through April 30, 2018, and were utilized to determine the EICP pool funding multiple for the pre-Combination period.
For the post-Combination period, the Compensation Committee continued the use of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures), weighted 50% each, as the financial metrics under the EICP. The post-Combination financial metric performance goals were established with consideration of management's internal forecast of McDermott's 2018 financial results from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 and were utilized to determine the EICP pool funding multiple for the post-Combination period.
In approving the EICP design for each of the pre- and post-Combination periods, the Compensation Committee determined that the EICP pool funding multiple for each respective period will not be less than 0.5x nor more than 2.0x, and that the Compensation Committee has the discretion to increase or decrease the EICP pool funding multiple at any time in its sole discretion (subject to the maximum EICP pool funding of 2.0x).
[BEGIN TABLE]
 mcdermott.com             49 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
McDermott's actual performance (including Legacy McDermott only for the pre-Combination period) against the stated goals determines the funding multiple for each financial metric performance goal, with the sum of the weighted funding multiples determining the EICP pool funding for each of the pre- and post-Combination periods.
As a result of the EICP pool funding multiple determined above, each NEO, with the exception of Mr. Mukherjee, was eligible to earn 1.952x of his target EICP award for the pre-Combination period, and 0.5x of his target EICP award for the post-Combination period, subject to modification by the Compensation Committee, based on his achievement of individual performance goals. Due to Mr. Mukherjee's employment with McDermott beginning during the post-Combination period on July 3, 2018, Mr. Mukherjee was eligible to earn 0.5x of his target EICP award, subject to modification by the Compensation Committee, based on his achievement of individual performance goals.
Individual Performance Goals. Following the determination of the EICP pool funding multiple, each individual participant's award was determined based on the achievement of the participant's individual performance goals. The Compensation Committee had the discretion to decrease the amount of payout to any participant based on his or her performance against his or her individual performance goals.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
The Compensation Committee believes that the interests of our stockholders are best served when a significant percentage of executive compensation is comprised of equity that appreciates in value contingent on increases in the value of our common stock and other performance measures that reflect improvements in McDermott's business fundamentals. Therefore, LTI compensation represents the single largest element of our NEOs' total direct compensation.
As with the EICP, in consideration of the anticipated Combination, the Compensation Committee bifurcated 2018 LTI awards among the pre- and post-Combination periods, primarily to allow the post-Combination Compensation Committee the opportunity to determine target LTI award amounts, allocation among types of LTI awards and financial metrics for performance-based awards that were more appropriate for the post-Combination McDermott and in alignment with our stockholder interests over the long term.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 50             2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Specifically, in the pre-Combination period, the Compensation Committee awarded only restricted stock units, or RSUs, with the value of such awards being based on 50% of each NEO's 2017 target LTI award, with the exception of Messrs. Mukherjee and Prescott. Because Mr. Mukherjee's employment with McDermott began on July 3, 2018, he did not receive an LTI award during the pre-Combination period. Because Mr. Prescott's employment with McDermott began on January 8, 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded him RSUs valued at 50% of the 2017 target LTI for similarly situated executive officers.
In the post-Combination period, as expected, the Compensation Committee reassessed the target LTI award amounts and the allocation among types of LTI awards and awarded Performance Units and additional RSUs, maintaining an allocation of 2018 target LTI awards to the NEOs as follows:
Performance Units. Performance units are intended to align the NEOs' interests with those of our stockholders, with a focus on long-term results. The number of performance units awarded in 2018 which will ultimately be earned and vest, if any, will be determined with (1) 50% based on aggregate consolidated order intake for the performance period from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, and (2) 50% based on McDermott's relative total shareholder return as compared to the Performance Peer Group (as defined on page 53 of this CD&A) for the performance period from May 10, 2018 through December 31, 2020.
The Compensation Committee identified order intake as a performance metric for 50% of the 2018 performance unit awards based on its belief that this metric ties specifically to McDermott's strategy of positioning itself for future growth by capitalizing on its robust revenue opportunity pipeline and growing end markets. The Compensation Committee also believes the performance units should remain highly sensitive to McDermott's stock price, in order to further align management's interests with those of our stockholders, and, accordingly, identified relative total shareholder return as the performance metric for the remaining 50% of the 2018 performance unit awards. For the 50% portion of the 2018 performance units based on aggregate consolidated order intake, up to 150% of a participant's target award may be earned, and for the 50% portion of the 2018 performance units based on relative total shareholder return, up to 200% of a participant's target award may be earned, to further the alignment of management's interests with those of our stockholders. If earned, 2018 performance units are structured to be paid out in shares of McDermott common stock, cash equal to the fair market value of the shares otherwise deliverable, or any combination thereof, at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.
The earned award with respect to the aggregate consolidated order intake metric over the performance period from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 will be determined as follows:
The earned award with respect to the relative total shareholder return metric over the performance period from May 10, 2018 through December 31, 2020 will be determined as follows:
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units, or RSUs, are intended to promote the retention of employees, including the NEOs. The RSUs granted in 2018 generally vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. The RSUs may be paid out in shares of McDermott common stock, cash equal to the fair market value of the shares otherwise deliverable, or any combination thereof, at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
To identify median compensation for each element of total direct compensation, the Compensation Committee relies on "benchmarking." This involves reviewing the compensation of our NEOs relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives at companies we consider our peers. As a result, the annual base salary, target annual incentive compensation, target LTI and target total direct compensation (which may not be additive from the three individual elements of target TDC) for each of the NEOs is benchmarked. However, the specific performance metrics and performance levels used within elements of annual and long-term compensation are designed for the principal purpose of supporting our strategic and financial goals and driving the creation of stockholder value, and, as a result, generally are not benchmarked.
Compensation Peer Group
It is the Compensation Committee's practice to periodically review and consider the individual companies used for benchmarking purposes. As part of this practice, and in consideration of the significantly increased size and scope of McDermott following the Combination, the Compensation Committee selected a new set of peers for executive compensation benchmarking purposes. In selecting the companies included in the revised peer group, the Compensation Committee identified a number of desired traits, including companies in related industries, with executive roles of comparable size and scope, roles requiring comparable expertise and indicative of who McDermott may compete with for talent. The Compensation Committee believes that identification of peers using a broad industry sector code is inadequate and does not establish similarity of operations and business models, nor identify historical competitors for managerial talent – factors the Compensation Committee considers in the selection of companies for benchmarking purposes. Therefore, the Compensation Committee considers revenues as the primary indicator of company size and scope, but also routinely looks at other financial and capital value metrics. In this CD&A, we refer to this peer group, which is utilized to develop benchmarks for the amount of compensation opportunities awards to the executive officers, as the "Compensation Peer Group." For Messrs. Dickson, Spence, Freeman and Mukherjee, market data from the Compensation Peer Group was reflective of compensation as reported in the 2018 proxy statements (and subsequent public disclosures, where applicable) of the companies in the Compensation Peer Group. Market data from the Compensation Peer Group was not utilized in making compensation decisions for Mr. Prescott, due to the limited proxy statement disclosures and corresponding compensation information available relating to his position. The component companies of the Compensation Peer Group are as follows:
The only companies from this Compensation Peer Group which were also included in the peer group utilized for executive compensation benchmarking purposes in 2017, which we referred to as the Proxy Peer Group, are Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. and KBR, Inc.
Survey Peer Group
The Compensation Committee also utilized market data based on a set of companies in similar industries which participated in the Willis Towers Watson 2017 general industry survey, which we refer to as the "Survey Peer Group". Aside from screening companies on the basis of their industry classifications and revenues, no further refinements or judgements were applied in the identification of companies within the sample. The Survey Peer Group is intended to provide a reference point for pay levels within similar industries, and was used as a secondary reference for Messrs. Dickson, Spence, Freeman and Mukherjee, and a primary reference for Mr. Prescott.

Performance Peer Group
Similar to the Compensation Committee's review of the Compensation Peer Group, in consideration of the significantly increased size and scope of McDermott following the Combination, the Compensation Committee selected a new set of peers for use in connection with our 2018 Performance Unit awards. This set of peers, referred to as the Performance Peer Group, is referenced to develop relative industry benchmarks of company performance, with consideration of market conditions. In selecting the revised Performance Peer Group companies, the Compensation Committee identified a number of desired traits, including companies in similar or related industries, that are similarly influenced by the same macro-economic factors and are indicative of who McDermott may compete with for capital. The component companies of the Performance Peer Group are as follows:
In evaluating and awarding 2018 NEO compensation post-Combination, the Compensation Committee reviewed market data provided by Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"), our independent compensation consultant, which reflected benchmarks that indicated a higher range of compensation opportunities commensurate with a larger, more complex company. The NEO compensation approved by the Compensation Committee sought to align executives with their respective market median benchmark compensation opportunities, while establishing appropriate internal pay equity post-Combination. Accordingly, each NEO received increases to the elements of TDC in 2018. Even with those increases, however, each NEO's target TDC remains at or below to the market median compensation for his position, with the exception of Mr. Prescott, whose target TDC was established in excess of market median for the Survey Peer Group due to internal pay equity considerations.
CEO Compensation
Annual Base Salary – Following the Combination, Mr. Dickson received an increase in his annual base salary of 25%. This increase was provided to more closely align his annual base salary with the revised Compensation Peer Group market range, and resulted in his annual base salary being within 3% of market median.
Annual Incentive – As part of the Compensation Committee's bifurcated approach to the EICP in 2018, the following performance goals were approved for Mr. Dickson with respect to the pre-Combination period:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 mcdermott.com             53 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
The following performance goals were approved for Mr. Dickson with respect to the post-Combination period:
The Governance Committee's assessment of these individual performance goals considered McDermott's strategic and operational successes in 2018. Notably, under Mr. Dickson's leadership, McDermott completed the Combination with CB&I, which represented the culmination of a multi-year process through which McDermott's Board of Directors and executive management team considered both organic and inorganic strategies to increase the size and scale of the organization. The result of the Combination is the creation of a transformed company – a premier, fully integrated, global EPCI provider, with product solutions spanning onshore and offshore from concept to commissioning – with significantly increased earnings potential. As a testament to the benefits of the Combination, McDermott has booked new project awards that we believe neither legacy company would have won independently, and targeted over $475 million in annual run rate target savings under CPI, with $444 million of annualized cost synergies actioned through December 31, 2018. While substantial charges were incurred with respect to certain legacy CB&I projects, Mr. Dickson took significant remedial measures to address performance issues on those projects, including the installation of new executive leadership team members, improvements in reporting structures, executive plans and forecast cost-base methodology and the flow of communication across the joint venture members and customers. McDermott also ended 2018 with a strong liquidity position, with $1.4 billion of total cash availability as of December 31, 2018. To further drive value for customers and stockholders, Mr. Dickson led the adjustment of McDermott's operating model to account for our new, broader portfolio and footprint and guided the implementation of the One McDermott Way across the current project portfolio and prospective project bids. Following the Combination, McDermott completed a full strategic portfolio review, following which it was determined that the storage tank and pipe fabrication businesses should be divested, as not core to McDermott's long-term strategic objectives as a vertically integrated supplier with strong pull-through from our Technology segment. The sales processes are underway, with expected completion during 2019. Additionally, Mr. Dickson drove the integration of McDermott's QHSES processes and standards into the combined business, with the realignment of our Taking the Lead initiative to encompass the post-Combination organization, and directed focus of the cost of non-quality for the legacy CB&I business. During 2018, Mr. Dickson also significantly improved existing relationships with customers, co-venturers, the investment community, governments, banks and other stakeholders. Finally, through the completion of the Combination, Mr. Dickson established an experienced and proven leadership team, drawing on the strengths of both legacy organizations, and rolled-out a complete rebranding to modernize the face of post-Combination McDermott.
Following the Combination, Mr. Dickson received an increase in his target EICP award from 110% to 125% of his annual base salary earned, which resulted in his target EICP award equaling the revised Compensation Peer Group market median. In consideration of the Governance Committee's assessment of Mr. Dickson's achievement of his individual performance goals as discussed above, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Dickson a final EICP award of $1,250,000.
Long-Term Incentive – Following the Combination, Mr. Dickson received an increase in his 2018 target long-term incentive award, after which his target LTI award was within 3% of the revised Compensation Peer Group market median.

Annual Base Salary – Following the Combination, Messrs. Spence, Freeman and Prescott received increases in their respective annual base salaries to more closely align their respective annual base salary with the revised Compensation Peer Group market range, except in the case of Mr. Prescott, where the increase was based on internal pay equity considerations. Mr. Mukherjee's annual base salary was set in consideration of the revised Compensation Peer Group market median annual base salary for his position.
Annual Incentive – Following the Combination, Messrs. Spence and Freeman received increases in their respective target EICP awards to more closely align with the revised Compensation Peer Group market median. Mr. Mukherjee's target EICP award was set at the revised Compensation Peer Group market median.

Based on the Compensation Committee's and Mr. Dickson's assessment of each other NEO's achievement of his individual performance goals, the Compensation Committee awarded the other NEOs final EICP awards as follows:
Long-Term Incentive – Following the Combination, Messrs. Spence and Freeman received increases in their respective 2018 target long-term incentive awards to more closely align their target LTI award with the revised Compensation Peer Group market range. Mr. Mukherjee's target LTI award was set in consideration of the revised Compensation Peer Group market median target LTI award, as well as his relative experience in his position. Mr. Prescott received an increase in his target LTI award primarily based on internal pay equity considerations.

Recognition Program
In March 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the McDermott Recognition Program for its then-serving executive officers, including each of the NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Mukherjee (whose employment with McDermott began on July 3, 2018), to recognize the efforts associated with the Combination (through the date of approval of the program) and to retain the executive officers for a period following the Combination. The Compensation Committee approved award amounts under the McDermott Recognition Program as set forth below:
Under the program, 50% of the award amount was payable in cash within 15 days following the date of the closing of the Combination. The remaining 50% of the award is payable in cash, if at all, within 15 days following the first anniversary of the closing of the Combination, provided that at least $62.5 million in CPI savings have been achieved for any fiscal quarter ending after the closing date through the first anniversary of the Combination, based on an annualized $250 million in total CPI savings. If this CPI savings target has not been met as of the one-year anniversary of the Combination, then no payment will be made and any unpaid portion of the award will be forfeited.
Sign-On Awards
In connection with Mr. Mukherjee's appointment as Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer in July 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a $700,000 sign-on award of RSUs, which was intended to compensate him for the forfeiture of certain incentives from his former employer, as well as a cash signing bonus of $450,000, payable in a single lump-sum on his date of hire, which was intended to compensate him for other benefits from his former employer that he was foregoing by joining McDermott.
In connection with Mr. Prescott's appointment as Vice President, Asia, in January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a $400,000 sign-on award of RSUs, which was intended to compensate him for the forfeiture of certain incentives from his former employer.
Perquisites
In 2018 our Compensation Committee continued its approach with respect to perquisites started in 2016, and provided for financial planning services and an executive physical to be reimbursed to the participant or paid directly to the participant's provider of choice, in a combined amount not to exceed $20,000, rather than providing an allowance to be used for a company-required physical and any other purpose determined by the participant, as in prior years. No other perquisites were available to the participants in McDermott's perquisite program, with the exception of any company-required spousal travel for (1) the Chief Executive Officer, and (2) the remaining participants, including our NEOs, as approved by the Chief Executive Officer. There were no reimbursements to any perquisite program participants for company-required spousal travel in 2018.
Additionally, and consistent with our past practice, we may provide a gross-up for any imputed income related to such company-required spousal travel, but only when the presence of the spouse is related to the underlying business purpose of the trip. We also may provide our NEOs with a tax gross-up on any relocation-related expense reimbursements that may be subject to tax, but no such reimbursements were made in 2018.

Expatriate Benefits & Tax Equalization Program
McDermott provides benefits to our expatriate employees, which benefits are designed to relocate and support employees who are sent on an assignment outside of their home country. Expatriate benefits generally include an expatriate premium equal to 5-10% of the employee's base salary, a location premium in certain countries, a housing allowance (or company provided housing in certain locations), transportation allowance (or company provided transportation in certain locations), a cost of living differential, where applicable, a vacation allowance based on the cost of an economy plane ticket to the employee's home location, company paid education for approved dependents in locations where public education is not an option and a tax equalization program. Mr. Prescott received expatriate benefits during 2018, as Mr. Prescott is a dual British and Australian citizen based in Kuala Lumpur.
Under McDermott's tax equalization program, we ensure that participating expatriate employees are subject to essentially the same income tax liability on employment compensation as they would have paid had they lived and worked in the United States. Each expatriate employee is responsible for a hypothetical U.S. income tax liability based on an estimate of the expatriate's anticipated U.S. income tax liability on his or her stay-at-home employment income. Under the program, McDermott is responsible for the host country tax (if applicable) and assignment country taxes (if applicable) and any additional income taxes attributed to the international assignment in excess of the hypothetical tax liability. Mr. Mukherjee, while not an expatriate employee, is included in the tax equalization program to ensure that McDermott and Mr. Mukherjee remain tax compliant in all countries in which he may have a deemed tax liability.
Defined Contribution Plans
We provide retirement benefits for most of our U.S. based employees, including our U.S. based NEOs, through sponsorship of the McDermott Savings Plan, a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan that we refer to as the "Savings Plan." The Savings Plan was previously named the McDermott Thrift Plan, but was renamed effective January 1, 2019 following the merger of the CB&I Savings Plan into the McDermott Thrift Plan. We provide retirement benefits for our non-U.S. expatriate employees through sponsorship of a global defined contribution plan, which we refer to as the "McDermott Global Savings Plan."
Retirement Plans
As a local employee of CB&I Nederland B.V., a subsidiary of McDermott in The Netherlands, Mr. Mukherjee is a participant in the CB&I Nederland B.V. Retirement Plan (the "Dutch Retirement Plan"). The Dutch Retirement Plan is part of the standard terms and conditions for employees of CB&I Nederland B.V., and is administered in compliance with governing pension legislation in The Netherlands. The Dutch Retirement Plan is a collective defined contribution plan, but is reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as an average pay defined benefit plan. Other than through the Dutch Retirement Plan, we do not provide defined benefit pension plans to any of our NEOs. See the "Pension Benefits" table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below for more information.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The McDermott International, Inc. Director and Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, or the DCP, is a defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan established by our Board and the Compensation Committee to help maintain the competitiveness of our post-employment compensation as compared to our market. The DCP is an unfunded, nonqualified plan that provides each participant in the plan with benefits based on the participant's notional account balance at the time of retirement or termination. Under the DCP, on an annual basis, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to credit a specified participant's notional account with an amount equal to a percentage of the participant's prior-year base salary and annual bonus paid in the prior year. We refer to such credit as a "Company Contribution." In 2018, Messrs. Dickson, Spence and Freeman were participants in the DCP and their respective accounts in the DCP received a Company Contribution in an amount equal to 5% of the sum of their respective base salaries paid in 2017 (in all cases) and 2016 bonus paid in 2017 (in the case of Messrs. Dickson and Spence). Additionally, Mr. Freeman received a discretionary Company Contribution under the DCP equal in value to 5% of his 2017 target base salary he would have earned for the period from January 1, 2017 through his date of hire. Messrs. Mukherjee and Prescott were not participants in the DCP in 2018.

Table of Contents
The Compensation Committee has designated deemed mutual fund investments to serve as indices for the purpose of determining notional investment gains and losses to each participant's account for any Company Contribution or participant-elected deferrals. Each participant allocates any Company Contributions and deferrals among the various deemed investments. DCP benefits are based on the participant's vested notional account balance at the time of retirement or termination. Please see the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table and accompanying narrative below for more information about the DCP and Company Contributions to DCP accounts.
Employment Agreements
We do not currently have any employment agreements with any of our NEOs relating to ongoing employment, with the exception of Mr. Mukherjee. Mr. Mukherjee has an employment agreement with CB&I Nederland B.V., one of McDermott's subsidiaries in The Netherlands, related to his status as an employee of that entity, which sets forth the standard employment terms and conditions for employees in The Netherlands. The terms of the employment agreement are generally consistent with those of employment agreements entered into with McDermott's other employees (other than temporary employees) working in The Netherlands, with the exception of certain provisions relating to the Dutch net pension scheme, which provisions are not applicable to Mr. Mukherjee due to his receipt of a monthly contribution of $2,000 into the Dutch Retirement Plan.
Change in Control Agreements
We believe change in control agreements for executive officers are common within our industry, and our Board and the Compensation Committee believe that providing these agreements to our NEOs protects stockholders' interests by helping to assure management continuity and focus through and beyond a change in control. Accordingly, we have provided change in control agreements to key senior executives since 2005. Our change in control agreements contain what is commonly referred to as a "double trigger," that is, they provide benefits only upon an involuntary termination or constructive termination of the executive officer within one year following a change in control. The change in control agreements for our NEOs generally provide a cash severance payment of a multiple of the sum of the NEO's annual base salary and target EICP, as set forth below, and a pro-rated bonus payment under the EICP.
In addition, upon an involuntary termination or constructive termination within one year following a change in control, each such officer would become fully vested in any outstanding and unvested equity-based awards and his or her respective account balance in the DCP.
The change in control agreements: (1) do not provide for excise tax gross-ups; (2) require the applicable officer's execution of a release prior to payment of certain benefits; and (3) provide for the potential reduction in payments to an applicable officer in order to avoid excise taxes. The existing change in control agreements with Messrs. Freeman, Mukherjee and Prescott expired on March 15, 2019, prior to which the Compensation Committee approved a new form of Change in Control Agreement for these individuals, and other executive officers who currently have change in control agreements, other than Messrs. Dickson and Spence. The new form of change in control agreement is consistent in all material respects with the form of change in control agreement being replaced, except that (1) the term of the new change in control agreement will extend for an additional three years, through March 15, 2022, (2) the form of change in control agreement for Messrs. Mukherjee and Prescott contains a non-competition provision, and (3) the form of change in control agreement for Mr. Prescott provides a 2.0x multiple of base salary and target EICP for the cash severance payment referenced above. See the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" table under "Compensation of Executive Officers" below and the accompanying disclosures for more information regarding the change in control agreements with our NEOs, as well as other plans and arrangements that have different trigger mechanisms that relate to a change in control.

OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES
The Compensation Committee generally determines the size of equity-based grants as a dollar value, rather than granting a targeted number of shares or units, with each target value generally set within market range. To determine the number of restricted stock units and performance shares or units granted, the target value of long-term incentive compensation is divided by the fair market value of the applicable component of equity on the date of grant.
To avoid timing equity grants ahead of the release of material nonpublic information, the Compensation Committee generally grants equity awards effective as of the first day of the open trading window following the meeting at which the grants are approved, which window period generally opens on the third NYSE trading day following the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC.
To assist with the alignment of the interests of directors, executive officers and stockholders, we believe our directors and officers should have a significant financial stake in McDermott. To further that goal, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines requiring generally that our nonemployee directors and employees who are members of McDermott's EXCOM maintain a minimum ownership interest in McDermott. The EXCOM includes all of the NEOs. The ownership requirements are as follows:
Directors and officers have five years from their initial election as a director/officer or a change in position which increases the expected ownership level, whichever is later, to comply with the guidelines. Shares of McDermott common stock, restricted stock units (whether or not McDermott can settle them in cash and whether or not vested), performance shares and units (whether or not McDermott can settle them in cash and whether or not vested, but to the extent not vested, at target performance level), shares of McDermott common stock held in an employee's Savings Plan account and shares of McDermott common stock held in any trust in which an employee has a pecuniary interest (to the extent the employee has investment control over such shares) are all counted towards compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. Further, each director and officer subject to the stock ownership guidelines has the ability to certify his or her ownership at any time after reaching compliance with the required ownership level, following which such director or officer is not required to accumulate any additional McDermott securities, so long as he or she retains the number of securities held on the certification date, regardless of any subsequent changes in the market price of shares of McDermott common stock. All directors and NEOs currently meet or exceed their ownership requirement or are within the five-year period to achieve compliance.
McDermott's Insider Trading Policy prohibits all directors, officers and employees, including our NEOs, from engaging in "short sales" or trading in puts, calls or other options on McDermott's common stock. Additionally, directors, officers and employees are prohibited from, either directly or indirectly, through a designee or otherwise, purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) or otherwise engaging in any transactions that are designed to or have the effect of hedging or offsetting any decrease in the market value of any McDermott shares, and are further prohibited from holding McDermott shares in a margin account or pledging McDermott shares as collateral for a loan.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Our Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy, which provides that, if the consolidated financial statements of McDermott are materially restated within three years of their initial filing, and the Compensation Committee determines, in its reasonable discretion, that any current or former executive officer has engaged in intentional misconduct, and such misconduct caused or partially caused the need for such restatement, the Compensation Committee may, within 12 months after such a material restatement, require that the executive forfeit and/or return to McDermott all or a portion of the compensation vested, awarded or received under any bonus award, equity award or other award during the period subject to restatement and the 12-month period following the initial filing of the financial statements that were restated. The forfeiture and/or return of compensation under the policy would be limited to any portion that the executive officer would not have received if the consolidated financial statements had been reported properly at the time of their initial filing. The clawback policy would not apply to restatements occurring as a result of a change in control, as defined in the DCP, and the policy does not limit the ability of McDermott to pursue forfeiture or reclamation of amounts under applicable law.
Additionally, consistent with our recent practice, our grant agreements for awards made in 2018 contain a forfeiture provision. In 2018, this provision provided that, if any grantee who is employed by McDermott or performing services on behalf of McDermott under any consulting agreement is convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude, or engaging in conduct that adversely affects or, in the sole judgment of the Compensation Committee, may reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the business reputation or economic interests of McDermott, then all rights and benefits awarded under the respective agreements are immediately forfeited, terminated and withdrawn.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee has primary responsibility for determining and approving, on an annual basis, the compensation of our CEO and other executive officers. The Compensation Committee evaluates, in coordination with the Governance Committee, the CEO's performance in light of goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation, and sets the CEO's compensation based on that evaluation. The Compensation Committee receives information and advice from its compensation consultant as well as from our human resources department and management to assist in compensation determinations.
Compensation Consultant
After completion of a selection process, in August 2017 our Compensation Committee engaged Meridian to serve as its consultant on executive compensation matters. Meridian provided advice and analysis to the Compensation Committee on the design, structure and level of executive and director compensation, and, when requested by the Compensation Committee, attended meetings of the Compensation Committee and participated in executive sessions without members of management present. Meridian reported directly to the Compensation Committee. When requested by the Governance Committee, Meridian will attend meetings of the Governance Committee with respect to nonemployee director compensation. While the Compensation Committee generally reviews its compensation consultant on an annual basis, in consideration of the recently completed Combination, the Compensation Committee deferred its annual review of Meridian for 2018 until 2019, to allow the newly constituted Compensation Committee sufficient time to review and consider Meridian's performance.
During 2018, Meridian did not perform any services for McDermott other than as described above. In January 2019, our Compensation Committee assessed whether the work performed by Meridian during 2018 raised any conflict of interest and determined that Meridian's work performed for the Compensation Committee raised no conflict of interest.
Role of CEO and Management
While the Compensation Committee has the responsibility to approve and monitor all compensation for our executive officers, management plays an important role in determining executive compensation. Management, at the request of the Compensation Committee, recommends financial goals that drive the business and works with Meridian to analyze competitive market data and to recommend compensation levels for our executive officers other than our CEO. Our CEO likewise assists the Compensation Committee by providing his evaluation of the performance of our other executive officers and recommending compensation for those officers, including adjustments to their annual incentive compensation, based on individual performance.

PENSION BENEFITS
The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to Mr. Mukherjee under the Dutch Retirement Plan. We do not provide pension plans to any of our other NEOs.
As a local employee of CB&I Nederland B.V., a subsidiary of McDermott in The Netherlands, Mr. Mukherjee is a participant in the Dutch Retirement Plan, a local retirement plan which is part of the standard terms and conditions for employees of CB&I Nederland B.V.
The basic pension scheme under the Dutch Retirement Plan is a collective defined contribution scheme that is administered in compliance with governing pension legislation in The Netherlands. The collective defined contribution consists of contributions by both the employer and the participant. The employer's fixed contribution to the basic pension scheme is 15% of the pensionable salary (which is statutorily capped, and was EUR 105,075 in 2018). The participant's contribution to the basic pension scheme is 7% of the pension-based salary, which is the portion of a participant's salary over which the participant's contribution is calculated. The pension-based salary is determined by subtracting a franchise amount from the pensionable salary. Under the terms of the Dutch Retirement Plan, the franchise amount, which is adjusted annually and deducted to establish the pension-based salary, was EUR 21,483 in 2018.
CB&I Nederland B.V. also offers a voluntary net pension scheme in order to provide participants with a gross annual salary exceeding the maximum pension-based salary the opportunity to increase their pension over the portion of their salary that is in excess of this amount. Although his gross annual salary exceeded the maximum pension-based salary, Mr. Mukherjee was not a participant in the net pension scheme, as he receives a gross additional pension allowance from McDermott of $2,000 per month in lieu of participating in either the net pension scheme or the Savings Plan.

Under the Dutch Retirement Plan, standard retirement is age 67. The default benefits include a lifetime old-age pension annuity, a 70% survivors' pension annuity, a temporary survivor's pension of 5% of the uncapped pensionable salary, payable in case the participant's death prior to the standard retirement date until the beneficiary survivor reaches the state pension retirement age, an orphan's pension and an excess disability pension.
Mr. Mukherjee's participation in the Dutch Retirement Plan commenced upon his date of hire, July 3, 2018. Mr. Mukherjee's yearly accrued old-age pension annuity under the Dutch Retirement Plan is calculated as follows: 1.75% of the annual maximum pensionable salary minus the franchise amount for each year of service up to the default retirement age.
For more information on our retirement plans, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — 2018 Other Compensation Elements — Retirement and Excess Plans."
NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The following Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table summarizes our NEOs' compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The compensation shown in this table is entirely attributable to the Deferred Compensation Plan.
The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, defined contribution retirement plan for officers of McDermott and its subsidiaries selected to participate by our Compensation Committee. Benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan are based on: (1) the participant's deferral account, which is comprised of the notional account balance reflecting any executive contributions of deferred compensation; and (2) the participant's vested percentage in his or her company account, which is comprised of the notional account balance reflecting any contributions by us. A participant is at all times 100% vested in his or her deferral account. A participant generally vests in his or her company account 20% each year, subject to accelerated vesting for death, disability, termination of service by McDermott without cause or the occurrence of a change in control. Messrs. Mukherjee and Prescott were not participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2018.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following tables show potential payments to our NEOs under existing contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements, whether written or unwritten, for various scenarios under which a payment would be due (assuming each is applicable) involving a change in control or termination of employment of each of our NEOs, assuming a December 31, 2018 termination date and, where applicable, using the closing price of our common stock of $6.54 as of December 31, 2018 (as reported on the NYSE). These tables do not reflect amounts that would be payable to the NEOs pursuant to benefits or awards that are already vested.
The amounts reported in the tables below for restricted stock units and performance units represent the value of unvested and accelerated shares or units, as applicable, calculated by multiplying the number of accelerated shares or units by $6.54 (the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018, as reported on the NYSE).
The following table shows the value of payments and other benefits due the NEOs, assuming their death or disability as of December 31, 2018.

We have change in control agreements with various officers, including each of our NEOs. Generally, under these agreements, if a NEO is terminated within one year following a change in control either (1) by our company for any reason other than cause or death or disability or (2) by the NEO for good reason, McDermott would be required to pay the NEO a severance payment based on the NEO's salary and a severance payment based on the NEO's target EICP percentage. In addition to these payments, the NEO would be entitled to various accrued benefits earned through the date of termination, such as earned but unpaid salary, earned but unused vacation and reimbursements.
Under these agreements, a "change in control" generally occurs on the occurrence of any of the following:
The change in control agreements do not provide for excise tax gross-ups. They do, however, provide for the potential reduction in payments to the applicable officer in order to avoid excise taxes.
The completion of the Combination on May 10, 2018 constituted a "change in control" for purposes of the change in control agreements described above, except for Mr. Mukherjee (whose employment with McDermott commenced on July 3, 2018). However, no payment to an NEO will be triggered under any change in control agreement with an NEO unless that NEO's employment with us is terminated under any of the circumstances described above within one year of the completion of that transaction.

PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
The table below sets forth comparative information regarding: (1) the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Dickson, for the year ended December 31, 2018, determined on the basis described below; (2) the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of McDermott and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, for the year ended December 31, 2018, determined on the basis described below; and (3) a ratio comparison of those two amounts. These amounts were determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the SEC.
The applicable SEC rules require us to identify the median employee, by using either annual total compensation for all such employees or another consistently applied compensation measure. For these purposes, we used total earnings, as determined from McDermott's payroll records for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (with December 31, 2018 being the "Measurement Date"), as our consistently applied compensation measure. We included all employees of McDermott and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the Measurement Date, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis and whether employed in the U.S. or a non-U.S. jurisdiction. We did not use statistical sampling or include cost of living adjustments for purposes of this determination. We converted all amounts paid in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars, using the exchange rate in effect as of the close of market on December 31, 2018.
After identifying the median employee, based on the process described above, we calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology we used for determining total compensation for 2018 for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. The median employee is an Indian national employed as a Structural Fitter at our fabrication yard in Dubai, paid on an hourly basis in United Arab Emirates Dirham. The median employee's hourly pay was determined based on a review of market data for companies with individuals in similar positions and location, and such pay is within market range compensation. The median employee's total compensation is inclusive of holiday pay, vacation pay, religious holiday pay and McDermott provided housing accommodations.
The Compensation Committee reviewed the ratio set forth in the table above and determined that the differential in compensation reflected above is appropriate for the Company, given the wide range of responsibilities and level of accountability of our Chief Executive Officer, as compared to our median employee.
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

Auditor and Audit Committee Matters
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of audit and non-audit fees) and evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. Our Board of Directors has ratified the decision of the Audit Committee to appoint Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. Although we are not required to seek stockholder approval of this appointment, it has been our practice to do so. No determination has been made as to what action the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors would take if our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee retains discretion to appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the Audit Committee concludes such a change would be in the best interests of McDermott. Representatives of EY will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to respond to appropriate questions.  
 AUDIT COMMITTEE EVALUATION 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee annually evaluates the performance of McDermott's independent registered public accounting firm, and determines whether to reappoint the current accounting firm or consider other firms. EY was appointed in 2018 following a competitive request for proposal process, replacing Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T") as our principal outside auditor. In selecting EY over competing firms, including D&T, the Audit Committee considered, among other things, each firm's: 
Based on its evaluation, the Audit Committee believed the appointment of EY for fiscal year 2018 was in the best interests of McDermott and our stockholders.
At its meeting held in February 2019, the Audit Committee approved the reappointment of EY as McDermott's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. In determining whether to reappoint EY for fiscal year 2019, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including the quality of EY's audit and non-audit work, based on its oversight of the firm's work product, EY's reports on its quality controls and its performance during 2018, external data on EY's audit

quality and performance, the appropriateness of EY's fees, and EY's written disclosures and independence letter required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. The Audit Committee determined the continued engagement of EY is in the best interests of McDermott and our stockholders. The Board of Directors concurred, and ratified the Audit Committee's appointment of EY to serve as our independent public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

 RECOMMENDATION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the decision of our Audit Committee to appoint Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. The proxy holders will vote all proxies received for approval of this proposal unless instructed otherwise. Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote and actually voting on this proposal at the Annual Meeting. Because abstentions are not actual votes with respect to this proposal, they have no effect on the outcome of the vote on this proposal.

 AUDITOR AND AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS 
● We received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding EY's communications with the Audit Committee  concerning EY's independence from McDermott, and have discussed with EY its independence from McDermott.

2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan
[BEGIN TABLE]
 We are asking our stockholders to approve the adoption of the 2019 McDermott International, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2019 LTIP"). On February 27, 2019, our Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, a new long-term incentive plan, the 2019 LTIP, to replace the 2016 LTIP. We intend to reserve for issuance  pursuant to awards under the 2019 LTIP 2,475,000 shares plus the number of shares that remain available for issuance under the 2016 LTIP and the Chicago Bridge & Iron 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "CB&I LTIP"). Unused shares  under the expired Shaw Group, Inc. 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Shaw Plan"), although no longer available for grant, served as a consideration in determining the optimal number of shares to reserve for issuance pursuant to awards under  the 2019 LTIP. In addition, if our stockholders approve the 2019 LTIP, shares that would otherwise become available for issuance under 2016 LTIP, the 2014 LTIP, the 2009 McDermott International, Inc. Long-Term  Incentive Plan, the CB&I LTIP and the Shaw Plan (collectively referred to as the "prior plans") as a result of forfeitures, expiration or cancellation of previously made awards will become available for issuance under the 2019 LTIP, and  no additional grants will be made pursuant to the prior plans. A summary of the 2019 LTIP is set forth below. This summary is, however, qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2019 LTIP, which is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy  Statement.

[END TABLE]
The 2019 LTIP is intended to replace the 2016 LTIP and the CB&I LTIP and is needed to continue our equity compensation program. As of March 11, 2019, there were 630,788 shares of common stock remaining available for grant under the 2016 LTIP and 2,057,669 shares available for grant under the CB&I LTIP. Shares subject to awards that expire or are terminated, forfeited, or cancelled under the prior plans will become available for issuance under the 2019 LTIP, assuming the 2019 LTIP is approved, and the shares subject to the awards will be added back to the pool of available shares on the same basis as such shares counted against the overall share limit when granted under the applicable prior plan. Any previously granted awards that are outstanding under prior plans will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. As of March 11, 2019, there were 5,405,451 full-value awards (restricted stock units and performance units) outstanding, and 328,523 shares underlying stock options and stock appreciation rights outstanding, with such stock options and stock appreciation rights having a weighted average remaining term of 1.04 years and weighted average exercise price of $31.38.
If the 2019 LTIP is not approved by the stockholders, we will not be able to continue our equity-based long-term incentive program, and we may be required to increase significantly the cash component of our executive compensation program in order to remain competitive and adequately compensate our employees. The lack of an equity compensation program would eliminate a key tool in our ability to ensure alignment between executive and stockholder interests.
We believe that incentive awards are critical to attracting, retaining and engaging highly qualified employees and to aligning their financial interests with the financial interests of our stockholders. Our Board recommends that stockholders approve the 2019 LTIP to allow us to continue to provide such incentives.
Stockholder approval of the 2019 LTIP will also constitute approval for purposes of satisfying the stockholder approval requirements under Section 422 of the Code so that the Compensation Committee may grant incentive stock options, or ISOs.

 KEY CHANGES FROM THE 2016 LTIP 
[END TABLE]
We believe that the 2016 LTIP has been effective in attracting and retaining highly-qualified employees and non-employee directors and has provided incentives that align the economic interests of participants with those of our stockholders. The 2019 LTIP retains most of the material terms of the 2016 LTIP, with certain changes to better align our plan with current trends related to plan design and corporate governance, as illustrated by the table below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Number of shares reserved   12 million   2,475,000, plus unused shares reserved from prior plans 
 Annual Limits on Employee Grants   Maximum annual per person grant of 3,000,000 shares subject to options. Maximum annual per person grant of 3,000,000 shares in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Maximum annual cash payout of $12,000,000 per person for performance units.   No provision. As a result of the elimination of the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code, these per person limitations are no longer necessary. Annual limits  on director awards remain in place. 
 Annual Limits on Employee Grants   Maximum annual per person grant of 3,000,000 shares subject to options. Maximum annual per person grant of 3,000,000 shares in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Maximum annual cash payout of $12,000,000 per person for performance units.   No provision. As a result of the elimination of the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code, these per person limitations are no longer necessary. Annual limits  on director awards remain in place. 
 Minimum Vesting   Awards to employees subject to a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant, subject to an exception for up to 5% of the shares reserved.   All awards (including director awards) will have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant, subject to exceptions for up to 5% of the shares reserved as well as for director  grants that vest at the next annual meeting.

 2019 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
[END TABLE]
In determining the number of shares to make available under the 2019 LTIP, the Compensation Committee considered the key historical stock usage data under the 2016 LTIP described above, the advice of Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, its independent compensation consultant, and the expected dilution resulting from the 2019 LTIP. The Compensation Committee also considered many factors that affect the number of shares required for long-term incentive equity awards, such as changes in stock price over the life of the plan, the number of participants in the program and the size of awards to each participant. Considering all of these factors, the Compensation Committee determined that 2,475,000 shares, plus the number of shares remaining available for grant under the prior plans, is a prudent amount to satisfy the long-term incentive goals of the 2019 LTIP and also meet the expectations of the stockholders for minimal levels of dilution.
If the 2019 LTIP is approved, the total dilution from all outstanding awards under the prior plans as of March 11, 2019 and the shares requested for issuance under the 2019 LTIP would be approximately 4.5% of the common shares outstanding.
Administration. The 2019 LTIP will be administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee will select the participants and determine the type or types of awards and the number of shares or units to be optioned or granted to each participant under the 2019 LTIP. All or part of the award may be subject to conditions established by the Compensation Committee, which may include continued service with our company, achievement of specific business objectives, increases in specified indices, attainment of specified growth rates or other comparable measures of performance. The Compensation Committee will have full and final authority to implement the 2019 LTIP and may, from time to time, adopt rules and regulations in order to carry out the terms of the 2019 LTIP. As permitted by applicable law, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may delegate its duties under the 2019 LTIP to another committee of the Board of Directors or to our chief executive officer and other senior officers, but not with respect to the authority to make awards to directors. The Compensation Committee has previously delegated the authority to make grants pursuant to prior plans to non-officers to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer.
Eligibility. Members of the Board of Directors, executive officers and employees of our company and its subsidiaries, as well as consultants, are eligible to participate in the 2019 LTIP. The Compensation Committee will select the participants for the 2019 LTIP. Any participant may receive more than one award under the 2019 LTIP. Presently, 831 current and former employees and 10 current and former non-employee members of the Board of Directors participate in the prior plans, although all of our approximately 32,000 employees are eligible for grants under the 2019 Plan in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Because the 2019 LTIP provides for broad discretion in selecting participants and in making awards, however, the total number of persons who will participate going forward and the respective benefits to be awarded to them cannot be determined at this time.
Shares Available for Issuance through the 2019 LTIP. Shares available for issuance under the prior plans that have not been issued as of the date the 2019 LTIP is approved by stockholders will become available for issuance under the 2019 LTIP. As of March 11, 2019, 630,788 shares remained available for issuance under the 2016 LTIP and 2,057,669 shares remained available for issuance under the CB&I LTIP. 326,139 shares remained available for issuance pursuant to the Shaw Plan when it expired in January 2019 and such shares will not be added to the shares available for issuance under the 2019 LTIP. Through this proposal, we are asking stockholders for authorization to reserve 2,475,000 shares for issuance under the 2019 LTIP in addition to the shares remaining available for issuance under the 2016 LTIP and CB&I LTIP. No awards will be made under the 2019 LTIP until stockholders have approved the 2019 LTIP. The closing price per share of our common stock as of March 11, 2019 was $8.24.
The 2019 LTIP provides for a number of forms of stock-based compensation, as further described below. Awards settled in shares will count against the 2019 LTIP's overall share limit as one share for each share subject to such award. The 2019 LTIP also permits the reuse or reissuance by the 2019 LTIP of shares of common stock underlying canceled, expired, terminated or

forfeited awards of stock-based compensation granted under prior plans, and the shares subject to the awards will be added back to the pool of available shares on the same basis as such shares counted against the overall share limit when granted under the applicable prior plan. Shares tendered or withheld on the settlement or exercise of a stock option as payment for tax withholding or the exercise price will not become available again under the 2019 LTIP.
The Compensation Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the number and kind of shares that may be issued, the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards, the exercise or other applicable price and other value determinations applicable to outstanding awards under the 2019 LTIP to reflect any amendment to the 2019 LTIP, stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination or exchange of shares or other similar event.
Types of Awards Under the 2019 LTIP. The Compensation Committee may award to participants incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares and performance units. The forms of awards are described in greater detail below.
Stock Options. The Compensation Committee will have discretion to award incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. A stock option is a right to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at a specified grant price. An incentive stock option is intended to qualify as such under Section 422 of the Code. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. Subject to the specific terms of the 2019 LTIP, the Compensation Committee will have discretion to determine the number of shares, the exercise price, the terms and conditions of exercise, whether an option will qualify as an incentive stock option under the Code and set such additional limitations on and terms of option grants as it deems appropriate.
Options granted to participants under the 2019 LTIP will expire at such times as the Compensation Committee determines at the time of the grant, but no option will be exercisable later than seven years from the date of grant. Each option award agreement will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to exercise the option following termination of the participant's employment. The termination provisions will be determined within the discretion of the Compensation Committee, may not be uniform among all participants and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment. Dividend equivalents do not attach to stock options.
Upon the exercise of an option granted under the 2019 LTIP, the option price is payable in full to us (1) in cash; (2) if permitted in the award agreement, by tendering shares having a fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the total option price; (3) if permitted in the award agreement, by a combination of (1) and (2); or (4) by any other method approved by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion at the time of the grant and as set forth in the related award agreement.
Restricted Stock. The Compensation Committee also will be authorized to award restricted shares of common stock under the 2019 LTIP on such terms and conditions as it shall establish. Although recipients will have the right to vote restricted shares from the date of grant, they will not have the right to sell or otherwise transfer the shares during the applicable period of restriction or until earlier satisfaction of other conditions imposed by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. The award agreement will specify the periods of restriction, restrictions based on achievement of specific performance objectives, restrictions under applicable federal or state securities laws and such other terms it deems appropriate. Unless the Compensation Committee otherwise determines, participants will receive dividends on their shares of restricted stock; provided, however, that such dividends will be held by the company and will be subject to the same vesting period as the shares of restricted stock with respect to which the dividends are paid.
Each award agreement for restricted stock will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to retain unvested shares of restricted stock following termination of the participant's employment. These provisions will be determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, need not be uniform among all shares of restricted stock issued pursuant to the 2019 LTIP and may reflect distinctions based on reasons for termination of employment.
Restricted Stock Units. An award of a restricted stock unit constitutes an agreement by us to deliver shares of our common stock or to pay an amount equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock for each restricted stock unit to a participant in the future in consideration of the performance of services. Restricted stock units may be granted by the Compensation Committee on such terms and conditions as it may establish. The restricted stock unit award agreement will specify the vesting period or periods, the specific performance objectives and such other conditions as may apply to the award. During the applicable vesting period, participants will have no voting rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying a restricted stock unit grant. However, participants shall, unless the Compensation Committee otherwise determines, receive dividend equivalents on the shares underlying their restricted stock unit grant in the form of cash or additional restricted stock units if a dividend is paid with respect to shares of our common stock.

 2019 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
[END TABLE]
Each award agreement for restricted stock units will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to retain unvested restricted stock units following termination of employment. These provisions will be determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, need not be uniform among all participants and may reflect distinctions based on reasons for termination of employment.
Performance Shares and Performance Units. Performance units and performance shares are forms of performance awards that are subject to the attainment of one or more pre-established performance goals during a designated performance period. Performance units and performance shares may be granted by the Compensation Committee at any time in such amounts and on such terms as the Compensation Committee determines. Each performance unit will have an initial value that is established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. Each performance share will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. The Compensation Committee in its discretion will determine the applicable performance period and will establish performance goals for any given performance period. When the performance period expires, the holder of performance shares or performance units will be entitled to receive a payout on the units and/or shares earned over the performance period based on the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved. Participants holding performance shares and/or performance units are not entitled to receive dividend equivalents for dividends declared with respect to shares of our common stock.
Payments may be made in cash or in shares of common stock that have an aggregate fair market value equal to the earned performance units or performance shares on the last day of the applicable performance period. Each award agreement will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to receive a payout of these performance shares and/or performance units following termination of the participant's employment. The termination provisions will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, may not be uniform among all participants and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment.
Director Awards. Awards to non-employee directors may be in any of the forms of awards described above, other than incentive stock options. The aggregate grant date fair value of awards to any individual non-employee director may not exceed $500,000 in any calendar year.
Performance Measures. The Compensation Committee may grant awards under the 2019 LTIP to eligible employees subject to the attainment of performance measures established by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. The number of performance-based awards granted to an officer or employee in any year will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.
Deferrals. The Compensation Committee will have the discretion to provide for the deferral of an award or to permit participants to elect to defer payment of some or all types of awards in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Minimum Vesting. Other than in the event of an earlier death or disability, each award under the 2019 LTIP shall have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of its grant and no portion or installment of an award shall vest until one year from the date of grant; provided, however, that awards with respect to 5% of the shares authorized for grant pursuant to the 2019 LTIP may have a vesting period of less than one year; provided, however, that awards to directors who are not employees will not count against the shares available for this exception even if the vesting period is less than one year from the grant date, but not less than 50 weeks, so long as such awards are granted in connection with the regular annual meeting of stockholders and vest at the next regular annual meeting of stockholders following the grant date.
Change in Control. Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the 2019 LTIP), outstanding awards will be adjusted or substituted in accordance with the terms of the 2019 LTIP, and the default treatment unless otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee in the applicable award agreement, is as follows. If the participant does not receive a replacement award with respect to any outstanding award as of the change in control, then each such outstanding award will become fully vested and, if applicable, exercisable and any restrictions applicable to such award will lapse, with any applicable performance goals deemed to have been achieved at the greater of target level as of the date of such vesting or the actual performance level had the performance period ended on the date of the change in control. If a participant receives a replacement award and the participant terminates his or her employment for good reason, the participant is involuntarily terminated for reasons other than for cause, or the participant's employment terminates due to the participant's death or disability during the three-year period commencing on the date of a change in control, then (A) all replacement awards held by the participant will become fully vested and, if applicable, exercisable and free of restrictions (with any applicable performance goals deemed to have been achieved at the greater of target level or the actual performance level measured through the date

of the change in control), and (B) all stock options held by the participant immediately before such termination of employment that the participant also held as of the date of the change in control or that constitute replacement awards will remain exercisable for not less than three years following such termination of employment or until the expiration of the stated term of such stock option, whichever period is shorter (provided, however, that if the applicable award agreement provides for a longer period of exercisability, that provision will control).
Adjustment and Amendments. The 2019 LTIP provides for appropriate adjustments in the number of shares of our common stock subject to awards and available for future awards in the event of changes in our outstanding common stock by reason of a merger, stock split or certain other events. The 2019 LTIP may be modified, altered, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time and for any purpose that the Board of Directors deems appropriate, but no amendment to the 2019 LTIP may adversely affect any outstanding awards without the affected participant's consent, and stockholder approval will be required if an amendment would materially modify the 2019 LTIP or would be required by applicable law.
Transferability. Except as otherwise specified in a participant's award agreement, no award granted pursuant to, and no right to payment under, the 2019 LTIP will be assignable or transferable by a 2019 LTIP participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and any right granted under the 2019 LTIP will be exercisable during a participant's lifetime only by the participant or by the participant's court appointed representative.
Duration of the 2019 LTIP. The 2019 LTIP will remain in effect until all options and rights granted thereunder have been satisfied or terminated pursuant to the terms of the 2019 LTIP and all performance periods for performance-based awards granted thereunder have been completed. However, in no event will any award be granted under the 2019 LTIP on or after May 2, 2029.
The following summary is based on current interpretations of existing federal income tax laws. The discussion below is not purported to be complete, and it does not discuss the tax consequences arising in the context of the participant's death or the income tax laws of any local, state or foreign country in which the participant's income or gain may be taxable.
Stock Options. Some of the options issuable under the 2019 LTIP may constitute incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, while other options granted under the 2019 LTIP may be nonqualified stock options. The Code provides for tax treatment of stock options qualifying as incentive stock options that may be more favorable to employees than the tax treatment accorded nonqualified stock options.
Generally, upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option, the optionee will recognize no income for United States federal income tax purposes. The difference between the exercise price of the incentive stock option and the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise is, however, an item of tax preference that may require payment of an alternative minimum tax. If the participant disposes of shares acquired by exercise of an incentive stock option either before the expiration of two years from the date the options are granted or within one year after the issuance of shares upon exercise of the incentive stock option (the "holding periods"), the participant will recognize in the year of disposition: (1) ordinary income to the extent that the lesser of either (a) the fair market value of the shares on the date of option exercise or (b) the amount realized upon disposition exceeds the option price and (2) capital gain to the extent the amount realized upon disposition exceeds the fair market value of the shares on the date of option exercise. If the shares are sold after expiration of the holding periods, the participant generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon disposition and the option price.
An optionee will recognize no income on the grant of a nonqualified stock option. Upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the optionee will recognize ordinary taxable income (subject to withholding) in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. Upon any sale of such shares by the optionee, any difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise of the nonqualified option will be treated generally as capital gain or loss.

 2019 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
[END TABLE]
No deduction is available to us upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option (although a deduction may be available if the employee sells the shares so purchased before the applicable holding period expires), whereas upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option, we are entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the income recognized by the optionee. Except with respect to death or disability of an optionee, an optionee has three months after termination of employment in which to exercise an incentive stock option and retain favorable tax treatment at exercise. An option exercised more than three months after an optionee's termination of employment (other than upon death or disability) cannot qualify for the tax treatment accorded incentive stock options; such options would be treated as nonqualified stock options instead.
Restricted Stock. A participant generally recognizes no taxable income at the time of an award of restricted stock. A participant may, however, make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to have the grant taxed as compensation income at the date of receipt, with the result that any future appreciation or depreciation in the value of the shares of stock granted may be taxed as capital gain or loss on a subsequent sale of the shares. If the participant does not make a Section 83(b) election, the grant will be taxed as compensation income at the full fair market value on the date the restrictions imposed on the shares expire. Unless a participant makes a Section 83(b) election, any dividends paid to the participant on the shares of restricted stock will generally be compensation income to the participant and deductible by us as compensation expense. In general, we will receive an income tax deduction for any compensation income taxed to the participant. To the extent a participant realizes capital gains, as described above, we will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes.
Restricted Stock Units. A participant who is granted a restricted stock unit will recognize no income upon grant of the restricted stock unit. At the time the underlying shares of common stock (or cash in lieu thereof) are delivered to a participant, the participant will recognize compensation income equal to the full fair market value of the shares received. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction corresponding to the compensation income recognized by the participant.
Performance Share or Performance Unit Awards. A participant who is granted a performance share or a performance unit award will recognize no income upon grant of the performance share or a performance unit award. At the time the common stock is received as payment in respect of a performance share or performance unit award, the participant will recognize compensation income equal to the fair market value of the shares received. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction corresponding to the compensation income recognized by the participant.
Certain Tax Code Limitations on Deductibility. In general, a U.S. Federal income tax deduction is allowed to the company in an amount equal to the ordinary taxable income recognized by a participant with respect to awards granted under the 2019 LTIP, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense of the company, that such amount is reasonable and that the company satisfies any withholding obligations with respect to the participant's ordinary taxable income. Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, beginning with the 2018 calendar year, the $1 million annual deduction limitation under Section 162(m) applies to compensation paid to any individual who serves as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or qualifies as one of the other three most highly compensated executive officers in 2017 or any later calendar year.
Section 409A. Section 409A of the Code generally provides that any deferred compensation arrangement must satisfy specific requirements, both in operation and in form, regarding (1) the timing of payment, (2) the election of deferrals, and (3) restrictions on the acceleration of payment. Failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code may result in the early taxation (plus interest) to the participant of deferred compensation and the imposition of a 20% penalty on the participant on such deferred amounts included in the participant's income. We intend to structure awards under the 2019 LTIP in a manner that is designed to be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code.
Change in Control. The acceleration of the exercisability or the vesting of a grant or award upon the occurrence of a change in control may result in an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. A "parachute payment" occurs when an employee receives payments contingent upon a change in control that exceed an amount equal to three times his or her "base amount." The term "base amount" generally means the average annual compensation paid to such employee during the five-year period preceding the change in control. An "excess parachute payment" is the excess of all parachute payments made to the employee on account of a change in control over the employee's base amount. If any amount received by an employee is characterized as an excess parachute payment, the employee is subject to a 20% excise tax on the amount of the excess, and we are denied a deduction with respect to such excess payment.

 NEW PLAN BENEFITS 
[END TABLE]
The benefits that will be received under the 2019 LTIP by particular individuals or groups are not determinable at this time. Awards granted under the 2019 LTIP are within the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee has not determined future awards or who might receive them. No awards or grants have been made under the 2019 LTIP that are contingent on stockholder approval of the 2019 LTIP.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  As of March 11, 2019, there were approximately 328,523 securities to be issued upon exercise or vesting of outstanding options and stock appreciation rights. The weighted average price reflects only the weighted-average exercise price of stock options and stock appreciation rights outstanding. 
(2)  As of March 11, 2019, there were approximately 5,405,451 securities to be issued upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units or performance units (assuming performance units vest at the target level). A majority of the award agreements for the restricted stock units and all of the award agreements for the performance units granted under the 2016 Plan provide that the awards may be settled in shares, cash equal to the fair market value of the shares otherwise deliverable on the vesting date, or any combination thereof in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. A majority of the award agreements for the restricted stock units granted under the CB&I Plan provide that the awards may be settled only in shares. 1,134,927 restricted stock units granted under the 2016 Plan and the CB&I Plan provide that awards may be settled only in cash equal to the fair market value of the shares otherwise deliverable on the vesting date; these awards are not reflected as outstanding awards in this table and are not deducted from the shares remaining available for future awards. 
(3)  Includes shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights or the vesting of restricted stock units, or shares of our common stock remaining available for future issuance under the CB&I LTIP and the Shaw Plan (together, the "Assumed Plans"), which we assumed as a result of the Combination. Under the Assumed Plans, as of March 11, 2019, 63,556 shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights, at a weighted average exercise price of $32.37, 1,789,856 shares of our common stock were issuable upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and 2,057,669 shares of our common stock were available for future issuance. 
 RECOMMENDATION AND VOTE REQUIRED 
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" approval of this proposal. The proxy holders will vote all proxies received for approval of this proposal unless instructed otherwise. Our directors have an interest in and may benefit from the adoption of this proposal because they are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 LTIP. Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote and actually voting on this proposal at the Annual Meeting. In general, brokers do not have discretionary authority on proposals relating to equity compensation plans. Therefore, absent instructions from you, your broker may not vote your shares on this proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the vote.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS AND VOTING
What is the purpose of these proxy materials?   As more fully described in the Notice, the Board of Directors of McDermott has made these materials available to you in connection with our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will take place on May 2, 2019 at 8:00 a.m., local time (the "Annual Meeting" or "Meeting"). We mailed the Notice to our stockholders beginning on March 22, 2019, and our proxy materials were posted on the Web site referenced in the Notice on that same date.
McDermott, on behalf of its Board of Directors, is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We solicit proxies to give all stockholders of record an opportunity to vote on matters that will be presented at the Annual Meeting. In this proxy statement you will find information on these matters, which is provided to assist you in voting your shares.
Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?   We will bear all expenses incurred in connection with this proxy solicitation, which we expect to conduct primarily by mail. We have engaged Georgeson to assist in the solicitation for a fee that will not exceed $13,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, our officers and regular employees may solicit your proxy by telephone, by facsimile transmission or in person, for which they will not be separately compensated. If your shares are held through a broker or other nominee (i.e., in "street name") and you have requested printed versions of these materials, we have requested that your broker or nominee forward this proxy statement to you and obtain your voting instructions, for which we will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?   Our Board of Directors selected March 11, 2019 as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. This means that if you owned McDermott common stock on the Record Date, you may vote your shares on the matters to be considered by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting.
There were 181,590,930 shares of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter to be acted on at the meeting.
Who may attend the Annual Meeting?   Attendance at the meeting is limited to stockholders and beneficial owners as of the record date or duly appointed proxies. No guests will be admitted, except for guests invited by McDermott. Registration will begin at 7:30 a.m., and the meeting will begin promptly at 8:00 a.m. If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you are a beneficial owner, and beneficial owners will need to show proof of beneficial ownership, such as a copy of a brokerage account statement, reflecting stock ownership as of the Record Date in order to be admitted to the meeting. If you are a proxy holder for a stockholder, you will need to bring a validly executed proxy naming you as the proxy holder, together with proof of record ownership of the stockholder naming you as proxy holder. Please note that you may be asked to present valid photo identification, such as a valid driver's license or passport, when you check in for registration. No cameras, recording equipment or other electronic devices will be allowed to be brought into the meeting room by stockholders or beneficial owners.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner through a brokerage account or other arrangement with a holder of record?
If your shares are registered in your name with McDermott's transfer agent and registrar, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are the "stockholder of record" of those shares. The Notice and the proxy materials have been provided or made available directly to you by McDermott.

 OTHER INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" but not the holder of record of those shares, and the Notice and the proxy materials have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet.
How do I cast my vote?Most stockholders can vote by proxy in three ways:
If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting or vote now by giving us your proxy via Internet, telephone or mail. You may give us your proxy by following the instructions included in the Notice or, if you received a printed version of these proxy materials, in the enclosed proxy card. If you want to vote by mail but have not received a printed version of these proxy materials, you may request a full packet of proxy materials by following the instructions in the Notice. If you vote using either the telephone or the Internet, you will save us mailing expenses.
By giving us your proxy, you will be directing us how to vote your shares at the meeting. Even if you plan on attending the meeting, we urge you to vote now by giving us your proxy. This will ensure that your vote is represented at the meeting. If you do attend the meeting, you can change your vote at that time, if you then desire to do so.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares, but not the holder of record, you should refer to the instructions provided by your broker or nominee for further information. The broker or nominee that holds your shares has the authority to vote them, absent your approval, only as to matters for which they have discretionary authority under the applicable NYSE rules. Neither the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation nor the approval of the 2019 LTIP are considered routine matters. That means that brokers may not vote your shares with respect to those matters if you have not given your broker specific instructions as to how to vote. Please be sure to give specific voting instructions to your broker.
If you received a printed version of these proxy materials, you should have received a voting instruction form from your broker or nominee that holds your shares. For shares of which you are the beneficial owner but not the holder of record, follow the instructions contained in the Notice or voting instruction form to vote by Internet, telephone or mail. If you want to vote by mail but have not received a printed version of these proxy materials, you may request a full packet of proxy materials as instructed by the Notice. If you want to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker or nominee. You should contact your broker or nominee or refer to the instructions provided by your broker or nominee for further information. Additionally, the availability of telephone or Internet voting depends on the voting process used by the broker or nominee that holds your shares.
Why did I receive more than one Notice or proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?   You may receive more than one Notice, proxy statement, proxy card or voting instruction form if your shares are held through more than one account (e.g., through different brokers or nominees). Each proxy card or voting instruction form only covers those shares of common stock held in the applicable account. If you hold shares in more than one account, you will have to provide voting instructions as to each of your accounts in order to vote all your shares.
What is "householding"?   SEC rules regarding the delivery of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy statements and annual reports permit us, in specified circumstances, to deliver a single set of these materials to any address at which two or more stockholders reside. This method of delivery, often referred to as "householding," will reduce the amount of duplicative information that stockholders receive and lower printing and mailing costs for us. Each stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 OTHER INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
We have delivered only one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to eligible stockholders who are the beneficial owner of shares who share an address, unless contrary instructions were received from any such stockholder prior to the mailing date. We will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of such document was delivered. Any stockholder who would like to receive a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials should submit this request to McDermott's Corporate Secretary: (1) at the following address: McDermott International, Inc., 757 N. Eldridge Pkwy., Houston, Texas 77079, Attn: Corporate Secretary; or (2) by calling (281)870-5000. Beneficial owners sharing an address who receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and who would like to receive a single copy of such materials in the future will need to contact their broker, bank or other nominee to request that only a single copy of such document be mailed to all stockholders at the shared address in the future.
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote?   If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote by written notice to our Corporate Secretary, by granting a new proxy before the Annual Meeting or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Unless you attend the meeting and vote your shares in person, you should change your vote before the meeting using the same method (by Internet, telephone or mail) that you first used to vote your shares. That way, the inspector of election for the meeting will be able to verify your latest vote.
If you are the beneficial owner, but not the holder of record, of shares, you should follow the instructions in the information provided by your broker or nominee to change your vote before the meeting. If you want to change your vote as to shares of which you are the beneficial owner by voting in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from the broker or nominee that holds those shares for you.
What is a broker non-vote?   If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker or other holder of record, you must instruct the broker or other holder of record how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the broker or other holder of record can include your shares as being present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under the rules of the NYSE.
For this Annual Meeting, if you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held by a broker or other holder of record, your broker or other holder of record has discretionary voting authority under NYSE rules to vote your shares on the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, even if it has not received voting instructions from you. However, such holder does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation or the approval of the 2019 LTIP without instructions from you, in which case a broker non-vote will result and your shares will not be voted on those matters.
What is the quorum for the Annual Meeting?   The Annual Meeting will be held only if a quorum exists. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock as of the Record Date will constitute a quorum. If you attend the meeting or vote your shares by Internet, telephone or mail, your shares will be counted toward a quorum, even if you abstain from voting on a particular matter. Broker non-votes will be treated as present for the purpose of determining a quorum.
Which items will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?   At the Annual Meeting, we are asking you to vote on the following:

 OTHER INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
We are not aware of any other matters that may be presented or acted on at the Annual Meeting. If you vote by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card or using the telephone or Internet voting procedures, the individuals named as proxies on the card may vote your shares, in their discretion, on any other matter requiring a stockholder vote that comes before the meeting.
What are the Board's voting recommendations?   For the reasons set forth in more detail previously in this proxy statement, our Board recommends a vote:
What are the voting requirements to elect the Directors and to approve each of the proposals discussed in this proxy statement?
Each proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote and actually voting on the matter. Because votes withheld in the election of any director, abstentions and broker non-votes are not actual votes with respect to a proposal, they will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on any proposal.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, the Board expects any incumbent director nominee who does not receive "FOR" votes by a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote and either voting "FOR" or registering a decision to withhold a vote with respect to the election of such director to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Governance Committee, subject to acceptance by our Board. Any shares subject to broker non-votes shall not be considered in making any determination pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The Governance Committee will then make a recommendation to the Board with respect to the director nominee's resignation and the Board will consider the recommendation and take appropriate action within 120 days from the date of the certification of the election results.
What happens if I do not specify a choice for a proposal when returning a proxy or do not cast my vote?   You should specify your choice for each proposal on your proxy card or voting instruction form. Shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions given by the stockholders.
If you are a stockholder of record and your proxy card is signed and returned without voting instructions, it will be voted according to the recommendations of our Board. If you do not return your proxy card or cast your vote, no votes will be cast on your behalf on any of the items of business at the Annual Meeting.
If you are the beneficial owner, but not the holder of record, of shares and fail to provide voting instructions, your broker or other holder of record is permitted to vote your shares on the ratification of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, absent instructions from you, your broker or other holder of record may not vote on the election of directors or the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation, and no votes will be cast on your behalf for those matters.
Is my vote confidential?   All voted proxies and ballots will be handled in a manner intended to protect your voting privacy as a stockholder. Your vote will not be disclosed except:

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
McDermott cautions that the statements in this proxy statement which are forward-looking, and provide other than historical information, involve risks, contingencies and uncertainties that may impact actual results of operations of McDermott. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about backlog, to the extent backlog may be viewed as an indicator of future revenues, and about the expected benefits resulting from McDermott's combination with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. and McDermott's strategic objectives. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct. Those statements are made by using various underlying assumptions and are subject to numerous risks, contingencies and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including, among others: the possibility that the expected synergies from the combination will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period; difficulties related to the integration of the two companies; the diversion of management time and attention on the post-combination integration efforts; adverse changes in the markets in which McDermott operates or credit markets; our credit ratings; the inability of McDermott to execute on contracts in backlog successfully; changes in project design or schedules; the availability of qualified personnel; changes in the terms, scope or timing of contracts; contract cancellations; change orders and other modifications and actions by customers and other business counterparties of McDermott; changes in industry norms; and adverse outcomes in legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings or enforcement matters. If one or more of these risks materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors, please see McDermott's annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Except to the extent required by applicable law, McDermott undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement.

 ADMINISTRATION 
3.1  The Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The members of the Committee shall be appointed from time to time by, and shall serve at the discretion of, the Board of Directors. 
3.2  Authority of the Committee. Except as limited by law or by the Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company (each as amended from time to time), the Committee shall have full and exclusive power and authority to take all actions specifically contemplated by this Plan or that are necessary or appropriate in connection with the administration hereof and shall also have full and exclusive power and authority to interpret this Plan and to adopt such rules, regulations and guidelines for carrying out this Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or proper. The Committee shall have full power and sole discretion to: select Officers, Directors, Consultants and Employees who shall be granted Awards under this Plan; determine the sizes and types of Awards; determine the time when Awards are to be granted and any conditions that must be satisfied before an Award is granted; determine the terms and conditions of Awards in a manner consistent with this Plan; determine whether the conditions for earning an Award have been met and whether a Performance-Based Award will be paid at the end of an applicable performance period; determine the guidelines and/or procedures for the payment or exercise of Awards; and determine whether a Performance-Based Award should qualify, regardless of its amount, as deductible in its entirety for federal income tax purposes, including whether a Performance-Based Award granted to an Officer should qualify as performance-based compensation. Notwithstanding Section 4.4, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting or exercisability of an Award, eliminate or make less restrictive any restrictions contained in an Award, waive any restriction or other provision of this Plan or any Award or otherwise amend or modify any Award in any manner that is either (a) not adverse to the Participant to whom such Award was granted or (b) consented to in writing by such Participant, and (c) consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the provisions of Section 4.3 hereof, the terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended without the approval of the Company's stockholders so as to (i) reduce the Option Price of any outstanding Option, (ii) cancel any outstanding Option in exchange for cash or other Awards (including substitutions and cash buyouts) or for an Option with an Option Price that is less than the Option Price of the original Option, (iii) permit repurchase from Participants, whether for cash or any other consideration, of any outstanding Options that have an Option Price greater than the then current Fair Market Value of a Share, or (iv) permit the grant of any Option that contains a so-called "reload" feature under which additional Options or other Awards are granted automatically to the Participant upon exercise of the original Option. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in this Plan or in any Award in the manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or desirable to further this Plan's objectives. Further, the Committee shall make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan. As permitted by law and the terms of this Plan, the Committee may delegate its authority as identified herein. 
3.3  Delegation of Authority.

 SHARES SUBJECT TO THIS PLAN 
4.1  Number of Shares Available for Grants of Awards. Subject to adjustment as provided below in this Section 4.1 and in Section 4.3 hereof, there is reserved for issuance of Awards under this Plan 2,475,000 plus the number of Shares available for grant pursuant to the Prior Plans but which have not yet been made subject to awards granted under the Prior Plans (the "Maximum Share Limitation") all of which shall be available for Incentive Stock Options, as well as any other form of Award. Each Award settled in Shares and each Option shall be counted against the Maximum Share Limitation as one Share. If an Award under this Plan or the Prior Plans expires or is terminated, cancelled or forfeited, the Shares associated with the expired, terminated, cancelled or forfeited Award shall again be available for Awards under this Plan, and the Maximum Share Limitation shall be increased by the same amount as such Shares were counted against the Maximum Share Limitation (under this Plan or the Prior Plans, as applicable). Upon shareholder approval of this Plan, no additional grants will be made pursuant to the Prior Plans. In the discretion of the Committee, an award granted under the Prior Plans may be settled in Shares issued pursuant to this Plan, and the Shares subject to such award will be counted against the Maximum Share Limitation in the same manner as if such shares had been issued pursuant to the Prior Plans. Shares that are tendered by a Participant or withheld as full or partial payment of withholding taxes related to the vesting or settlement of an Award other than Options shall become available again for Awards under this Plan. The following Shares shall not become available again for Awards under this Plan: 
 (i)  Shares that are tendered by a Participant or withheld (1) as full or partial payment of withholding taxes related to the exercise or settlement of Options, or (2) as payment for the Option Price of an Option; and 
 (ii)  Shares repurchased in the open market with the proceeds of the payment of the Option Price of an Option. 
  The foregoing notwithstanding, subject to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, the Maximum Share Limitation shall not be reduced by (x) Shares issued under Awards granted in assumption, substitution or exchange for previously granted awards of a company acquired by the Company or, to the extent allowed under applicable law and stock exchange requirements, otherwise a party to a transaction with the Company resulting in an adjustment of shares pursuant to Section 4.3 and (y) available shares under a stockholder approved plan of an acquired company (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the transaction) and such shares shall be available for Awards under this Plan. The Committee may from time to time adopt and observe such procedures concerning the counting of Shares against this Plan maximum as it may deem appropriate. 
4.2  Limits on Director Grants in Any Fiscal Year. The aggregate grant date fair value of Awards to any individual Director, who is not an Employee on the date of grant, in any one Fiscal Year shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). 
4.3  Adjustments in Authorized Shares. The existence of outstanding Awards shall not affect in any manner the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the capital stock of the Company or its business or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock (whether or not such issue is prior to, on a parity with or junior to the Shares) or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding of any kind, whether or not of a character similar to that of the acts or proceedings enumerated above. If there shall be any change in the Shares of the Company or the capitalization of the Company through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, dividend in kind or other like change in capital structure or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to stockholders of the Company, the Committee, in its sole discretion, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under this Plan, shall adjust, in such manner as it deems equitable, as applicable, the number and kind of Shares that may be granted as Awards under this Plan, the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding Awards, the exercise or other price applicable to outstanding Awards, the Fair Market Value of the Shares and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. In the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall be authorized, in its sole discretion, to: (a) grant or assume Awards by means of substitution of new Awards, as appropriate, for previously granted Awards or to assume previously granted Awards as part of such adjustment; (b) make provision, prior to the 
4.3  Adjustments in Authorized Shares. The existence of outstanding Awards shall not affect in any manner the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the capital stock of the Company or its business or any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock (whether or not such issue is prior to, on a parity with or junior to the Shares) or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding of any kind, whether or not of a character similar to that of the acts or proceedings enumerated above. If there shall be any change in the Shares of the Company or the capitalization of the Company through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, dividend in kind or other like change in capital structure or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to stockholders of the Company, the Committee, in its sole discretion, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under this Plan, shall adjust, in such manner as it deems equitable, as applicable, the number and kind of Shares that may be granted as Awards under this Plan, the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding Awards, the exercise or other price applicable to outstanding Awards, the Fair Market Value of the Shares and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. In the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall be authorized, in its sole discretion, to: (a) grant or assume Awards by means of substitution of new Awards, as appropriate, for previously granted Awards or to assume previously granted Awards as part of such adjustment; (b) make provision, prior to the mcdermott.com             99

  transaction, for the acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of, or lapse of restrictions with respect to, Awards and the termination of Options that remain unexercised at the time of such transaction; (c) provide for the acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of Options and the cancellation thereof in exchange for such payment as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines is a reasonable approximation of the value thereof; (d) cancel any Awards and direct the Company to deliver to the Participants who are the holders of such Awards cash in an amount that the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion is equal to the fair market value of such Awards as of the date of such event, which, in the case of any Option, shall be the amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of such date over the per-share Option Price for such Option (for the avoidance of doubt, if such Option Price is less than such Fair Market Value, the Option may be canceled for no consideration); or (e) cancel Awards that are Options and give the Participants who are the holders of such Awards notice and opportunity to exercise prior to such cancellation. 
4.4  Minimum Vesting. Subject to Section 4.3 hereof, other than in the event of an earlier death or Disability, all Awards shall have a minimum Vesting Period of one year from the date of its grant and no portion or installment of an Award shall vest until one year from the date of grant; provided, however, that Awards with respect to up to five percent (5%) of the Shares authorized for grant pursuant to this Plan may have a Vesting Period of less than one year; provided, however, that awards to Directors who are not employees shall not count against the shares available for this exception even if the vesting period is less than one year from the grant date, but not less than 50 weeks, so long as such Awards are granted in connection with the regular annual meeting of stockholders and vest at the next regular annual meeting of stockholders following the grant.

Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee shall have discretion in determining the number of Shares subject to Options granted to each Participant. 
6.2  Option Award Agreement. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Option Price, the duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option pertains, and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine that are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan.

6.3  Option Price. The Option Price for each grant of an Option under this Plan shall be as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that, subject to any subsequent adjustment that may be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.3 hereof, the Option Price shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted.

No Option may contain a right to dividend equivalents.

8.2  Value of Performance Units/Shares. Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the Committee at the time of grant. Each  Performance Share shall represent the right to receive a Share subject to the satisfaction of relevant performance conditions. The Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion that, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine  the number and/or value of Performance Units/Shares which will be paid out to the Participant. 
8.3  Earning of Performance Units/Shares. Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance  Units/Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the number and value of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have  been achieved. 
8.4  Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares. Subject to the provisions of Article 12 hereof, Payment of earned  Performance Units/Shares to a Participant shall be made no later than March 15 following the end of the calendar year in which such Performance Units/Shares vest, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter if  payment is delayed due to unforeseeable events. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash or in Shares (or in a combination thereof) that have an aggregate Fair  Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period. Any Shares issued or transferred to a Participant for this purpose may be granted subject to any restrictions that are deemed  appropriate by the Committee. 
8.5  Voting Rights and Dividends. During the applicable Vesting Period, Participants holding Performance Unit/Shares shall not have voting rights with respect to  the Shares, if any, underlying such Performance Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, a Performance Unit/Share shall not convey any rights as a stockholder until Shares are issued and delivered to the Participant. During the applicable Vesting Period,  Participants holding Performance Units/Shares granted hereunder may be credited with dividend equivalents, in the form of cash or additional Performance Units/Shares (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), if a cash dividend is paid with  respect to the Shares. The extent to which dividend equivalents shall be credited shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Such dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same vesting restrictions and performance restrictions as the  Performance Units/Shares with respect to which the dividend equivalents are paid.

ARTICLE 11
Awards under this Plan are not transferable (either voluntarily or involuntarily), before or after Participant's death, except as follows: (a) during Participant's lifetime, pursuant to a domestic relations order, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, that is not contrary to the terms and conditions of this Plan or the applicable Award Agreement, and in a form acceptable to the Committee, in its sole discretion; or (b) after Participant's death, by will or pursuant to the applicable laws of descent and distribution, as may be the case. Any person to whom an Award is transferred in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence shall take such Award subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, including that the vesting and termination provisions thereof will continue to be applied with respect to the Participant. Options are exercisable only by the applicable Participant (or, during the Participant's lifetime, by the Participant's court appointed legal representative) or a person to whom the Options have been transferred in accordance with this Article. The Committee may prescribe and include in applicable Award Agreements other restrictions on transfer. Any attempted assignment that is in violation of this Article 11 shall be null and void.
ARTICLE 12
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit selected Participants to elect to defer payment of some or all types of Awards, or may provide for the deferral of an Award in an Award Agreement; provided, however, that the timing of any such election and payment of any such deferral shall be specified in the Award Agreement and shall conform to the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) and the regulations and rulings issued thereunder. Any deferred payment, whether elected by a Participant or specified in an Award Agreement or by the Committee, may be forfeited if and to the extent that the applicable Award Agreement so provides.

13.1  Employment or Service. Nothing in this Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment  or service at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company. 
13.2  No Contract of Employment. Neither an Award nor any benefits arising under this Plan shall constitute part of a Participant's employment contract with  the Company or any Subsidiary, and accordingly, subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof, this Plan and the benefits hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Board without giving rise to liability on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary for severance payments. 
13.3  Transfers Between Participating Entities. For purposes of this Plan, a transfer of a Participant's employment between the Company and a Subsidiary, or  between Subsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment. Upon such a transfer, the Committee may make such adjustments to outstanding Awards as it deems appropriate to reflect the change in reporting  relationships. 
[END TABLE]
ARTICLE 14
Notwithstanding Section 4.4 or any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the provisions of this Article 14 shall apply in the event of a Change in Control, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, or as provided in an individual severance or employment agreement to which a Participant is a party.

ARTICLE 16
The Company shall have the right to deduct applicable taxes from any Award payment and withhold, at the time of delivery or vesting of cash or Shares under this Plan, or at the time applicable law otherwise requires, an appropriate amount of cash or number of Shares or a combination thereof for payment of taxes required by law or to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for withholding of such taxes. The Committee may permit withholding to be satisfied by the transfer to the Company of Shares theretofore owned by the holder of the Award with respect to which withholding is required. If Shares are used to satisfy tax withholding, such Shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date when the tax withholding is required to be made.
ARTICLE 17
Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom the Committee has delegated authority in accordance with Article 3 hereof, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from: (a) any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan, except for any such action or failure to act that constitutes willful misconduct on the part of such person or as to which any applicable statute prohibits the Company from providing indemnification; and (b) any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement of any claim, action, suit or proceeding as to which indemnification is provided pursuant to clause (a) of this sentence, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment or award in any such action, suit or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf.
The foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition to any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-Laws (each, as amended from time to time), as a matter of law, or otherwise.
ARTICLE 18
All obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the direct or indirect result of a merger, consolidation, purchase of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or other transaction.
