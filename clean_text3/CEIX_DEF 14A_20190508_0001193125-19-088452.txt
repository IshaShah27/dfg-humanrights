Dear Fellow Stockholder: 
On behalf of the entire Board of Directors of CONSOL Energy Inc. (CEIX), we invite you to attend CEIX's second Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Annual Meeting will be held on May 8, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, Earhart Room (CD), 1111 Airport Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15231. 
You will be asked to vote on several items at the Annual Meeting, including the election of our Class II directors, ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and advisory approval of our 2018 executive compensation program. Detailed information about the director nominees, including their specific experience and qualifications, begins on page 10 of the proxy statement. Information about our independent registered public accounting firm begins on page 13 of the proxy statement. Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which explains our 2018 compensation decisions, begins on page 20 of the proxy statement. We encourage you to read the proxy statement carefully for more information. 
During our first full calendar year as an independent publicly traded coal company, we adopted a new mission statement: To improve lives and communities by safely and compliantly producing affordable, reliable energy and profitably growing through innovative technology and perseverance. We achieved our key strategic and financial priorities of improving our balance sheet, returning capital to our stockholders, and improving our rate of returns through our disciplined capital allocation process. To do so, we capitalized on rising seaborne coal markets to secure a large multi-year export contract for our Pennsylvania Mining Complex (PAMC) as well as a take-or-pay contract at our CONSOL Marine Terminal (CMT). As domestic markets improved later in the year, we opportunistically secured several longer-term contracts with our key top-performing power plant customers in the Northern Appalachian rail market. Our two operating assets, the PAMC and the CMT, both had record-breaking 2018 performance. The PAMC produced 27.6 million tons of coal, representing a new record and its third consecutive year of production growth, and the CMT achieved a new annual revenue record. We also made significant improvements on the safety front. On a year-over-year basis, we reduced our total recordable incident rate at the PAMC by 13.5% and reduced our total number of exceptions by 12.1%. The CMT continued its outstanding safety performance, with zero incidents and a 100% compliance record during 2018. Overall, we generated $413.5 million in net cash provided by operations and $248 million in free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders*, de-levered the balance sheet by 0.7x, and allocated capital to a basket of higher-return areas to help boost our year-end 2018 return on capital employed to 15%. 
Looking forward, our strategic priorities are very clear. We are focused on: (a) generating free cash flow, which will be used to reduce debt and increase equity value, (b) selectively pursuing growth opportunities that diversify our product mix and market reach and increase our value per share, (c) improving stockholder returns by being rate of return-driven in our capital allocation process, (d) returning capital to stockholders through dividends and buybacks and (e) embracing technology and other productivity-enhancing techniques to safely and compliantly increase our product margins. Our goal is to deliver strong and consistent financial performance for our stockholders throughout the commodity cycles via return-focused capital allocation and the safe, compliant operation of a well-capitalized portfolio of assets. 
We are making our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting available to you via the Internet. We hope that this offers you convenience while allowing us to reduce the number of copies that we print. 
Your vote is important to us. We hope that you will participate in the Annual Meeting, either by attending and voting in person or by voting as promptly as possible through the Internet, by telephone or by completing and mailing a proxy card (following the process as further described in the proxy statement). Detailed instructions on "How to Vote" begin on page 7. 
If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, please bring a valid government-issued photo identification. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, please also bring with you a letter (and a legal proxy if you wish to vote your shares) from your bank, broker or nominee confirming your ownership as of the record date. 
Thank you for your investment in CEIX, and we hope you will be able to join us at this year's Annual Meeting.

Proxy Summary 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Our Board and management are committed to strong corporate governance, which promotes the long-term interests of stockholders, strengthens Board and management accountability and helps build public trust in our new public company. This Proxy Statement describes our governance framework, which includes the following highlights: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Directors. A majority of our directors must be independent. Currently, all of our directors other  than our President and Chief Executive Officer, are independent, and our Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Compensation Committees consist exclusively of independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Majority Voting Requirement. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "bylaws") require that any nominee  for election to the Board who does not receive a majority of the votes cast in favor of that director's election to the Board in an uncontested election must tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance  Committee will make a recommendation on the tendered resignation, and the Board then will accept or reject the offer of resignation within 90 days.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Phase-Out of Classified Board. Our organizational documents include a  plan to phase-out our classified Board structure by 2023. Starting in 2023, all of our directors will be subject to annual re-election to the Board.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Chair; Lead Director. Currently, our Chair of the Board is independent of management. In addition, in  the event that our Chief Executive Officer would also serve as the Chair, our corporate governance guidelines require a Lead Director position with specific responsibilities to ensure independent oversight of management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Regular Meetings of Independent Directors. Our independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions with no  members of management present.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Robust Strategy, Risk and Safety Oversight by Board and Committees. Our Board and committees have implemented a  robust framework to actively oversee the strategy and risks relating to the operation and management of an independent, publicly traded coal company. In addition, our Board has a strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the environments in  which we operate and has formed a separate Board level committee to oversee that value of CEIX.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diversity on Board. We believe in diversity and value the benefits diversity can bring to our Board. In 2018, our  Board adopted a policy regarding diversity of its members. Effective March 1, 2019, Sophie Bergeron was elected as a Class I director to fill the vacancy resulting from a retiring director.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Emphasis on Ethics Compliance. We believe strongly in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and training and  awareness surrounding the CONSOL Ethics Compliance Hotline. As a result, effective January 1, 2019, we updated the Code to include more specificity around the hotline, implemented a training program in which 100% of our salaried workforce  participated, and emphasized the importance of Code compliance and the hotline availability in our annual letter to our vendors. It is our policy to comply with all applicable laws and adhere to the highest level of ethical conduct, including  anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) and similar laws in other jurisdictions. In that regard, in 2018 we adopted a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Policy that has been distributed to all of our employees,  directors and officers. In addition to these persons certifying compliance with the policy, we provide training on compliance with the FCPA and our policy. It is important that all of our business activities reflect our commitment to the  highest standards of integrity and accountability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines. As further described beginning on page 32, our Board has adopted stock  ownership and retention guidelines that apply to the Board and our executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proactive Stockholder Outreach. Our management team spends a significant amount of time meeting and speaking to  our stockholder base. We have initiated an integrated effort to interact and receive feedback from the proxy teams at our stockholder base to incorporate best governance, compensation, and oversight practices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sustainability. We provide transparency into our operations through the regular publishing of corporate  sustainability reports. Through our former parent company, our operations have been covered in an annual Corporate Responsibility Report every year since 2012. Our first stand-alone Corporate Sustainability Report was published in February 2019 and  is available on our website. Copies of our Corporate Sustainability Report will be available at the Annual Meeting.

Our policy addresses promoting health and safety,  eliminating compulsory labor and human trafficking, abolishing child labor, eliminating harassment and unlawful discrimination in the workplace and providing competitive compensation.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
PROXY MATERIALS AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING: We mailed to all stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting the Internet Notice on or about March 27, 2019. 
We are utilizing a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials via the Internet rather than in paper form. This rule allows a company to send some or all of its stockholders the Internet Notice regarding Internet availability of proxy materials. The Internet Notice contains instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or how to request a paper copy of proxy materials. 
An electronic copy of this Proxy Statement, the 2018 Annual Report and the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders are available at www.edocumentview.com/CEIX. 
Copies of our 2018 Annual Report furnished to our stockholders do not contain copies of exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. You can obtain copies of these exhibits electronically at the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov or by mail from the Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549 at prescribed rates. The exhibits are also available as part of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 which is available on CEIX's corporate website at www.consolenergy.com. Stockholders may also obtain copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, or the exhibits thereto, without charge by contacting our Investor Relations department at CONSOL Energy Inc., Investor Relations department, 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, Telephone (724) 416-8300. 
RECORD DATE AND QUORUM: The record date with respect to this solicitation is March 11, 2019. All holders of record of CEIX common stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the record date, CEIX had 27,607,517 shares of common stock outstanding. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote for each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. In order to hold the Annual Meeting, a quorum representing the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy. 
PROXIES AND VOTING: A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the CEIX common shares that you owned as of the record date. The person that you designate to vote your shares is called a "proxy" and when you designate someone to vote your shares in a written document, that document is also called a "proxy" or "proxy card". The Board has appointed several officers of the company to serve as proxies on the proxy card. 
If a proxy is properly executed and is not revoked by the stockholder, the shares it represents will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions provided by the stockholder. If a proxy card is signed and returned without specifying choices, the shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Accordingly, if no contrary instructions are given, the proxies named by the Board intend to vote the shares represented by such proxies as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in favor of the election of those persons nominated as set forth in this Proxy Statement to serve as Class II  directors of CEIX (Proposal No. 1);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in favor of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public  accounting firm of CEIX for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in favor of approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018 (Proposal  No. 3); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in accordance with their judgment on any other matters which may properly come before the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
The Board does not know of any other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting other than as indicated in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
HOW TO VOTE: There are four ways for stockholders of record to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• VIA THE INTERNET BY PROXY: Stockholders who have received the Internet Notice by mail may submit proxies over the  Internet by following the instructions on the Internet Notice. Stockholders who received a voting instruction form by mail or e-mail from their bank, broker or other nominee may submit proxies over the  Internet by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by their bank, broker or other nominee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• VIA TELEPHONE BY PROXY: Registered stockholders of record may submit proxies by telephone by calling 1-800-652-8683 and following the instructions. Stockholders must have the 15-digit control  number that appears on their Internet Notice when voting. Stockholders who have received a voting instruction form by mail or e-mail from their bank, broker or other nominee should check the voting instruction  form for telephone voting availability. If available, those stockholders may vote by phone by calling the number specified on the voting instruction form provided by the bank, broker or other nominee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• VIA MAIL BY PROXY: Stockholders who have received a paper copy of a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail  may submit proxies by completing, signing and dating their proxy card or voting instruction form and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• IN PERSON AT ANNUAL MEETING: Stockholders of record may vote in person at the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP AND BROKER NON-VOTES: If you hold shares beneficially in street name, then you must provide your voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares may be treated as "broker non-votes." 
Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a bank, broker or other nominee is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and such instructions are not given. Banks, brokers or other nominees that have not received voting instructions from their clients cannot vote on their clients' behalf on "non-routine" proposals, such as Proposal Nos. 1 and 3, although they may vote their clients' shares on "routine matters," such as Proposal No. 2. 
REVOCATION OF PROXY: If you are the stockholder of record of shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date, you can revoke your proxy at any time before its exercise by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sending a written notice to CEIX at 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, attention:  Secretary, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, that is received prior to the Annual Meeting, stating that you revoke your proxy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting your voting instructions again by telephone or over the Internet;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• signing another valid proxy card bearing a later date than the proxy initially received and mailing it so that it is  received by CEIX prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must follow the instructions found on your voting instruction form, or contact your bank, broker or other nominee, in order to revoke your previously delivered proxy. Attendance at the Annual Meeting without a request to revoke a proxy will not by itself revoke a previously executed and delivered proxy. 
ATTENDING THE MEETING IN PERSON: Subject to space availability, all stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Annual Meeting in person. Because seating is limited, admission to the meeting will be on a first come, first served basis. 
Registration will begin at 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Stockholders who attend may be asked to present valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the Annual Meeting. Please also note that if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a bank, broker or other nominee), a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date must be provided during check-in at the registration desk at the Annual Meeting. 
If you require directions to the Annual Meeting, please contact CEIX's Investor Relations department at (724) 416-8300. 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
PROXY SOLICITATION: All costs relating to the solicitation of proxies will be borne by CEIX. Georgeson LLC has been retained by CEIX to aid in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $9,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited by officers, directors and employees personally, by mail, or by telephone, facsimile transmission or other electronic means. None of these directors, officers or employees will receive any additional or special compensation for soliciting proxies. Upon request, CEIX will reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees for their reasonable expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are beneficial owners of CEIX's common stock. 
SECRECY IN VOTING: As a matter of policy, proxies, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are held confidentially by CEIX. Such documents are available for examination only by the inspectors of election and certain employees who assist in the tabulation of votes. The vote of any individual stockholder will not be disclosed except as may be necessary to meet applicable legal requirements.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended, and the Board has nominated, our current Class II directors, Joseph P. Platt and Edwin S. Roberson, whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting, for re-election by the stockholders as Class II directors at the Annual Meeting. Upon election, each such director will serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor is elected and qualified, or his earlier death, resignation or removal. 
To be elected, each nominee must receive a plurality of the votes cast (i.e., the director nominees who receive the highest number of "for" votes cast, up to the maximum number of directors to be elected, are elected as directors). If any nominee should for any reason become unable to serve, all shares represented by valid proxies will be voted for the election of such other person as the Board may designate, as recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Alternatively, the Board may reduce the number of directors to eliminate the vacancy. 
Our bylaws provide that if an incumbent director receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such director nominee's election, the director must tender his or her resignation promptly to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision and the underlying rationale in a press release, a filing with the SEC or other broadly disseminated means of communication within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. 
The biographies included in this Proxy Statement below include information concerning the nominees for director and the continuing directors, including their recent employment, positions with CEIX, other directorships, board committee memberships and ages as of March 11, 2019.

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of CEIX's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for CEIX for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The Board now recommends that CEIX's stockholders ratify this appointment. 
Neither CEIX's governing documents nor the law require stockholder ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Board is submitting the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of CEIX and its stockholders. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to address the meeting and respond to appropriate questions. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"), CEIX's independent registered public accounting firm, the audited financial statements of CEIX for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Audited Financial Statements"). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with E&Y the matters required to be discussed under the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") (Auditing Standard No. 1301 –Communications with Audit Committees) relating to the conduct of the audit, including any difficulties encountered in the course of the audit work, any restrictions on the scope of the registered public accounting firm's activities or access to requested information and any significant disagreements with management. 
The Audit Committee also has received the written disclosures and letter from E&Y regarding E&Y's independence required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence from CEIX and its subsidiaries. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Audited Financial Statements be included in CEIX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), CEIX is required to provide its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on compensation paid to our named executive officers. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote, on an advisory basis, "FOR" the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, and to adopt the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to CEIX's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED on an advisory basis." 
As described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain key executives who drive our success and industry leadership. We achieve these objectives through compensation that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• links a significant portion of total compensation to performance, which we believe will create long-term stockholder  value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• includes stock-based compensation, which encourages our named executive officers to act as owners of CEIX;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is tied to overall corporate performance, and financial and operational goals (annual and long-term);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• enhances retention in a highly competitive market by subjecting a significant portion of total compensation to  multi-year vesting or performance conditions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discourages unnecessary and excessive risk-taking; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provides a competitive total pay opportunity.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation programs for our executive officers to ensure they achieve the desired goal of aligning our executive compensation structure with our stockholders' interests and current market practices. Please read "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 20, and the tabular compensation disclosures and accompanying narrative discussion beginning on page 34. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis discusses our executive compensation philosophy, programs and objectives, while the tabular compensation disclosures and accompanying narrative discussion provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018 as described in this Proxy Statement (including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and other related compensation disclosures required by Regulation S-K Item 402 and contained herein). This proposal is intended to give our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation paid to our named executive officers, and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
As an advisory vote, your vote will not be binding on CEIX, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, our Board and our Compensation Committee, which are responsible for designing and administering CEIX's executive compensation program, value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018, we will consider our stockholders' concerns, if any, and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
After our stockholders voted in 2018, on an advisory basis, on the frequency of this advisory vote on compensation, the Company elected to hold future advisory votes on compensation on an annual basis until the next stockholder advisory vote on frequency, which we expect will be conducted at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2024. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2018, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT, PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC.

Say-on-Pay Vote 
We took into consideration the results of the say-on-pay voting by our stockholders last year when reviewing our current policies and practices related to compensation of our NEOs. Of the 23,189,928 million votes cast by our stockholders, over 95% were in favor of our 2017 executive compensation program. While we believe we have a fair and effective compensation program, we are gratified to receive the vote of confidence from our stockholders. We therefore determined not to make any significant changes to our current compensation program. We commit to staying up-to-date on recommended best practices where practicable. Finally, our Compensation Committee and senior management will also continue to consider stockholder input, including the advisory say-on-pay vote, as we evaluate the future design of our executive compensation programs and the specific compensation decisions for each of our NEOs. 
CEIX Executive Compensation Policies and Practices 
Our commitment to strong corporate governance practices extends to the compensation plans, principles, programs and policies established by our Compensation Committee and our Board, which include the following governance practices and policies:

CEIX Executive Compensation Philosophy 
Our compensation philosophy is designed to attract and retain key talent necessary for us to compete, promote a pay-for-performance culture, incentivize our NEOs to achieve desired financial and operating results, and create a balanced compensation program that aligns risk-taking with the sustainability and long-term financial health of our company. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Our philosophy is founded on the following six guiding principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation targets and the mix of pay based on market practices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Actual compensation should align with results against performance objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentives should promote above-median pay when performance exceeds company and peer expectations and below-median pay  when performance lags behind these indicators.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation should be aligned with the long-term interest of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation practices and policies should not encourage unreasonable risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation programs should align with our corporate values.  
[END TABLE]
Our compensation philosophy also reflects our commitment to enhancing management retention and leadership stability in a highly competitive market by subjecting a significant portion of total compensation to multi-year vesting or performance conditions described on pages 27-31, relating to our long-term compensation programs.

[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee and Management Roles. Our Compensation Committee requests that the CEO be present at committee meetings, where compensation and corporate performance are discussed and evaluated. The CEO is encouraged to provide insight, suggestions or recommendations regarding executive compensation if present during these meetings or at other times. However, only independent committee members are allowed to vote on decisions made regarding executive compensation. In making its determinations with respect to executive compensation, the committee is supported by CEIX's Chief Administrative Officer, its General Counsel and Mercer, the committee's independent compensation consultant. While the committee meets with the CEO to discuss his own compensation package, ultimately, decisions regarding the CEO's compensation are made by the committee in executive session without the CEO or any other executive officer present, solely based upon the committee's deliberations. Decisions regarding other NEOs who report directly to the CEO are also made by the committee (or Board, in the case of equity grants, absent a delegation to the committee or CEO) after considering recommendations from the CEO, Mercer and the Chief Administrative Officer. 
CEIX Compensation Consultant. Our Compensation Committee retained Mercer as an independent compensation consultant directly, although in carrying out its assignments, Mercer also interacts with CEIX management when necessary and appropriate. Specifically, the Chief Administrative Officer, responsible for Human Resources matters, including executive compensation, interacts with the consultant to provide compensation data, best practices data, and executive compensation trends. In addition, Mercer may, in its discretion, seek input and feedback from executives regarding its consulting work product prior to the presentation to the Compensation Committee to align with CEIX's business strategy, to determine that additional data may need to be gathered, or to identify other issues, if any, prior to the presentation to the Compensation Committee. Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews with management the independence of any compensation consultant it retains. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee conducted an independence review of Mercer by analyzing the factors mandated by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and concluded that there were no conflicts of interest arising from Mercer's work. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Compensation Discussion and Analysis
2018 Compensation Actions 
Increase in 2018 Base Salaries, 2018 STIC and LTIC Targets. In early 2018, our Compensation Committee approved increases in the base salaries of Messrs. Brock and Salvatori and Ms. Wiegand to reflect their increased roles and responsibilities and to ensure that such executives are compensated competitively in line with CEIX's Peer Group and general industry. The Compensation Committee also approved adjustments in the STIC and LTIC compensation targets for our NEOs to ensure that their short-term and long-term compensation opportunities are in line with the CEIX Peer Group and general industry. The base salaries and targets, expressed as a percentage of each NEO's base salary, are included in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name of Executive   Base Salary   2018 STIC   2018 LTIC 
 Mr. Brock       $650,000                 110%              350%       
 Mr. Khani       $530,566         70%       487% 
 Mr. McCaffrey       $389,500         50%       128% 
 Ms. Wiegand       $300,000         50%       42% 
 Mr. Salvatori       $270,000         50%       46% 
[END TABLE]
While the targets for all of our NEOs were reviewed, only the STIC targets (for Messrs. Brock and Salvatori and Ms. Wiegand) and LTIC targets (for Messrs. Brock, McCaffrey and Salvatori and Ms.  Wiegand) were adjusted during 2018. 
2018 Peer Group. The Compensation Committee selected the following 11 companies (the "Peer Group") based on the recommendation of Mercer, which includes companies in the coal and energy industry similar in revenue size to CEIX and with industry and business characteristics comparable to CEIX in terms of revenue and market cap and with whom we compete for talent. The Compensation Committee does not target a particular percentile within the Peer Group in setting an NEO's compensation, but uses the Peer Group compensation data as one of several reference points in determining the form and amount of compensation. The Compensation Committee also uses general industry competitive market data to evaluate our NEO total compensation packages. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Alliance Resources Partners, LP    Hallador Energy Inc. 
 Arch Coal Inc.    Louisiana-Pacific Corporation 
 Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.    Natural Resources Partners LP 
 Cloud Peak Energy Inc    Peabody Energy Corporation 
 Compass Minerals Inc.    Westmoreland Coal Company 
 Foresight Energy LP     
[END TABLE]
In early 2019, our Compensation Committee reviewed with Mercer the composition of our Peer Group and decided to eliminate two (2) members of the group, Westmoreland Coal Company and Cloud Peak Energy Inc. for equity valuation reasons in light of their respective financial challenges, the change to be effective for the 2019 year. At the same time the Compensation Committee decided to include newly publicly listed Warrior Met Coal Company Inc. as a new member of the Peer Group as it more accurately reflects our coal industry and more closely resembles our size in terms of revenue and market capitalization. 
2018 Short-Term Incentive Compensation (STIC). In January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved 2018 annual incentive awards for the performance period beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the payment of which was contingent on the company's successful achievement of performance goals related to operating margin and free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders, equally weighted, but subject to modification influenced by each NEO's contribution towards achieving environmental and safety initiatives, as determined by our President and CEO, and approved by our Compensation Committee. The STIC awards included threshold, target and maximum performance levels. The 2018 STIC performance factors had a potential score ranging from 0% – 200%, with a target score of 100%. If the threshold, or minimum, score of 50% had not been achieved, a score of zero would be assigned, with no payout. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Compensation Discussion and Analysis
For purposes of calculating the payouts for the 2018 STIC, operating margin means per ton sales price less per ton direct operating cost, and free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders means operating cash flow, plus monetization of non-earnings before-interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") producing assets, less organic capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Our Compensation Committee believes these performance goals encourage our NEOs to stay focused on operational and balance sheet strength. 
The 2018 STIC award payout formula appears below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Base Salary                X    Target Opportunity Percentage (% of Base Salary)   X            (+/- Up to 200% Modifiers)     =            2018 STIC Award Payout 
 Annual Base Salary                X    Target Opportunity Percentage (% of Base Salary)   X            (+/- Up to 200% Modifiers)     =            2018 STIC Award Payout 
 Annual Base Salary                X    Target Opportunity Percentage (% of Base Salary)   X            (+/- Up to 200% Modifiers)     =            2018 STIC Award Payout 
[END TABLE]
The performance goals are equally weighed at 45% with 10% allocated to individual NEO performance.

In February 2019, the Compensation Committee evaluated and determined achievement with the performance goals and the resulting amounts of payments for our NEOs under the 2018 STIC.

Additionally, the CONSOL Marine Terminal achieved record revenue of $64.9 million.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• David M. Khani. As our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Khani has played and continues to play a critical  role in supporting Mr. Brock's leadership of our company's business, and in light of his significant experience relating to the coal industry, he also serves as the Chief Financial Officer of the general partner of CCR. During 2018,  Mr. Khani led efforts to lower our cost of capital and refined the company's capital allocation process.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• James J. McCaffrey. As our Senior Vice President – Coal Marketing, Mr. McCaffrey  holds a critical role as the leader of the marketing team for our coal business, which recorded a 8% increase in realizations for 2018 versus 2017 results. Mr. McCaffrey's team built CEIX's coal sales portfolio for 2018 through 2020,  resulting in our company being greater than 95% contracted for 2019, 53% contracted for 2020, and 28% contracted for 2021, assuming an annual coal production rate of approximately 27 million tons.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Martha A. Wiegand. As the General Counsel and Secretary of CEIX and the general partner of  CCR, Ms. Wiegand has played a critical role in leading both internal and external teams of lawyers in her role of advising both boards on various corporate governance and other board-level issues, serves as the top legal advisor for the  Pennsylvania Mining Complex and oversees the companies' land, legal, health, safety and environmental, and internal audit functions. During the year Ms. Wiegand played a lead role in the company's legal and permitting issues related  to obtaining critical mining permits in order for the company to continue its mining efforts in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Kurt R. Salvatori. As our Chief Administrative Officer, Mr. Salvatori oversees the  company's Human Resource, Government Affairs, Information Technology and Public Relations functions. During 2018, these functions recorded material reductions in the company's long-term liability portfolio and implemented a new Enterprise  Resource Planning System for the company.  
[END TABLE]
2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation (LTIC). In January of 2018, our Compensation Committee designed the long-term program for our NEOs to include grants of PSUs and RSUs. The RSUs and PSUs both vest ratably over a three-year period, although vesting of the PSUs is subject to the company's satisfactory achievement of pre-established performance goals as follows:

[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee believes the PSUs and RSUs align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders because (1) the vesting of the RSUs increases executive stock ownership and supports executive retention, and (2) the vesting of the PSUs is tied to the achievement of pre-established goals related to our stock price and the sustained financial and operational stability of our company over the long-term. While most companies tie target relative TSR to peer group median performance, we have imposed a higher performance bar for target vesting. As described below, CEIX is required to perform above the median (60th percentile) to earn target award values.

In February 2019, the Compensation Committee evaluated the company's achievement against the above-described performance goals, and determined that Mr. Khani earned the following payout with respect to the 2017 and 2018 PSU tranche due to the "look-back" feature in our former parent's LTIC program:

2018 Change in Control and CEO Employment Agreements. In connection with a review of the plans and programs that we assumed from our former parent in connection with the separation, our Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, new severance and double trigger cash severance CIC agreements covering each of our NEOs (other than the CEO), as well as an employment agreement for our CEO and President, all of which became effective on February 15, 2018. These agreements generally supersede the terms and conditions that were established by the agreements in place during 2017. 
These agreements (including the employment agreement for our CEO) provide for non-CIC severance exclusively upon a termination of employment absent "cause." In the case of a CIC scenario, each NEO is only entitled to cash severance if, following, or in connection with, a CIC, the NEO's employment is terminated by CEIX absent "cause" or if the NEO resigns due to constructive termination within a specified period. The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that CEIX (a) offers a compensation package that is competitive with that offered by other companies with whom we compete for talent, (b) retains and relies upon the undivided focus of our senior executives immediately prior to, during and following a CIC, and (c) diminishes the inevitable distraction of our NEOs by virtue of personal uncertainties and risks created by the potential job loss following a CIC. 
In addition to the double trigger severance CIC provisions, all of the agreements (including the CEO's employment agreement) include post termination restrictive covenants relating to confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation and also require each NEO to sign an appropriate release of claims. The new agreements do not include any gross up feature arising from the excise tax payable on an excess parachute payment. 
The CEO's employment agreement also provides for a three-year initial term of employment automatically renewed for additional one-year periods unless either party provides advance written notice within sixty days of the end of the term. 
Retirement Benefit Plans in Effect During 2018. We maintain several retirement plans, the purpose of which is to attract and retain employees and to ensure an overall competitive compensation and benefits offering for all of our employees, including our NEOs. The maintenance of these plans also reflects commitments made at the time of our separation from our former parent that required us to assume certain plan liabilities as a result of the separation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Qualified Defined Contribution Plan. We maintain a qualified Investment Plan which operates as a 401(k)  savings plan for eligible employees of CEIX and its affiliates, including our NEOs. Plan participants may make before-tax and/or after-tax contributions of 1% to 75% of  eligible compensation to the plan via payroll deductions. Plan participants who have attained age 50 before the end of the plan year are eligible to make catch-up contributions. A participant may also  separately designate from 1% to 75% (not to exceed $10,000) of any incentive compensation payment as a before-tax and/or after-tax contribution. The company matches 100%  of a participant's contribution up to 6% of eligible compensation. The plan also permits certain discretionary contributions ranging from 1% to 6%.  
[END TABLE]
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee authorized a discretionary contribution to be allocated to participants (including our NEOs) in the amount of 6% of eligible plan compensation (subject to annual limits in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")). The contribution was made in light of CEIX's (and its affiliates') outstanding performance in achieving $248 million in actual free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders. The contribution is attributable to the plan's 2018 year. Consistent with historical practice, if the discretionary contribution made on behalf of any participant (including an NEO) exceeds the limits for the year, the contribution amount is paid in cash to the employee.     
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Compensation Discussion and Analysis
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Qualified Defined Benefit Plan. We also maintain an Employee Retirement Plan, a qualified  defined benefit plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, which was initially frozen in 2014 for certain plan participants and then subsequently frozen to all remaining plan participants as of December 31, 2015.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Qualified Retirement Restoration Plan (the "Restoration  Plan"). We assumed the obligations for certain participants under our former parent's Restoration Plan and adopted a new plan effective as of the separation under which we will meet our obligation to pay these restoration plan  benefits. This plan is an unfunded deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of employees whose eligible compensation under the Pension Plan (defined below) exceeded limits imposed by the federal income tax laws. This plan has been  frozen since December 31, 2006.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Qualified Supplemental Retirement Plan. We also  assumed the obligations for certain participants under our former parent's Supplemental Retirement Plan, and adopted a new plan effective as of the separation under which plan we will meet our obligation to pay these supplemental retirement  plan benefits. This plan was frozen effective as of December 31, 2011.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Restoration Plan (the "New  Restoration Plan"). We also assumed obligations for certain participants arising from our former parent's New Restoration Plan, which unlike the plans discussed above is not frozen and covers our current employees, including our  NEOs. Eligibility for benefits under this plan is determined each calendar year, and participants whose eligible plan compensation exceeds the compensation limits imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code (up to $275,000 for 2018) are eligible for  New Restoration Plan benefits. The amount of each participant's benefit under this plan is equal to 9% times his or her eligible plan compensation, less 6% times the lesser of his or her annual base salary as of December 31 or the  compensation limit imposed by the Code for such year ($275,000 for 2018). These benefits are described in the compensation tables following this CD&A beginning on page 34.  
[END TABLE]
Governance Policies 
Clawback Policy. We maintain a clawback policy in our Omnibus Plan that permits our Compensation Committee to recover any award (whether cash or equity based), which is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation, and stock exchange listing requirement or company policy. In addition, any awards made under our Omnibus Plan are subject to recoupment in the event an award recipient violates any restrictive covenant in his or her award agreement relating to confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation. During 2018, all CEIX incentive awards (whether cash or equity based) were made under the terms of the Omnibus Plan and thus subject to recovery under our policy. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines/Holding Requirements for NEOs. We adopted stock ownership guidelines applicable to each of our NEOs, which require that they own a minimum number of shares of CEIX stock, based upon a multiple of base salary. The guidelines provide each NEO with a five-year period from January 25, 2018 to achieve the applicable ownership level. The ownership requirements applicable to the NEOs are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer       Ownership Requirement (As Multiple of Base Salary)   
 Named Executive Officer       Ownership Requirement (As Multiple of Base Salary)

[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Compensation Committee Report benefit of the executive officer or his or her immediate family members residing in the same household; vested shares of restricted stock; and vested deferred stock units, restricted stock units or performance share units that may only be settled in shares. 
No Hedging/Pledging Policy. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit any executive officer (including an NEO) from entering into speculative transactions in CEIX securities, and similarly prohibit an executive officer from purchasing or selling puts, calls, options or other derivative securities based on CEIX securities. The policy also prohibits hedging or monetization transactions, such as forward sale contracts, in which the holder continues to own the underlying CEIX security without all the risks or rewards of ownership. 
Equity Grant Practices Policy. We maintain a written policy for granting equity awards, which describes the Compensation Committee's practices relating to equity grants to executives and the timing of such grants in relation to material and non-public information and which specifically prohibits the backdating of stock options. The policy also describes the Compensation Committee's delegation of authority to the Chair and Chief Executive Officer to award equity to non-executive employees. We do not have a practice or policy of timing our grants in relation to the announcement of material non-public information. In accordance with the policy, all stock option grants must have an exercise price equal to the closing price of CEIX common stock on the date of grant. 
Perquisites. We provide limited perquisites that we believe are reasonable, competitive and consistent with our compensation program, which are described more fully in the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table that appears on pages 34-35. 
Tax, Accounting and Regulatory Considerations. Our Compensation Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served if their discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards may result in non-deductible compensation expenses. However, our Compensation Committee does not anticipate a shift away from variable or performance-based compensation payable to our executive officers in the future, nor do we anticipate applying less rigor in the process by which we establish performance goals or evaluate performance against such pre-established goals, with respect to compensation paid to our NEOs. In addition, accounting considerations are one of many factors that our Compensation Committee considers in determining compensation mix and amount. 
Compensation Risk Assessment. Annually, our Compensation Committee reviews the compensation programs and practices of CEIX. The CEIX pay philosophy provides for an effective balance in cash and equity mix, short and long-term performance periods, and financial and non-financial performance goals, and affords the Compensation Committee discretion to adjust payouts under the company's compensation plans. Further, CEIX policies to mitigate compensation-related risk include stock ownership guidelines, vesting periods on equity, insider trading prohibitions, a clawback policy, caps on the amount of compensation that may be earned and independent Compensation Committee oversight. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that our plans and programs do not encourage unnecessary risk-taking and do not pose a material adverse effect on the company. The review was conducted by CEIX management with the assistance of the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Mercer.

(2)  The values in this column represent discretionary 2017 cash awards to all of the NEOs, except Mr. Brock, in  recognition of their significant contributions to the completion of the separation. No such discretionary awards were made during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The values set forth in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the service-based and  performance-based restricted stock unit awards made in 2018 computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value of the stock awards are set forth in Notes 1 and 17 to our consolidated  financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. For grants of restricted stock units, the fair value per share is equal to the closing price  of CEIX's common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant for awards made by CEIX. With respect to the 2018 grant of PSUs, the value is reported assuming the target level of performance is achieved. The value of the 2018 PSU awards to our NEOs,  assuming the maximum level of performance is achieved, are as follows: $4,877,829 (Brock); $5,540,376 (Khani); $1,072,000 (McCaffrey); $267,960 (Wiegand); and $267,960 (Salvatori).

(4)  The 2018 amounts shown in this column represent cash payments made to the NEOs under the 2018 STIC. See the discussion  beginning on page 25 in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section for additional information regarding the 2018 plan design, 2018 performance and payouts authorized under the 2018 STIC.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  Amounts in this column reflect the actuarial increase in the present value of each NEO's benefit under the  CEIX's Employee Retirement Plan, Retirement Restoration Plan, Supplemental Retirement Plan and New Restoration Plan between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. These amounts were determined using the interest rate and mortality  assumptions set forth in our consolidated financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts represent accounting values and were  not realized by our NEOs during 2018. A zero is shown for Messrs. Brock, McCaffrey and Salvatori for 2018 because the actual change in pension value was a decrease in the amount of $57,808 (Brock); $168,820 (McCaffrey); and $92,146 (Salvatori),  respectively. This decrease is attributable to changes in interest rates partially offset by an increase in the accrued benefit.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Tables 
Understanding our Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Tables 
In addition to base salaries, our executive officers receive a mix of at-risk compensation, both short- and long-term, for their services. Pursuant to various plans which were adopted by our former parent or CCR (and assumed by CEIX in connection with the separation), our NEOs are eligible to receive annual cash incentive awards based on the achievement of certain performance targets. With respect to long-term awards, each of our NEOs also is eligible to receive equity awards, which vary depending upon the year in which granted and include RSUs, PSUs (as well as historical grants made by our former parent and CCR) in the form of stock options and or phantom units. The RSUs and PSUs and the plans under which they are awarded are discussed below, and in greater detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on pages 27-28. 
STIC 
To be eligible to receive an annual award under the STIC, an NEO must generally be an active, full-time employee on December 31 of the year for which the award was granted. For more information on the STIC, see the discussion beginning on page 25 in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. 
RSUs 
RSUs granted by our former parent were converted into CEIX awards under our Omnibus Plan. Our Compensation Committee determines the number of RSUs to be granted to each executive participant, the duration of such awards, the conditions under which the RSUs may be forfeited to CEIX, and the other terms and conditions of such awards. RSUs are structured to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Accordingly, distributions will be made only upon a permissible distribution event, including upon separation from service. 
PSUs 
PSU awards were also granted and represent a contingent right to receive shares of CEIX common stock to the extent such units are earned and become payable pursuant to the terms of the plan and related award documents. For more information on the PSU awards, see the discussion beginning on page 27 in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. 
Options 
Option grants included in the Summary Compensation Table reflect historical grants made by our former parent and remain outstanding awards under former parent's equity plan. These awards generally vest ratably over a three-year period from the grant date with each option, once vested, representing the right to receive one share of stock upon exercise of the option. Our former parent's compensation committee determined the number of options to be granted to each executive participant, the terms of the option (generally 10 years), and the other terms and conditions of their option awards. 
Phantom Units 
A phantom unit is a notional unit that entitles the grantee to receive a common unit upon vesting of the phantom unit, typically tied to a vesting schedule based on years of service or time, equal to the fair market value of a common unit. The phantom units described in our compensation tables refer to awards made before 2018 and were granted under the 2015 CONSOL Coal Resources LP Long-term Incentive Plan during 2017.

Employee Retirement Plan (the "Pension Plan") 
CEIX assumed sponsorship of the CONSOL Energy Inc. Employee Retirement Plan (the "Pension Plan"), which was previously sponsored by our former parent and is a qualified defined benefit plan that pays retirement benefits based on years of service and compensation. The Pension Plan is a qualified plan, meaning that it is subject to a variety of Internal Revenue Service rules. Effective December 31, 2015, the Pension Plan was frozen and no employee, including any of our NEOs, is eligible for future accruals under the plan. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Pension Benefits Table
Eligibility. Historically, the Pension Plan covered employees of CEIX and affiliated participating companies that are classified as regular, full-time employees or that complete 1,000 hours of service during a specified twelve-month period. As mentioned above, the plan was frozen on December 31, 2015 for all participants as of December 31, 2015. As a result of these amendments, none of our NEOs have accrued any additional benefits under the Pension Plan after December 31, 2015. 
Incapacity Retirement. Employees who have attained age 40 with at least 10 years of service who are deemed disabled and consequently receive a Social Security disability award (proving the disability occurred while employed by CEIX or a participating affiliated company) are eligible for an incapacity retirement resulting in an unreduced benefit under the Pension Plan, payable in the form of an annuity, commencing the month following termination. Messrs. Brock, McCaffrey and Salvatori and Ms. Wiegand have satisfied the age and service conditions necessary to be eligible for incapacity retirement under the Pension Plan as of December 31, 2018, if any such person had incurred a qualifying disability as of that date. 
Separation Retirement. Employees who terminate employment with five or more years of service prior to attaining age 50, or who have attained age 50 but have fewer than 10 years of service upon termination, qualify for separation retirement. The accrued vested benefit is payable at a reduced amount for payments commencing prior to age 65, or the full benefit may be paid at age 65. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Khani and Salvatori and Ms. Wiegand are eligible for separation retirement under the Pension Plan; provided, however, that Ms. Wiegand and Mr. Salvatori would not be entitled to payment until each NEO attained age 50. 
Early Retirement. Employees who have completed 10 or more years of service and are age 50 or older upon termination are eligible for early retirement. Under early retirement, an employee may elect to defer payment to age 65 or elect to begin receiving payment the first of any month up to age 65, subject to a reduction for age. Payments commencing prior to age 65 are reduced based on various early reduction schedules depending upon age at the payment commencement date and years of service at the time of termination. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Brock and McCaffrey are eligible for early retirement under the Pension Plan. Ms. Wiegand and Mr. Salvatori will be eligible once they attain age 50. 
Normal Retirement. Employees who terminate employment and have attained age 65 qualify for normal retirement. Payment of the full benefit commences the month following termination. None of the NEOs qualify for normal retirement under the Pension Plan as of December 31, 2018, if they had terminated employment on that date. 
Form of Payment. The portion of accrued pension benefits earned under the Pension Plan as of December 31, 2005 may be, upon the election of the participant, paid in the form of a lump-sum payment except in the case of an incapacity retirement as discussed above. Pension benefits earned after January 1, 2006 are payable in the form of a single life annuity, 50% joint and survivor annuity, 75% joint and survivor annuity or 100% joint and survivor annuity. 
Calculation of Benefits. Pension benefits, which are now frozen, are based on an employee's years of service and average monthly pay during the employee's five highest-paid years while eligible for service under the Pension Plan. Average monthly pay for this purpose excludes compensation in excess of limits imposed by the Code. Since the Pension Plan is frozen, average monthly pay is based on pay as of December 31, 2014 for Mr. Khani and Ms. Wiegand, and as of December 31, 2015 for Messrs. Brock, McCaffrey and Salvatori. Prior to January 1, 2006, pension benefits were calculated based on the average monthly pay during the employee's three highest-paid years and included annual amounts payable under CEIX's STIC, again excluding compensation in excess of limits imposed by the Code. 
Retirement Restoration Plan (the "Restoration Plan") 
CEIX assumed the obligations for certain participants under our former parent's Restoration Plan and adopted a new plan effective as of the separation under which it will meet its obligation to pay these restoration plan benefits. This plan is an unfunded deferred compensation plan maintained by the company for the benefit of employees whose eligible compensation under the Pension Plan exceeded limits imposed by the federal income tax laws. This plan has been frozen since December 31, 2006. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control Tables 
Supplemental Retirement Plan 
CEIX also assumed the obligations for certain participants from our former parent's Supplemental Retirement Plan, and adopted a new plan effective as of the separation under which it will meet its obligation to pay these supplemental retirement plan benefits. This plan has been frozen since December 31, 2011. 
New Restoration Plan 
CEIX also assumed obligations for certain participants arising from our former parent's New Restoration Plan, which, unlike the plans discussed above, is not frozen and covers current CEIX employees, including our NEOs. Eligibility for benefits under this plan is determined each calendar year, and participants whose eligible plan compensation exceeds the compensation limits imposed by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code (up to $275,000 for 2018) are eligible for New Restoration Plan benefits. The amount of each participant's benefit under this plan is equal to 9% times his or her eligible plan compensation, less 6% times the lesser of his or her annual base salary as of December 31 or the compensation limit imposed by the Code for such year ($275,000 for 2018). 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control Tables 
Except as otherwise provided, the following narrative and tables set forth the potential payments and the value of other benefits that would vest or otherwise accelerate vesting at, following, or in connection with any termination, including, without limitation, resignation, an incapacity retirement or an involuntary termination absent cause of one of our NEOs, or a CIC of CEIX as defined by applicable plans and agreements. 
For each currently employed NEO, the payments and benefits detailed in the tables below are in addition to any payments under our plans and arrangements that are offered or provided generally to all salaried employees on a non-discriminatory basis. The tables also assume that employment termination and/or a CIC occurred on December 31, 2018 and are based only on agreements in place as of December 31, 2018. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control Tables 
A description of the key elements of the plans, arrangements and agreements covered by the following tables and which provide for payments or benefits in connection with a termination of employment or CIC are described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on page 31 and further explained in the section following these tables entitled "Understanding our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information." The footnotes to the tables also describe the assumptions that were used in calculating the amounts described below.

(1)  In the event of a qualifying termination in connection with a CIC, each of our NEOs would be entitled to a lump sum  cash payment equal to a multiple of base salary plus a multiple of incentive pay (the multiple for Mr. Brock is 3.0, for Mr. Khani is 2.5, for Mr. McCaffrey is 2.0, for Ms. Wiegand is 2.0, and for Mr. Salvatori is 2.0). The  narrative following these tables contains a description of events that constitute a CIC.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  In the event of death, each NEO would earn a pro rata portion of his or her short-term incentive award. In the event of  a qualifying termination in connection with a CIC, each NEO would also be entitled to a pro-rated payment of his or her short-term incentive compensation based upon the length of service during the year in  which the termination occurred under the terms of their CIC agreements. Assuming a target payout for 2018 and a CIC at year-end on December 31, 2018, each of these NEOs would receive, in addition to the  amount shown in the table, the amounts set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table under the target amounts for non-equity incentive plan awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Under the CIC and severance agreements adopted in 2018, each NEO is entitled to a cash lump sum benefit equal to a  multiple of his or her base salary, but only in the event the executive is involuntarily terminated by the company absent cause (the multiple for Mr. Brock is 2.0 and for all of the other NEOs the multiple is 1.0).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Under the terms of the CIC and severance agreements covering our NEOs, all of their outstanding equity awards would  vest in the event of a CIC resulting in the NEO's termination of employment. The accelerated awards shown in this section for Messrs. Brock, McCaffrey and Salvatori and Ms. Wiegand relate only to the RSU awards granted on December 12,  2017 and February 6, 2018. For Mr. Khani, the accelerated awards shown in this section relate to RSU awards granted on January 31, 2014, January 31, 2017, December 12, 2017 and February 6, 2018. Awards shown in this  section are valued based on the company's closing stock price of $31.71 on December 31, 2018.

(10)  This calculation is an estimate for proxy disclosure purposes only. Note that actual payments for Messrs. Brock and  Salvatori would be reduced pursuant to the terms of their respective CIC agreements by the amounts shown in the above tables under "280G Tax Reduction." Payments made in connection with an actual CIC may differ based on factors such as  transaction price, timing of employment termination and payments, methodology for valuing equity awards, changes in compensation, reasonable compensation analyses and the value of any covenant not to compete and also including assumed federal and  applicable tax rates for each NEO.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information 
Understanding Our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information 
This section provides certain information regarding some of our agreements, plans and programs, which provide for benefits to be paid to our NEOs in connection with employment termination and/or a CIC of the company with respect to each of our NEOs. 
RSUs 
Awards granted before separation. All shares subject to RSU awards issued under the Omnibus Plan that were originally granted by our former parent in 2016 and 2017 will vest in full upon a termination of employment other than for "cause" (as defined in our plan) related to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incapacity Retirement under the CEIX Pension Plan; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Death.  
[END TABLE]
Also, if an NEO's employment is terminated for "cause" or if the NEO breaches the non-competition or proprietary information covenants, then, in addition to awards being cancelled with respect to any unvested shares, the NEO will also forfeit all of his or her right, title and interest in and to any shares which have vested under existing awards and which are held by him or her at that time or are otherwise subject to deferred issuance. To the extent an NEO has sold any of his or her vested shares within the six-month period ending with the date of the NEO's termination for "cause" or breach of the non-competition or proprietary information covenants or at any time thereafter, then the NEO will be required to repay to CEIX, within 10 days after receipt of written demand from CEIX, the cash proceeds received upon each such sale, provided the demand is made by CEIX within one year after the date of that sale. In the event employment is terminated because of a reduction in force, the NEO will not be subject to the non-competition and certain non-solicitation provisions contained in the award agreement. 
RSU awards originally granted by our former parent, whether or not vested, vest upon a change in control (CIC) as defined in the Omnibus Plan, unless otherwise provided for in an award agreement. This is in contrast to RSUs granted post-separation by CEIX, which include double trigger vesting provisions described immediately below. 
Awards granted on December 12, 2017 or February 6, 2018. For RSU awards issued by CEIX after our separation from our former parent, such awards vest on a pro rata basis only in the event of a termination of employment other than for "cause" as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incapacity Retirement under the CEIX Pension Plan (or "Disability" as defined by the Omnibus Plan for RSUs  granted in 2018);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Death;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Involuntary termination of NEO's employment by CEIX absent "cause" (as defined by the Omnibus Plan); or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attainment of age 50 (age 55 for 2018 grants).  
[END TABLE]
In these circumstances, the NEO is entitled to retain a prorated portion of the RSUs based on the ratio of the number of completed months that the NEO worked during the vesting period. Any remaining portion of the award is forfeited. Similar to the pre-separation RSUs, if an NEO is terminated for "cause" or breaches the restrictive covenants relating to confidentiality, non-competition or non-solicitation, all unvested shares covered by the award are immediately forfeited and any vested shares are subject to recoupment by CEIX within one year after CEIX's discovery of the NEO's breach of any covenant. 
Full vesting of RSU awards will occur in a CIC scenario as described below. If an acquirer assumes the RSU awards, and within two years following the CIC, the NEO terminates employment by reason of death, Disability, after reaching age 50, or if the assuming company terminates the NEO's employment without cause, the RSUs will vest in full. In the event of a CIC where the RSUs are not assumed, the RSUs will immediately vest and be settled as soon as practicable. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information 
PSUs 
All PSUs granted before separation. Any PSU award shown in the table that was initially issued by our former parent will vest either in full or on a pro rata basis (as noted below) upon a termination of employment other than for "cause" (as defined in our plan) related to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attainment of age 62 (pro rata vesting only);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Death (full vesting);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Disability (pro rata vesting only); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Qualifying Separation (full vesting).  
[END TABLE]
In all cases, the NEO will be entitled to retain the PSUs and receive payment therefor, only to the extent the PSUs are earned and payable, as approved by the Compensation Committee after evaluating the company's actual performance against the performance goals attached to such awards at the end of the performance period. In the case of a termination on or after the NEO attaining the age of 62 or on account of Disability, the NEO's prorated award will be based on the ratio of the number of completed months that the NEO worked in the performance period. 
With respect to outstanding PSUs granted prior to 2017, the termination provisions generally are the same, except that (i) there will be no Qualifying Separation and (ii) if an NEO's employment terminates by reason of a reduction in force as specified and implemented by CEIX prior to any payment date, the NEO will be entitled to retain the PSUs and receive payment, to the extent earned and payable. 
PSU awards, whether or not vested, vest upon a change in control (CIC) as defined in the Omnibus Plan, unless otherwise provided for in an award agreement. However, with respect to outstanding PSU awards, upon a CIC, the applicable performance goals will be deemed to have been achieved on such date and the PSUs will be paid based on performance relative to such goals as of such date, with the value of such PSUs to be settled on the closing date of the CIC transaction; provided, however, that in the event of a CIC, PSUs may be settled in cash and/or securities or other property. 
PSUs granted by CEIX in 2018. PSUs granted in 2018 after our separation from our former parent will vest on a pro rata basis upon a termination of employment other than for "cause" (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) related to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attainment of age 55;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Death;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Disability (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) or;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in Control (as defined in the Omnibus Plan).  
[END TABLE]
In all cases (other than a CIC), the NEO will be entitled to retain the PSUs and receive payment therefor, only to the extent that the PSUs are earned and payable, as approved by the Compensation Committee after evaluating the company's actual performance against the performance goals attached to such awards at the end of the performance period. The pro rata portion of the PSUs that vest will be determined by multiplying the number of PSUs earned based on the ratio of the number of completed months that the NEO worked in the performance period against the number of months in the full performance period. 
In the event of a CIC, the PSUs will vest on a pro rata basis (as described above) and be deemed earned in an amount equal to the greater of (x) the target performance level, or (y) the level of achievement of the performance goals for the PSUs as determined by the Compensation Committee through the date of the CIC, if determinable. 
Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan Definitions 
The following definitions and provisions are set forth in our Omnibus Plan: 
"Cause" is defined, unless otherwise defined in the applicable award agreement, as a determination by the Compensation Committee that a person has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty or breach of 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information fiduciary duty to CEIX, deliberately and repeatedly violated the rules of CEIX or the valid instructions of the Board or an authorized officer of CEIX, made any unauthorized disclosure of any previously undisclosed material secrets or confidential information of CEIX, or engaged in any conduct that could reasonably be expected to result in material loss, damage or injury to CEIX. 
"Change in control" means (unless otherwise provided for in an equity award agreement) the earliest to occur of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any one person (other than the company, trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of  the company and any company owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of company stock), or more than one person acting as a group, is or becomes the "beneficial  owner" of shares that, together with the shares held by that person or group, possess more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the company's shares;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority of members of the Board is replaced during any 12-month period by  directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or election; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the sale of all or substantially all of the company's assets; provided, however, that in addition to the foregoing,  such event must also qualify as a CIC event within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i) with respect to the company.  
[END TABLE]
"Disability" is defined, unless otherwise defined in the applicable award agreement, as an award recipient's inability, because of physical or mental incapacity or injury (that has continued for a period of at least 12-consecutive calendar months), to perform for CEIX or an affiliate of CEIX substantially the same services as he or she performed prior to incurring the incapacity or injury. 
Supplemental Retirement Plan 
If a participant's employment with CEIX or any subsidiary terminates for cause (which is defined in the Supplemental Retirement Plan to include a violation of any non-solicitation, non-competition or non-disclosure provision contained in any agreement entered into by and between a participant and CEIX or any subsidiary), no benefits will be payable under the Supplemental Retirement Plan. Additionally, each participant agrees by participating in the Supplemental Retirement Plan that within 10 days after the date we provide the participant with a notice that there has occurred a termination on account of "cause," the participant will pay to us in cash an amount equal to any and all distributions paid to or on behalf of such participant under the plan within the six months prior to the date of the earliest breach. A forfeiture of Supplemental Retirement Plan benefits will also occur for certain "cause" events even if the event does not occur or is not discovered until after any termination of employment. Benefits under the Supplemental Retirement Plan will immediately vest upon death or disability of a participant or upon a CIC (as described below). 
Further, the participant will be entitled to receive the vested benefits in a lump sum payment if the participant's employment is terminated after, or in connection with, a change of control (as defined in the Supplemental Retirement Plan) on account of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an involuntary termination associated with a CIC within the two year period after the CIC, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a termination by CEIX other than for cause or due to the participant's death or disability that (A) occurs not  more than three months prior to the date on which a CIC occurs or (B) is required by a third party who initiates a CIC.  
[END TABLE]
The benefit will be calculated as if the participant terminated on the date of the CIC, but the participant will be considered only for purposes of applying the appropriate actuarial reduction to have a minimum age of 55 and a minimum of 20 years of credited service. Additional service credit will also be provided for the term of any payments under a participant's CIC Agreement, if any, with CEIX. See "Understanding our Pension Benefits Table" beginning on page 39 for more information regarding the Supplemental Retirement Plan. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information 
New Restoration Plan 
In the event a participant in the New Restoration Plan terminates employment with CEIX and its subsidiaries in connection with a change in control (CIC) (as defined in the New Restoration Plan), the participant is entitled to a contribution to the New Restoration Plan for the year in which the termination occurs. If such termination occurs prior to September 30 of a calendar year, then such contribution will be based upon the participant's base salary and target bonus for the year and, if such termination occurs on or after September 30 of a calendar year, such contribution will be based upon the participant's base salary and actual bonus for the year. Notably, the same contribution treatment applies for participants who incur an involuntary termination of employment due to death, disability, incapacity retirement or reduction in force, and the same compensation treatment for terminations that occur on or after September 30 applies to participants who voluntarily resign from employment. If a participant's employment terminates on account of "cause" (as defined in the New Restoration Plan), no benefits will be payable under the plan. Additionally, each participant agrees by participating in the New Restoration Plan that within 10 days after the date we provide the participant with a notice that there has occurred a termination on account of "cause," the participant will pay to us in cash an amount equal to any and all distributions paid to or on behalf of such participant under the plan within the six months prior to the date of the earliest breach. A forfeiture of New Restoration Plan benefits will also occur for certain "cause" events even if the event does not occur or is not discovered until after any termination of employment. 
Agreements in Place During 2018 (Change in Control and Non-CIC Severance) 
As of December 31, 2018, all of our NEOs were covered by an agreement providing for CIC protection. 
2018 Change in Control Agreements for Messrs. Khani, McCaffrey and Salvatori and Ms. Wiegandand Employment Agreement for Mr. Brock. During 2018, CEIX entered into severance and CIC agreements with all of our NEOs. In addition, CEIX entered into an individual employment agreement with our CEO and President that includes CIC severance protection. Generally, these agreements supersede the terms and conditions that were established by CIC agreements in place before 2018. 
The agreements for the NEOs (including the CEO employment agreement) provide for both (i) non-CIC cash severance and (ii) CIC cash severance exclusively upon a termination of employment absent "cause," subject to the following requirements. In the case of a "CIC scenario," the agreement is "double trigger" and each executive is only entitled to cash severance if, following, or in connection with, a CIC, the executive's employment is terminated by CEIX absent "cause" or if the executive resigns due to constructive or good reason termination within 90 days prior to the CIC or within two years following the CIC. These agreements (including the CEO employment agreement) do not include any gross up feature arising from the excise tax payable on an excess parachute payment. 
Under these agreements, each NEO would be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum cash payment equal to a multiple of base salary (2x for Mr. Brock; 1x for Mr. Khani; 1x for  Mr. McCaffrey; 1x for Ms. Wiegand; and 1x for Mr. Salvatori) in a non-CIC involuntary termination of employment absent "cause";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum cash payment equal to a multiple of base salary plus a multiple of annual incentive pay in an involuntary  termination of employment or constructive (or good reason) termination related to a CIC absent "cause" (3x for Mr. Brock; 2.5x for Mr. Khani; 2x for Mr. McCaffrey; 2x for Ms. Wiegand; and 2x for Mr. Salvatori);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a prorated payment of the executive's annual incentive compensation for the year in which the termination occurs in  both a CIC and non-CIC termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated vesting of any outstanding long-term incentive compensation upon the second trigger related to a CIC  termination event; provided, however, that any outstanding performance-based awards will be settled at the greater of target or actual performance (if ascertainable at the CIC) and prorated for service to the date of the CIC;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued healthcare for 18 months for both a CIC and non CIC termination absent "cause";   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• outplacement assistance in the form of a cash payment equal to $25,000 in a CIC termination only;  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Change in Control and Employment Termination Tables and Information 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment equal to the total amount the executive would have received under the CONSOL Energy 401(k) plan assuming  he or she continued employment for a period of eighteen (18) months in a CIC termination only; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pension enhancement in the form a cash payment equivalent to the difference between the present value of the  executive's accrued benefit at his or her actual termination date under CEIX's qualified defined benefit plan and (if eligible) any plans sponsored by the Company or any of its affiliates providing  non-qualified retirement benefits, the present value of the accrued benefit the executive would have received assuming he or she continued employment for 18 months in a CIC termination only.   
[END TABLE]
The agreements also contain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation obligations for each of our NEOs (including the employment agreement for Mr. Brock) pursuant to which NEOs have agreed not to compete with the business for two years, or to solicit customers or employees for one year following a termination of employment. 
No payment or benefits are provided under any of these agreements (including the CEO's employment agreement) unless the NEO executes, and does not revoke, a written release of any and all claims (other than entitlements under the terms of the agreements or which may not be released under applicable law). 
For purposes of these agreements, the following definitions apply: 
"Cause" is defined as a determination by a majority of the board of directors of CEIX that the executive has 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  engaged in gross negligence in the performance of his or her duties;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  been convicted or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or any misdemeanor involving fraud, theft or  embezzlement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  failed or refused to perform his or her duties and responsibilities with the company (with an opportunity to cure);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (d)  breached a material restrictive covenant relating to non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (e)  willfully violated any material provision of the company's code of conduct; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (f)  willfully engaged in conduct demonstrably and materially injurious to the company.  
[END TABLE]
"Change in control" generally means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  an individual, entity or group acquires beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the total fair market value of the  common stock of the company or combined voting power of the company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  the board composition is modified so less than a majority of the board pre-CIC  remains in control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  the consummation of or reorganization, merger or consolidation of the company or other business combination involving  the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (d)  a complete liquidation of the company.  
[END TABLE]
"Constructive" or "good reason" termination" means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  a material adverse change in position or material diminution in duties and responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  a material reduction in base salary (excluding generally a reduction applicable to all executive officers); or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  the relocation of the executive's principal work location that increases his or her commute by 50 or more miles.   
[END TABLE]
The individual employment agreement between Mr. Brock and CEIX provides for a three-year initial term of employment automatically renewed for additional one-year periods unless either party provides advance written notice within 60 days of the end of the term. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Human Capital Management 
Human Capital Management 
We invest in our human capital by providing a wide range of benefits and programs that speak to our commitment to help our employees better manage their physical and financial health, as well as their work/life balance and professional development. Our annual incentive program is designed to reward all Company employees (including our senior management team) for their commitment to our values with respect to a variety of performance factors including safety, sustainability and environmental compliance. We offer a 401(k) plan that matches employee contributions, and permits a discretionary profit sharing contribution in years where the Company exhibits extraordinary performance. We also offer competitive group health benefits, prescription drug, dental and vision coverage, short and long-term disability, a Health Savings Account (HSA), group accident, critical illness, and identity theft coverage. In an effort to encourage employees to invest in their own well-being, we also offer a voluntary wellness program. Finally, we provide opportunities for professional growth and development, and offer affordable benefits and programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees and their families. 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, we determined the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Brock, our President and Chief Executive Officer, relative to the annual total compensation of our median employee. 
We identified our median employee by using 2018 W-2 wages for U.S. individuals who were employed by CEIX and its affiliates on December 21, 2018, which included all of the company's 1,774 employees. 
We then determined total compensation for the median employee in the same manner as the "Total Compensation" column shown for Mr. Brock in the Summary Compensation Table on page 34. 
Pay elements that were included to determine total annual compensation for the median employee were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary, including overtime, vacation and holiday pay;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash incentive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 401(k) matching contribution; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 401(k) discretionary contribution.  
[END TABLE]
We determined that the 2018 annual total compensation of our median employee was $123,470 and Mr. Brock's 2018 annual total compensation was $4,556,078. The ratio of Mr. Brock's total annual compensation to the median employee's total annual compensation is 36.9 –to-1. The pay ratio determination is made solely with respect to "Total Compensation" without regard to hours worked or employee duties or responsibilities. 
We believe this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the pay ratio SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above.

Board of Directors and Its Committees 
Board of Directors 
The business and affairs of CEIX are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board currently consists of six directors, who are divided into three classes with staggered terms. Under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Class II directors to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will serve three-year terms expiring in 2022. Beginning with the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors to be elected at each annual meeting will be elected to serve one-year terms, such that by 2023, all directors will be subject to re-election annually, and the Board will no longer be classified. 
We do not have a formal policy regarding directors' attendance at our annual meetings of stockholders; however, all directors are encouraged to attend. All of CEIX's directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and all of the directors are expected to attend this year's Annual Meeting. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board currently is structured with separate Chair and Chief Executive Officer positions. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board will determine whether to have a joint Chair and Chief Executive Officer or separate these offices as part of the succession planning process when it elects a Chief Executive Officer or at other appropriate times. The Board believes that the most effective leadership structure for our company at this time is to have Mr. Powell serve as independent Chair and Mr. Brock to serve as Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes these separate positions can facilitate Mr. Brock's focus on the operation of our company and implementation of our strategy and business plans, while ensuring effective oversight and focus by the Board on accountability of management, oversight and corporate governance matters. 
The Board believes there is no single best leadership structure that is the most effective in all circumstances and may decide to combine the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer in the future, if it deems appropriate and in the best interests of our company and stockholders. In such case, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board will designate an independent member of the Board to serve as Lead Director, with duties and responsibilities including acting as liaison between the Chair and the independent directors, presiding at meetings in the absence of the Chair, including executive sessions, reviewing and approving with the Chair meeting schedules and agendas and information necessary for each meeting, having authority to direct the Chief Executive Officer or Corporate Secretary to call a special meeting of the independent directors, and consulting directly with major stockholders as appropriate. 
Determination of Director Independence 
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards require a majority of our directors and each member of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees to be independent. In February 2019, our Board evaluated the relevant relationships between each director or director nominee (and his or her immediate family members and affiliates) and CEIX, and affirmatively determined that each of our directors, other than Mr. Brock (who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of CEIX), had no material relationship with CEIX and is "independent" under the corporate governance rules of the NYSE codified in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Effective March 1, 2019, Sophie Bergeron, who is independent under the NYSE listing standards, replaced retiring independent director Alvin R. Carpenter on the Board. In February 2019, the Board also determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence standards required for audit committee members under the NYSE listing standards and the SEC rules, and considered the additional factors under the NYSE rules relating to members of the Compensation Committee before determining that each of them is independent.

Board Skills and Experience 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to cultivate a Board with the appropriate skill sets and diversity of experiences to discharge its responsibilities effectively. Each director possesses a unique background and, in the aggregate, we believe the Board encompasses the skills and experiences deemed important to effectively oversee our business. 
This table below summarizes some of the key skills and experiences that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently believes should be represented on the Board, as well as the number of directors who possess each skill.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Board of Directors and Its Committees
Our Compensation Committee's charter generally permits it to delegate its authority, duties and responsibilities or functions to one or more members of the Compensation Committee or to CEIX's officers, except where otherwise prohibited by law or applicable listing standards. The terms of our Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan") also permit our Compensation Committee to delegate any power and authority granted to it by the Board under the Omnibus Plan to our officers. 
Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews the compensation paid to our non-employee directors and the principles upon which their compensation is determined. The Compensation Committee also periodically reports to the Board on how our non-employee director compensation practices compare with those of other similarly situated public corporations and, if the Compensation Committee deems it appropriate, recommends changes to our director compensation practices to our Board for approval.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify director candidates with leadership experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility. Director nominees are expected to be selected based upon contributions that they can make to CEIX. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Board of Directors and Its Committees
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders, although a formal policy has not been adopted with respect to consideration of such candidates because stockholder recommendations may be submitted and considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee under its charter. Director candidates recommended by stockholders will be evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee using the same criteria as candidates identified by the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration. Stockholders may submit names of director candidates to Secretary, CONSOL Energy Inc., 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, and should follow the procedure set forth in the Company's bylaws. See "Additional Matters" on page 65 for more information on making director nominations. 
Board Diversity and Inclusion. The Board has adopted a policy regarding the diversity of its members, which is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. CEIX believes in diversity and values the benefits diversity can bring to its Board and to the Company. For the purposes of Board composition, diversity includes, but is not limited to, business experience, geography, age, gender and ethnicity. Board diversity promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, and ensures that the company has the opportunity to benefit from all available talent. The promotion of a diverse Board makes prudent business sense and makes for better corporate governance. 
CEIX seeks to maintain a Board comprised of talented and dedicated directors with a diverse mix of expertise, experience, skills and background. The skills and backgrounded collectively represented on the Board should reflect the diverse nature of the business environment in which CEIX operates. CEIX will periodically assess the composition of the Board in light of the needs of the Board at the time, including the extent to which the current composition of the Board reflects a diverse mix knowledge, experience, skills and backgrounds. 
CEIX is committed to a Board composition within a diverse and inclusive culture, which solicits multiple perspectives and views and is free of conscious or unconscious bias and discrimination. 
Process for Board Assessment and Future Candidates. Set forth below is a summary of the process the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board intend to use in reviewing Board needs and future candidates.

Understanding Our Director Compensation Table 
Each non-employee director is entitled to receive an annual equity award in the form of RSUs valued at $150,000 (other than the Board Chair whose RSUs are valued at $300,000) as of the close of business on the date of grant, which in 2018 was May 9, 2018. The RSU awards vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Each non-employee director is also entitled to receive a cash Board Retainer, and if he or she serves as a Committee Chair, an Audit Committee member or the Board Chair, an additional cash retainer for his or her services as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Element of Compensation   Dollar Value of Board Compensation 
 Element of Compensation   Dollar Value of Board Compensation 
 Chair Retainer    $  200,000  (1)

[END TABLE]
During 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board reviewed with its independent compensation consultant the current director compensation program and concluded that (1) the mix of cash and equity compensation continues to be appropriate and consistent with broadly observed market practices, (2) the compensation levels are reasonable and in line with peer practices given the small size of the Board, and (3) the aggregate board compensation (reflecting the "total cost of governance") is reasonably positioned as compared to the Company's peer group members. Except as disclosed immediately below under "Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors", the basic non-employee director compensation elements remain unchanged from 2017. 
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors 
In September 2018, our Board approved a Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan, which authorizes our non-employee directors to defer all or a portion of their annual cash and/or stock compensation, effective with respect to deferrals of compensation for the 2019 calendar year. Participation in the plan is voluntary and at the election of each individual director. Amounts deferred under the plan (whether cash or equity–based) are payable in the form of deferred stock units and generally settled within thirty days of the director's termination of service, but in no event later than the fifth anniversary of such termination date. The plan is an unfunded and unsecured liability of CEIX and any benefits paid to our non-employee directors will be paid from CEIX's general assets. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION INFORMATION | Understanding Our Director Compensation Table
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines to align the interest of our non-employee directors with those of our stockholders. The guidelines require that our non-employee directors hold CEIX common stock with a value equal to five times their annual Board cash retainer on or before the fifth anniversary of becoming a Board member. Shares counted towards the guidelines include: shares owned outright by the director or his or her immediate family members residing in the same household; shares held in trust for the benefit of the director or his or her immediate family members residing in the same household; vested shares of restricted stock; and vested deferred stock units, restricted stock units or performance share units that may only be settled in shares.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires CEIX's directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of CEIX's common stock to file with the SEC and deliver to CEIX initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of such registered equity securities. To our knowledge, based solely upon a review of Section 16 filings with the SEC, written representations that no other reports were required, and on CEIX's records, we believe that during 2018, CEIX's executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.

Our Board adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures providing for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions with directors, nominees for director and executive officers and certain of their family members (the "related persons"). A copy of the policy is available on our website at www.consolenergy.com. 
Under the policy, prior to entering into a potential related person transaction (which generally is a transaction in excess of $120,000 involving CEIX and a related person), the director, director nominee or executive officer must notify our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel of the material facts regarding the transaction. If our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel determine that the proposed transaction is in fact a related person transaction, the details of the transaction are presented to our Audit Committee (or if it is not practicable or desirable to wait until the next Audit Committee meeting, to the Chair of the Audit Committee) for approval. The Audit Committee or its Chair, as applicable, will consider all relevant facts and circumstances available, including the terms of the transaction and terms that would be available to unrelated parties, the benefits to the company, and, if the transaction involves an independent director, any impact the transaction would have on such director's independence. The Audit Committee or its Chair, as applicable, will also inform our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of any related person transactions involving directors or nominees. Since the SEC's related person rules also apply to directors' and executive officers' family members, as well as entities in which they may be deemed to have an indirect material interest, it is possible that related person transactions could occur without a director or executive officer being aware of them and seeking approval in accordance with the policy. When we become aware of a related person transaction that has not been previously approved, the policy provides that the details of the transaction will be presented to our Audit Committee or its Chair, as applicable, for ratification or other action. Our Audit Committee also reviews, on an annual basis, ongoing related person transactions having a remaining term of more than six months or that are in excess of $120,000. We also require that officers and directors complete annual director and officer questionnaires and adhere to written codes of business conduct and ethics regarding various topics, including conflicts of interest, the receipt of gifts, service in outside organizations, political activity and corporate opportunities. Officers and directors must certify compliance with these codes in writing each year. 
No reportable transactions existed during 2018, and there are currently no such proposed transactions, except as described below. 
Relationship with CONSOL Coal Resources LP (CCR) 
We are the sponsor of CONSOL Coal Resources LP (NYSE: CCR) and as of January 2019, we owned approximately 61% of the limited partnership interests in CCR and a 1.7% general partner interest in CCR through our wholly owned indirect subsidiary CONSOL Coal Resources GP, LLC (the "General Partner"). 
The General Partner manages CCR's operations and activities through its officers and directors. Messrs. Brock, Khani and Rothka and Ms. Wiegand serve as executive officers of both CEIX and the General Partner. In addition, Messrs. Brock, Khani and Salvatori, and Ms. Lackovic (an employee of CEIX), serve as directors of the General Partner. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Partnership Agreement and Distributions. Our relationship with CCR is governed under the terms of  CCR's Third Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. Under the terms of the partnership agreement, CCR makes quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders, including us as the holder of approximately 61% of the limited partnership units  and 1.7% of the general partnership units (as of January 2019). If distributions exceed the minimum quarterly distribution and other higher target distribution levels, CEIX is entitled to increasing percentages of the distributions, up to 48% of the  distributions above the highest target distribution level. During 2018, CCR distributed approximately $34.1 million with respect to the limited partnership interests that we hold and approximately $1.0 million with respect to the general  partner interest (including incentive distribution rights). Assuming CCR generates sufficient distributable cash flow to support the payment of the full minimum quarterly distribution on all of its outstanding units for four quarters, the General  Partner would receive an annual

     distribution of approximately $1.0 million on the 1.7% general partner interest, and we would receive an annual distribution of approximately $34.4 million on our common units and  subordinated units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Omnibus Agreement. CCR, the General Partner, CEIX and certain of CEIX's subsidiaries are party to a  First Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, as amended, that address the following matters: (1) CCR's payment to CEIX of an annual administrative support fee for the provision of certain administrative support services by CEIX and its  affiliates; (2) CCR's payment of an annual executive support fee the provision of certain executive support services by CEIX and its affiliates; (3) CCR's obligation to reimburse CEIX for the provision of certain management,  operating, and investor relation services by it and its affiliates; (4) CCR's obligation to reimburse CEIX for all other direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by us in providing general and administrative services (which  reimbursement is in addition to certain expenses of the General Partner and its affiliates that are reimbursed under the partnership agreement); and (5) certain indemnities from CEIX and CCR. In 2018, the total amount of fees and reimbursed  expenses paid by CCR to CEIX under this agreement was approximately $11.2 million. So long as CEIX controls the General Partner, the omnibus agreement will remain in full force and effect. If CEIX ceases to control the General Partner, the  omnibus agreement may be terminated, provided that the indemnification obligations will survive any such termination in accordance with their terms.  
[END TABLE]

Stockholder Proposals for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement or Presentation at Next Year's Annual Meeting 
Any proposal submitted by a stockholder for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for the 2020 annual meeting must (a) conform to the requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) be received by the Secretary of CEIX at our principal executive office no later than November 28, 2019. Any such proposal should be addressed to Secretary, CONSOL Energy Inc., 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317. Please see additional information below regarding the content of proposals. 
CEIX's bylaws require that all stockholder matters to be submitted for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting, but not included in CEIX's proxy statement, including any stockholder proposal not submitted under Rule 14a-8 or any director nomination, be received by the Secretary of CEIX by written notice no later than the close of business on February 8, 2020, and no earlier than the close of business on January 9, 2020, together with certain information specified in the bylaws. 
If the date of the 2020 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made by CEIX. 
General Information Regarding the Requirements for Stockholder Nominations of Directors 
Any stockholder desiring to nominate an individual for election as a director of CEIX must follow the process described above and submit to the Secretary the information required by Sections 2.9 and 2.10 of the bylaws (a copy of which will be provided to any stockholder upon written request to the Secretary), including, but not limited to, (i) the proposing person's notice, (ii) the nominee's written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualifications of such nominee and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf, directly or indirectly, the nomination is being made, and (iii) a written representation and agreement of the nominee in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request. 
In addition, CEIX may require the stockholder to provide such further information as it may reasonably request. 
Householding of Proxy Materials 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address and the same last name by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. CEIX and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single copy of the Internet Notice (or proxy statement and annual report) to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once stockholders have received notice from their broker or CEIX that materials will be sent in the householding manner to the stockholder's address, householding will continue until otherwise notified or until the stockholder revokes such consent. If, at any time, stockholders no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, they should notify their broker if shares are held in a brokerage account or CEIX if holding registered shares. CEIX will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Internet Notice (or annual report or proxy statement), as applicable, to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. To request householding, stockholders should notify their broker or CEIX. Requests to CEIX should be addressed to the Investor Relations department of CONSOL Energy Inc., 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, or may be made by calling CEIX at (724) 416-8300:

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
Our management team uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability, and include financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The metrics include: (i) coal production, sales volumes and average revenue per ton; (ii) cost of coal sold, a non-GAAP financial measure; (iii) cash cost of coal sold, a non-GAAP financial measure; (iv) average cash margin per ton sold, an operating ratio derived from non-GAAP financial measures, and (v) average operating margin per ton sold, an operating ratio derived from non-GAAP financial measures. 
Cost of coal sold, cash cost of coal sold, average cash margin per ton sold, and average operating margin per ton sold normalize the volatility contained within comparable GAAP measures by adjusting certain non-operating or non-cash transactions. Each of these non-GAAP metrics are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry, without  regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment  opportunities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment  opportunities.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, management believes that the non-GAAP measures of free cash flow and free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders are meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand CEIX's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure. 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to total costs, net income, operating cash flow, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures and the way we calculate them may vary from those of other companies. As a result, the items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
This Proxy Statements contains references to certain non-GAAP measures, including in the CD&A section discussing the targets under the 2018 STIC program. The non-GAAP measures discussed in this Proxy Statement and their definitions are provided below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Average Operating Margin Per Ton Sold. Average operating margin per ton sold is defined as the average  revenue per ton sold net of average direct operating cost of coal sold per ton. The GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to average operating margin per ton sold is total coal revenue. Our average direct operating cost of coal sold per ton  represents our direct operating costs of coal sold divided by the tons of coal we sold. We define direct operating cost of coal sold as production costs directly related to produced tons sold. The direct operating cost of coal sold per ton includes  items such as labor and related expense, operating supplies, maintenance expense, contractor costs, utility expenses, and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs. Our direct operating costs exclude indirect costs such as royalty and  production taxes, administrative overhead expense, selling, general and administrative costs, freight expenses, interest expenses and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to  direct operating cost of coal sold is total costs.  
[END TABLE]
APPENDIX A 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Average Cash Margin Per Ton Sold. We define average cash margin per ton sold as average coal  revenue per ton, net of average cash cost of coal sold per ton. The GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to average cash margin per ton sold is total coal revenue. Our cost of coal sold per ton represents our costs of coal sold divided by  the tons of coal we sold. We define cost of coal sold as operating and other production costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in coal inventory, both in volumes and carrying values. The cost of coal sold per ton includes items such  as direct operating costs, royalty and production taxes, direct administration, and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs. Our costs exclude any indirect costs such as selling, general and administrative costs, freight expenses,  interest expenses and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash cost of coal sold is total costs. The cash cost of coal sold includes cost of coal sold less depreciation,  depletion and amortization cost on production assets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures  plus proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is net cash provided by operations.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Free Cash Flow Net to CEIX Stockholders. Free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders is defined as net cash  provided by operations less capital expenditures plus proceeds from the sale of non-core assets less distributions paid to noncontrolling CONSOL Coal Resources LP unitholders. The GAAP measure most directly  comparable to free cash flow net to CEIX stockholders is net cash provided by operations.
