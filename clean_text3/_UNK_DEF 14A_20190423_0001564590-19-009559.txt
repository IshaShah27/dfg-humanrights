THE MEETING
Date, Time and Place
We will hold the Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 5:30 p.m. CST on April 23, 2019 at The Legends Conference Center at 2500 Legends Circle, Prattville, Alabama.
Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum
Only holders of record of Company common stock as of February 21, 2019, will receive notice of the Annual Meeting, and only those shareholders will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of February 21, 2019, there were 5,701,139 shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 783 holders of record.
A quorum requires the presence, in person or by Proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes which all shareholders of the Company are entitled to cast on the record date.
We intend to count the following shares as present at the Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares of Company common stock present in person at the Annual Meeting but not voting;    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares of Company common stock represented by proxies on which the shareholder has abstained on any matter; and    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares of Company common stock represented by proxies from a broker with no indication of how the shares of Company common stock are to be voted.    
[END TABLE]
Votes Required
The election of the persons who will serve on the Board of Directors for the Company requires a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.
You have one vote for each share of Company common stock that you hold of record on each matter to be considered at the Annual Meeting.
The Directors and Executive Officers of the Company and of River Bank and Trust, who as a group own beneficially approximately 28.15% of the Company common stock, have stated their intention to vote all shares of Company common stock that they own for approval and adoption of all proposals described in this Proxy Statement.
Voting of Proxies
We will vote shares represented by all properly executed proxies received in time for the Annual Meeting in the manner specified on each Proxy. We will vote properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions in favor of the proposed directors and other items set forth in the notice of meeting, and if any other business is properly brought before the shareholders of record at the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors unless the proxy is marked to withhold authority to cast such vote.
If you abstain from voting or withhold your vote on any proposal considered at the Annual Meeting, we will not count the abstention or withhold as a vote "for" or "against" any of the proposals for purposes of the Annual Meeting.
Revocability of Proxies
If you grant a proxy, you may revoke your proxy at any time until it is voted by:
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Company will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from its shareholders.
The Company will solicit proxies by mail. In addition, the directors, officers and employees of the Company may solicit proxies from shareholders by telephone, in person, email or by any other lawful means. The Company will make arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by those persons, and the Company will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
PROPOSAL I - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The current number of directors of River Financial is seven. The Board of Directors unanimously voted to increase the size of the Board to eight members for purposes of electing directors at the annual meeting. Thus the Board recommends that the size of the board be set at eight and the following eight persons be elected as directors. Upon shareholder election, all eight directors will immediately begin their terms of service as indicated below.
If, prior to the voting at the Annual Meeting, any person to be elected a director is unable to serve or for good cause cannot serve, the shares represented by all valid proxies may be voted for the election of such substitute as the members of the Board of Directors may recommend. The Company knows of no reason why any person would be unable to serve as a director.
The following list provides certain biographical information about the director nominees to be elected at the annual meeting.

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 2 - AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO PROVIDE FOR A VARIABLE RANGE IN BOARD SIZE
The current number of directors of River Financial Corporation is seven. As set forth herein, the Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders authorize an increase in the size of the board to eight. Under the Alabama Business Corporation Law, the board of directors may increase or decrease the size of the board within a range set forth in the articles of incorporation subject to certain limits. The Board of Directors believes that permitting the Board to establish such a range will provide flexibility to River Financial  Corporation in the event of future acquisitions, opportunities to add expertise to the Board in certain areas, and general business development opportunities. Thus, the Board recommends that shareholders approve the  following amendment to the articles of incorporation as Article VIII of the Articles of Incorporation.  The amendment requires approval by a majority of votes cast:
Article VIII Board of Directors
All of the authority of the Corporation shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. For their own governance, the Directors may adopt bylaws that are not inconsistent with these Articles. The Bylaws shall establish a variable range for the Board of Directors by fixing a minimum and maximum number of Directors not to exceed 12. The Board may change the number of Directors within the variable range set by the Bylaws without shareholder approval, and fill the vacancies  created thereby, except that the Board may not increase or decrease by more than thirty percent (30%} the number of Directors last approved by the shareholders.
PROPOSAL 3 - APPROVAL OF THE ADDITION OF 300,000 SHARES TO RIVER FINANCIAL'S 2015 INCENTIVE STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN
The River Financial Corporation 2015 Incentive Stock Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), permits the board of directors to grant options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") respecting River Financial common stock to officers and employees of River Financial and River Bank & Trust. Under the Plan, a total of 300,000 shares of River Financial Common Stock were originally authorized to be issued and 29,500 shares are remaining for issue under the Plan. The Board of Directors recommends that an additional 300,000 shares be made available under the Plan.
Generally, the purpose of the Plan is to promote the interests of River Financial by providing an incentive to officers and employees of River Financial and its subsidiaries to remain in the employ of River Financial or its subsidiaries and to aid River Financial in attracting and developing capable management personnel. Pursuant to the Plan, such persons will continue to be offered an opportunity to acquire and increase a proprietary interest in River  Financial through awards of options to purchase Common Stock and other stock incentives such as SARs, restricted stock and RSUs (the "Awards"). Thus the Board of Directors recommends approval of the addition of 300,000 shares to the Plan. This amendment requires a majority vote of the  shares voting at the meeting. FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS
