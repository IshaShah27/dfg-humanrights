THE COMPANY 
We are a Bermuda exempted limited liability company that, through our subsidiaries, provides collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market and invests in various insurance-linked securities. We were incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on June 24, 2013 and we commenced operations on November 12, 2013. Our headquarters and principal executive offices are located at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke, Bermuda HM 08, which is also our registered office. 
Our Common Shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "BCRH" and on the Bermuda Stock Exchange under the symbol "BCRH.BH." 
Our business strategy is to build and maintain a diversified portfolio of reinsurance risks that will generate underwriting profits, which we intend principally to distribute to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, with returns commensurate with the amount of risk assumed. We seek to provide our Shareholders with the opportunity to own an alternative asset class whose returns we believe have historically been largely uncorrelated to those of other asset classes, such as global equities and bonds. Subject to the discretion of our Board, we intend to distribute a minimum of 90% of our annual Distributable Income to holders of our Common Shares. "Distributable Income," a non-GAAP measure, means our GAAP net income plus (minus) non-cash expenses (revenues) recorded in our net income for the period. Subject to the discretion of the Board, we intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments for each of the first three quarters of each year, and either repurchase Common Shares or pay a fourth "special" dividend after the end of the year, should circumstances warrant such a repurchase or special dividend. 
We operate as a single business segment through our wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Blue Capital Re Ltd. ("Blue Capital Re"), a Bermuda exempted limited liability company registered as a Class 3A insurer in Bermuda under the Insurance Act, which provides collateralized reinsurance; and (ii) Blue Capital Re ILS Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company that conducts hedging and other investment activities, including entering into industry loss warranties and purchasing catastrophe bonds, in support of Blue Capital Re's operations. 
Sompo International Holdings Ltd. ("Sompo International"), together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd. ("Endurance Bermuda"), owns 33.2% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. Through each of the following roles and relationships, we leverage Sompo International's reinsurance underwriting expertise and infrastructure to conduct our business: (i) Blue Capital Management Ltd. (the "Manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sompo International, manages our reinsurance underwriting decisions; (ii) Blue Water Re Ltd. ("Blue Water Re"), Sompo International's wholly-owned special purpose insurance company, is a significant source of reinsurance business for us; and (iii) certain employees of Sompo International also serve as our Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"), our Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"), our Secretary, and as two of our five directors, including the role of Chairman of the Board. 
We qualify as a "smaller reporting company" as defined in Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933. As a result, we are eligible to take advantage of scaled disclosure requirements about our executive compensation arrangements including, but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no requirement to include a compensation discussion and analysis;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no requirement to include the grants of plan-based awards table;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no requirement to include a Compensation Committee report; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no requirement to include disclosure of compensation committee interlocks and insider participation.   
[END TABLE]
We intend to continue to utilize some, but not all, of the exemptions available to smaller reporting companies until such time that we are no longer a smaller reporting company. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you invest.  BLUE CAPITAL REINSURANCE HOLDINGS LTD.

General Information 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting to be held at the Company's Principal Executive Offices at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda on May 8, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. Atlantic Daylight Time, or any postponement or adjournment thereof. This Proxy Statement, the Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and the accompanying form of proxy are being first mailed to Shareholders on or about March 26, 2019. 
As of March 14, 2019, the record date for the determination of persons entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the 2019 Annual Meeting, there were 8,767,165 Common Shares outstanding. Common Shares are the only class of our share capital entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Common Shares are quoted on the NYSE under the symbol "BCRH" and the Bermuda Stock Exchange under the symbol "BCRH.BH." 
Holders of Common Shares are entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon by the Shareholders for each Common Share held. 
The presence of two or more persons present in person and representing in person or by proxy in excess of 50% of the total combined voting power (that is, the number of maximum possible votes entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting) of all of the issued and outstanding Common Shares throughout the meeting shall form a quorum for the transaction of business at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, Shareholders will also receive the report of our independent registered public accounting firm and may be asked to consider and take action with respect to such other matters as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Except for the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of an advisory vote to approve executive compensation, which will be decided by the option that receives the most votes (every one, two or three years), each of the other proposals presented herein will be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Shares voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting, provided a quorum is present. The Company intends to conduct all voting at the 2019 Annual Meeting by poll to be requested by the Chairman of the meeting, in accordance with the Company's Bye-Laws. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to Be Held on May 8, 2019. The Proxy Statement and the 2018 Form 10-K are available at https://materials.proxyvote.com/G1190F.  About the 2019 Annual Meeting 
Where and when will the 2019 Annual Meeting be held? 
The 2019 Annual Meeting will be held at the Company's Principal Executive Offices at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda on May 8, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. Atlantic Daylight Time. 
What will I be voting on? 
At this meeting you will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals: 
1) To fix the number of directors of the Company at five and to elect one Class C director nominee to the Company's Board for a term ending in 2022, 
2) To approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote"), 
3) To select, by a non-binding advisory vote, the frequency of the Say-on-Pay Vote (every one, two or three years), and 
4) To appoint Ernst & Young Ltd., an independent registered public accounting firm, as the Company's independent auditor for 2019 and to authorize the Board, acting by the Company's Audit Committee, to set their remuneration. 
In addition, we will consider any other business as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
Who can vote? 
You can vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting if you were a holder of record of Common Shares as of the close of business on March 14, 2019. Each Common Share is generally entitled to one vote. 
How do I vote my Common Shares? 
You can vote either in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting or by proxy whether or not you can attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
To vote by proxy, you must either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• complete the enclosed proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote by telephone (instructions are on the proxy card), or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote by internet (instructions are on the proxy card).  
[END TABLE]
Can I change my vote? 
Yes. Any Shareholder who executes a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted by delivering to the Secretary of the Company at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda, a written statement revoking such proxy, by executing and delivering a later dated proxy, or by voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
What if I do not vote for some of the matters listed on my proxy card? 
Shareholders of Record. If you are the Shareholder of record and you do not vote your shares by proxy card or voting instruction form, by telephone, via the internet or in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Beneficial Owners. If you are the beneficial owner of your Common Shares and you do not provide specific instructions, your broker or other nominee may vote your shares only on those proposals on which your broker or nominee has discretion to vote. Under the rules of the NYSE, your broker or nominee does not have discretion to vote your uninstructed shares on non-routine matters, such as Proposals 1, 2 and Proposal 3, resulting in "broker non-votes," which are not considered votes cast and therefore have no effect on the outcome of such proposals. However, your broker or other nominee does have discretion to vote your shares on routine matters such as Proposal 4. 
How many votes are required to elect Directors and to adopt the proposals? 
For Proposal 3, "Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Select the Frequency of the Say-on-Pay Vote," the option that receives the most votes—every one, two or three years—will be considered the frequency approved by our Shareholders. The election of directors and each of the other proposals presented herein will be decided by the affirmative majority of the votes cast at the 2019 Annual Meeting, provided a quorum is present. The Company intends to conduct all voting at the 2019 Annual Meeting by poll to be requested by the Chairman of the meeting, in accordance with the Company's Bye-Laws. While the advisory vote on Proposals 2 and 3, "Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote")" and "Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Select the Frequency of the Say-on-Pay Vote," respectively, will not be binding upon the Company, the Board and the Compensation Committee expect to consider the outcome of these votes when considering executive compensation and in determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Could other matters be decided at the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
Neither the Board nor management intends to bring before the meeting any business other than the matters referred to in the Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement. If any other business should come properly before the meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof, the proxyholders will vote on such matters at their discretion. 
What happens if the meeting is postponed or adjourned? 
Your proxy will still be valid and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted. 
How can I access proxy materials and the 2018 Form 10-K electronically? 
The Proxy Statement and the 2018 Form 10-K are available at https://materials.proxyvote.com/G1190F.  Solicitation and Revocation 
PROXIES IN THE FORM ENCLOSED ARE BEING SOLICITED BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, THE BOARD. THE PERSONS NAMED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FORM OF PROXY HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS PROXIES BY THE BOARD. 
Such persons designated as proxies serve as officers of the Company. Any Shareholder desiring to appoint another person to represent him or her at the 2019 Annual Meeting may do so by completing another form of proxy and delivering an executed proxy to the Secretary of the Company at the address indicated herein before the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting. It is the responsibility of the Shareholder appointing such other person to represent him or her as proxy to inform such person of this appointment. 
All Common Shares represented by properly executed proxies that are returned and not revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions given thereon. If no instructions are provided in a properly executed proxy, it will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations as set forth on the accompanying form of proxy, and in accordance with the proxyholder's best judgment as to any other business as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting. If a Shareholder appoints a person other than the person named in the enclosed form of proxy to represent him or her, such person will vote the Common Shares in respect of which he or she is appointed proxyholder in accordance with the directions of the Shareholder appointing him or her. Any Shareholder who executes a proxy may revoke it at any time before the commencement of the 2019 Annual Meeting by delivering to the Secretary of the Company at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda, a written statement revoking such proxy, by executing and delivering a later dated proxy, or by voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting by a Shareholder who has executed and delivered a proxy to us shall not constitute a revocation of such proxy. 
Member brokerage firms of the NYSE that hold Common Shares in street name for beneficial owners may, to the extent that such beneficial owners do not furnish voting instructions, vote in their discretion upon the proposal to appoint Ernst & Young Ltd., an independent registered public accounting firm, as the Company's independent auditor for 2019 and to authorize the Company's Board, acting by the Company's Audit Committee, to set their remuneration. The election of directors, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation and the advisory vote on the frequency of an advisory vote to approve executive compensation are considered to be non-routine matters upon which a broker will not have discretionary authority to vote if no instructions are given by the beneficial owner of the Common Shares. Broker non-votes occur when Common Shares held for a beneficial owner are not voted. If a Shareholder abstains from voting, or if a Shareholder's Common Shares are treated as a broker non-vote, those Common Shares will not be considered as votes cast "For" or "Against" the proposal, but will be included in the number of Common Shares represented for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. 
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies. We have engaged the firm of Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to assist us in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $1,500, plus the reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Solicitation may be made by our directors and officers personally, by telephone, by internet or otherwise, but such persons will not be specifically compensated for such services. We may also make, through bankers, brokers or other persons, a solicitation of proxies of beneficial holders of the Common Shares. Upon request, we will reimburse brokers, dealers, banks or similar entities acting as nominees for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding copies of the proxy materials relating to the 2019 Annual Meeting to the beneficial owners of Common Shares that such persons hold of record.  PROPOSAL 1 
APPROVAL OF A FIVE MEMBER BOARD AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Bye-Laws provide for a classified Board, divided into three classes of approximately equal size. Each director serves a three-year term, except in the case of a director appointed to fill a casual vacancy. Currently, the Board consists of five directors. 
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, Shareholders are requested to fix the number of directors at five and to elect one Class C director nominee to the Board for a term ending in 2022. 
Eric Lemieux has been nominated for election as a director at the 2019 Annual Meeting by the Company's Compensation and Nominating Committee (the "Compensation Committee"). If elected, Mr. Lemieux will serve as Class C director for a three-year term expiring at the Company's 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders or until his successor is elected and qualified. In the event that Shareholders fail to elect the director nominee, the number of directors previously elected shall be deemed to be the number of directors so fixed. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR" PROPOSAL 1, WHICH CALLS FOR THE APPROVAL OF A FIVE MEMBER BOARD AND ELECTION OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEE.  DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Directors and Director Nominees

We believe Mr. Cook's qualifications to serve on our Board include his extensive experience in the global insurance and reinsurance industries, including his executive management positions at major Bermuda-based reinsurance companies.

Corporate Governance and Related Matters 
The Board acts as the Company's ultimate decision maker and advises and oversees management, which is responsible for day-to-day operations. The Company has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and Procedures (the "Corporate Governance Guidelines") to provide a framework for the governance of the Company. This document is available on our website at (www.bcapre.bm > Corporate Governance > Corporate Governance Documents > Corporate Governance Guidelines and Procedures) and may also be obtained at no charge upon written request to the attention of the Company Secretary at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda. 
Code of Conduct and Ethics 
The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Conduct and Ethics") for all its directors, officers and employees, including the Company's CEO and CFO. This document is available on our website at (www.bcapre.bm > Corporate Governance > Corporate Governance Documents > Code of Conduct and Ethics) and may also be obtained at no charge upon written request to the attention of the Company Secretary at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda. Any waiver of any part of the Code of Conduct and Ethics for executive officers or directors may be made only by the Board (or the Audit Committee). Any such waivers or any amendments to the Code of Conduct and Ethics requiring disclosure under SEC and NYSE rules will be promptly disclosed on our website.  The Board and Committees 
The Board 
The Board currently consists of five members and is elected by Shareholders pursuant to the Company's Bye-Laws. The Board is divided into three classes, Class A, Class B and Class C, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term. The Board selects our CEO and our CFO, who are charged with the conduct of our business. After selecting the senior management team, the Board acts as an advisor to senior management and ultimately monitors its performance. The Board's ability to monitor senior management's performance is facilitated by the presence of independent directors who have experience in the reinsurance business. 
The Board has determined that the positions of CEO and Chairman may be held by the same individual. The Board believes that its current leadership structure is appropriate for the Company at this time. As CEO and Chairman, Mr. McGuire is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company and presides over meetings of the Board. The Lead Director, Mr. Lemieux, leads meetings of the non-management directors and acts as liaison between the non-management directors and the CEO. 
Sompo International has the right to nominate two out of our five directors (or, if the Board consists of more than five directors, no less than 40% of the total Board seats at any given time), until the later of the date on which: (i) Sompo International sells any Common Shares; and (ii) Sompo International owns less than 5% of the total Common Shares outstanding. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance shareholder value. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The involvement of the full Board in setting the Company's business strategy is a key part of its assessment of management's appetite for risk and also a determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company. 
The Board receives regular reports from the Manager on the risk management work undertaken by management and the extent of any action taken to address areas identified for improvement. The Board defines the risk measures and risk management processes to be used within the Company, including the definition of the Company's risk appetite and its risk tolerances. Discussions of risk management reporting, risk tolerance, risk measurement, capital management and corporate strategy take place at each of the Board meetings. 
Director Independence 
Members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee must meet all applicable independence tests as defined by the NYSE, the SEC and the Company's Categorical Standards for Director Independence (the Company's "Independence Standards") as adopted by the Board and attached hereto as Appendix A. This document is also available on our website at (www.bcapre.bm > Corporate Governance > Corporate Governance Documents > Corporate Governance Guidelines and Procedures). 
The Board and the Compensation Committee have reviewed the responses of directors and director nominees to a questionnaire asking about their direct and indirect relationships with the Company (including those of their immediate family members) and other potential conflicts of interest, as well as pertinent materials provided by management related to transactions, relationships or arrangements between the Company and the directors or director nominees or parties related thereto. 
The Board has concluded that each of Messrs. Cook, Lemieux and Weale is independent in accordance with the director independence standards of the NYSE, the SEC and the Company's Independence Standards and that   none of Messrs. Cook, Lemieux and Weale has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his independence from management or otherwise compromise his ability to act as an independent director. Neither Mr. McGuire nor Mr. Del Col, by virtue of his directorships or management positions with Sompo International or its subsidiaries, is considered to be an independent director. Accordingly, the majority of the Board is comprised of independent directors. 
Board and Committee Meetings 
During 2018 there were four meetings of the full Board, four meetings of the Audit Committee and two meetings of the Compensation Committee. During 2018, each of our directors attended over 75% of the meetings of the full Board and committees during the period such director was a member. 
As Lead Director, Mr. Lemieux attends and presides over each regularly scheduled executive session of non-management directors. The Board meets in executive session at least once during each year with only independent directors present. 
It is the Board's policy that all directors will attend, or otherwise participate in, our Annual General Meetings of Shareholders unless unavoidably prevented from doing so. Each of our directors attended the 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board had two standing committees during 2018, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. 
The following table outlines the current members of each of the committees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Audit Committee 
The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are "independent" within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Board has also determined that all members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and that, at a minimum, D. Andrew Cook meets the requirements of being an "Audit Committee Financial Expert" under Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K. 
The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the Company's internal audit activities and the independence, qualifications and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Specifically, these duties include: (i) selecting and overseeing the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; (ii) reviewing the scope of the audit to be conducted by them, as well as the results of their audit; (iii) overseeing the Company's financial reporting activities, including its annual and quarterly reports to Shareholders, and the accounting standards and principles followed; (iv) overseeing the review of the financial reporting process and internal audit activities that are designed to provide management and the Audit Committee with assessments of the Company's risk management processes and internal control systems; (v) approving audit   and non-audit services provided to the Company by the independent registered public accounting firm; (vi) reviewing the organization and scope of the Company's internal audit activities; (vii) addressing requests for waivers of conflict of interest situations; (viii) overseeing the Company's legal and regulatory compliance; (ix) overseeing the Company's disclosure and internal controls; (x) preparing the report of the Audit Committee required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement; (xi) providing an avenue of communication among the independent auditors, management and the Board; and (xii) fulfilling all other duties and responsibilities as outlined within the Committee's charter. 
The Audit Committee has established a charter, which outlines its primary duties and responsibilities. This document is available on our website at (www.bcapre.bm > Corporate Governance > Corporate Governance Documents > Audit Committee Charter) and also may be obtained at no charge upon written request to the attention of the Company Secretary at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda. The Audit Committee's report appears on page 14 of this Proxy Statement. 
Compensation Committee 
The Board has determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are "independent" within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
The principal duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee related to compensation include: (i) establishing, maintaining and administering compensation and benefit policies designed to attract, motivate and retain personnel with the requisite skills and abilities to enable us to achieve superior operating results; (ii) approving and reviewing performance measures; (iii) evaluating performance and reviewing and approving all salary and incentive payments and equity awards for our executive officers; (iv) recommending to the Board management succession for all of our executive officers; (v) assisting in discharging the Board's responsibilities regarding all compensation matters; (vi) overseeing the administration of our compensation plans; (vii) reviewing and making recommendations on the compensation of our non-management directors; (viii) overseeing our compliance with the compensation rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated by the NYSE, the SEC and other law, as applicable; (ix) reviewing and discussing with management executive compensation information and making a recommendation to the Board as to whether such information shall be included in the appropriate regulatory filings; and (x) fulfilling all other duties and responsibilities as outlined within the Compensation Committee's charter. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement with the Manager, which is described in more detail under the heading "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Service Agreements with Sompo International" beginning on page 20 of this Proxy Statement, the Manager provides us with, among other things, the services of our CFO, Mr. Garside, our CEO, Mr. McGuire, and our Secretary, Mr. Del Col, and is compensated for such services in accordance with the Administrative Services Agreement and the Investment Management Agreement. Nonetheless, the Compensation Committee is responsible for all aspects of compensation and benefits policies for any executive officers we may hire in the future. Our executive officers do not have any role in making determinations or recommendations regarding director compensation. 
Neither the Compensation Committee nor management retained a compensation consultant during 2018. 
The Compensation Committee is also responsible for nominating candidates for election to the Board and for reviewing and making recommendations on matters involving the general operation of the Board and our corporate governance. 
The principal duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee related to nominating and corporate governance include: (i) establishing criteria for Board and committee membership and recommending to the Board proposed nominees for election to the Board and for membership on committees of the Board;   (ii) searching for qualified director candidates as needed and reviewing background information of candidates for selection to the Board, including those recommended by Shareholders, and making recommendations to the Board regarding such candidates; (iii) assisting the Board in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members consistent with criteria approved by the Board and set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and recommending director nominees to the Board; (iv) evaluating whether each director candidate is independent, is financially literate, has accounting or related financial management expertise, qualifies as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert" under Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K and is free of any conflict of interest or the appearance of any conflict of interest with the best interests of us and Shareholders; (v) identifying potential nominees for director through director suggestions, management recommendations, business, insurance industry and other contacts and Shareholder nominations; (vi) to the extent it deems appropriate, engaging a third-party search firm and other advisors to identify potential nominees for director; (vii) taking a leadership role on shaping our corporate governance; (viii) making recommendations to the Board regarding board governance matters and practices; and (ix) fulfilling all other duties and responsibilities as outlined within the Compensation Committee's charter. 
Pursuant to the Compensation Committee's charter, a nominee recommended for a position on the Board should meet the following minimum qualifications: (i) such nominee must be over 21 years of age; (ii) such nominee must have the highest standards of integrity; (iii) such nominee must have significant accomplishments in his or her chosen field of expertise; (iv) such nominee must have experience with a high degree of responsibility in a business, non-profit organization, educational institution, professional services firm or other organization; (v) such nominee must be able to commit the appropriate time for preparing for Board meetings, attending meetings and other corporate governance matters; (vi) such nominee must be able to read and understand basic financial statements; and (vii) such nominee must be familiar with the role of the board of directors in a company. The Compensation Committee may determine that members of the Board should have diverse experiences, skills and perspectives as well as knowledge in the areas of insurance, reinsurance, investment, financial services and other aspects of the Company's activities. 
The Compensation Committee has established a charter, which outlines its primary duties and responsibilities. This document is available on our website at (www.bcapre.bm > Corporate Governance > Corporate Governance Documents > Compensation and Nominating Committee Charter) and may also be obtained at no charge upon written request to the attention of the Company Secretary at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM08, Bermuda.

At each regularly-scheduled meeting of the Board, the CEO or his designee shall present a summary of all communications received since the last meeting that were not forwarded and upon request shall make such communications available to any or all of the directors. 
Audit Committee Report 
The following report is not deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and the report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any prior or subsequent filing by the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. 
Messrs. Cook, Lemieux and Weale currently serve on the Audit Committee. All current members of the Audit Committee will continue as members of the Audit Committee, assuming Mr. Lemieux is re-elected to the Board by the Shareholders. 
After reviewing the qualifications of the current members of the Audit Committee, and any relationships they may have with the Company that might affect their independence from the Company, the Board has determined that (i) all current Audit Committee members are "independent" as that concept is defined in Section 10A of the Exchange Act, the SEC rules promulgated thereunder, and the applicable NYSE Corporate   Governance Rules, (ii) all current Audit Committee members are financially literate, and (iii) Mr. Cook qualifies as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert" under Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K. Shareholders should understand that this designation is an SEC disclosure requirement related to Mr. Cook's experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose upon Mr. Cook any duties, obligations or liability greater than are generally imposed upon him as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board and his designation as a financial expert pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board. Other currently serving members of the Audit Committee and the Board may be considered financial experts, but the Board has not so designated them at this time. 
The Board appointed the undersigned directors as members of the Audit Committee and adopted a written charter setting forth the procedures and responsibilities of the committee. Each year, the Audit Committee reviews the charter and reports to the Board on its adequacy in light of applicable NYSE rules. The charter is available on the Company's web site at www.bcapre.bm and is also available in print upon request to the Company. In addition, the Company will furnish an annual written affirmation to the NYSE relating to, among other things, clauses (i)—(iii) of the preceding paragraph of this report and the adequacy of the Audit Committee charter. 
During the last year, and earlier this year in preparation for the filing with the SEC of the Company's 2018 Form 10-K, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2018 Form  10-K with management and the Company's independent auditors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the Company's quarterly earnings press releases and related materials;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed the overall scope and plans for the audit and the results of the independent auditors'  examinations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed the Company's loss reserves;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• met separately with management periodically during the year to consider the adequacy of the Company's  internal controls and the quality of its financial reporting and discussed these matters with the Company's independent auditors and with senior management and internal auditors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discussed with the Company's senior management, independent auditors and internal auditors the process used  for the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer to make the certifications required by the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in connection with the Form 10-K and other  periodic filings with the SEC;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed the Company's whistleblower policy and its application;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• met with the independent auditors privately and with management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed with the independent auditors (i) their judgments as to the quality (and not just the  acceptability) of the Company's accounting policies, (ii) the matters required to be discussed with the committee under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, including Auditing Standard No. 1301,  "Communications with Audit Committees" and (iii) responsibilities, budget and staffing of the Company's internal audit function;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• received from the independent auditors written disclosures regarding the auditors' independence required by  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence," and discussed with the independent auditors their independence; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• based on these reviews and discussions, as well as private discussions with the independent auditors and the  Company's internal auditors, recommended to the Board the inclusion of the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries in the 2018 Form 10-K.  
[END TABLE]
 In addition to the actions described above taken in connection with the preparation for the filing with the SEC of the Company's 2018 Form 10-K, the Audit Committee oversees the internal audit services provided by the Manager to the Company. The committee reviews the proposed audit plans for the coming year and the coordination of such plans with the independent auditors. The Company's internal audit objective is to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the Company's governance, risk management and internal control. To assist with the Audit Committee's oversight, the Manager's internal audit department provides an annual risk-based audit plan to the Audit Committee and periodic reports are additionally made to the Audit Committee summarizing the results of internal audit activities. 
The Audit Committee appoints and annually evaluates the performance of the Company's independent auditor and provides assistance to the members of the Board in fulfilling their oversight functions of the financial reporting practices. The Company's current independent registered public accounting firm is Ernst & Young Ltd. ("Ernst & Young"). Ernst & Young has been the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since July 2015, and the Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young to be the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
The Audit Committee contracts with and sets the fees paid to the Company's independent auditor. The fees for services for Ernst & Young's audit services during 2018 are set forth under "Professional Fees Billed to the Company." Audit fees relate to professional services rendered for the audit of consolidated financial statements of the Company, audits of the consolidated financial statements of Blue Capital Re and review of quarterly consolidated financial statements. 
The Audit Committee also determines that the non-audit services provided to the Company by the independent auditors are compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are discussed below under "Professional Fees Billed to the Company." The Audit Committee annually conducts an evaluation of the independent auditors to determine if they will recommend the retention of the independent auditors. As part of the evaluation of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee surveys management and all members of the Audit Committee to determine if the independent auditors are meeting Company expectations. In addition, the Audit Committee obtains and reviews, at least annually, a report by the independent auditors describing; the firm's internal quality-control procedures; any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to deal with any such issues; and (to assess the independent auditors' independence) all relationships between the independent auditors and the Company. Based upon the results of the evaluations mentioned, the Audit Committee recommends the retention of Ernst & Young as the Company's independent auditors based upon the quality of audit services and sufficiency of resources provided. 
While the Audit Committee has the duties and responsibilities set forth above and in its charter, the Audit Committee is not responsible for planning or conducting the audit or for determining whether the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Similarly, it is not the responsibility of the Audit Committee to ensure that the Company complies with all laws and regulations, its Code of Conduct and Ethics or its Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
In fulfilling their responsibilities hereunder, it is recognized that members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Company, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to set auditor independence standards, and each member of the Audit Committee shall be entitled to rely on (i) the integrity of those persons and organizations within and outside the Company from which it receives information, (ii) the accuracy of the financial and other information provided to the committee absent actual knowledge to the contrary (which shall be promptly reported to the Board) and (iii) statements made by management or third parties as to any information technology, internal audit and other non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to the Company.  The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and the independent and internal auditors, including private discussions with the independent auditors and the Company's internal auditors and receives the communications described above. The Audit Committee has also established procedures for (a) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and (b) the confidential, anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. However, this oversight does not provide us with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions with management and the independent auditors do not assure that the Company's financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.

The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits all our directors, officers and employees from buying or selling options on Common Shares, from hedging the value of Common Shares and from pledging Common Shares as collateral.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy (the "Related Person Transaction Policy"), which is available on our website at (www.bcapre.bm > Corporate Governance > Corporate Governance Documents > Related Person Transaction Policy). Under this Related Person Transaction policy, all relationships between us and any of our directors, executive officers, beneficial holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities or their immediate family members will be reviewed by our Audit Committee to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest in a proposed transaction. This Related Person Transaction Policy will not be applicable to day-to-day allocation, underwriting or investment decisions of the Manager, but it will be applicable to any changes to the terms of any agreements we have entered into with the Manager. 
The Audit Committee will review and approve or ratify any related person transactions. In the course of its review, the Audit Committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the material terms of the transaction, including the amount and type of the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer in acting in our best  interests;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the importance of the transaction to the related person; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any other matters it deems appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
Any member of the Audit Committee who is a related person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or any vote respecting approval or ratification of the transaction; provided, however, that such director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Audit Committee to consider the transaction. 
We have entered into transactions with parties that are related to the Company. We believe that each of these transactions, as described below, was made on terms no less favorable to us than we could have obtained from unrelated parties. 
Service Agreements with Sompo International 
Through each of the following roles and relationships, we leverage Sompo International's reinsurance underwriting expertise and infrastructure to conduct our business: (i) the Manager manages our reinsurance underwriting decisions; (ii) Blue Water Re, Sompo International's wholly-owned special purpose insurance company, is a significant source of our reinsurance business (as described below); (iii) Mr. McGuire, Sompo International's CFO and the Manager's Chief Executive Officer and director, serves as our CEO and Chairman of the Board; (iv) Mr. Garside, the Controller and Vice President of Sompo International and the Treasurer of the Manager, serves as our CFO; and (v) Mr. Del Col, Sompo International's General Counsel and a director of the Manager, serves as our Secretary and a director. 
All of the compensation to which Messrs. Del Col and McGuire are entitled as directors of the Company has been assigned and paid directly to Sompo International. 
Sompo International provides services to Blue Capital through the following arrangements: 
BW Retrocessional Agreement. Through a retrocessional contract dated December 31, 2013 (the "BW Retrocessional Agreement"), between Blue Capital Re and Blue Water Re, Blue Water Re has the option to cede   to Blue Capital Re up to 100% of its participation in the ceded reinsurance business it writes, provided that such business is in accordance with the Company's underwriting guidelines. Pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement, Blue Capital Re may participate in: (i) retrocessional, quota share or other agreements between Blue Water Re and Sompo International or other third-party reinsurers, which provides it with the opportunity to participate in a diversified portfolio of risks on a proportional basis; and (ii) fronting agreements between Blue Water Re and Sompo International or other well capitalized third-party rated reinsurers, which allows Blue Capital Re to transact business with counterparties who prefer to enter into contracts with rated reinsurers. 
Investment Management Agreement. The Company has entered into an Investment Management Agreement with the Manager. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Manager has full discretionary authority, including the delegation of the provision of its services, to manage the Company's assets, subject to the Company's underwriting guidelines, the terms of the Investment Management Agreement and the oversight of the Board. 
Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement. The Company, Blue Capital Re and the Manager have entered into an Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement (the "Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement"). Pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, the Manager provides underwriting, risk management, claims management, ceded retrocession agreements management and actuarial and reinsurance accounting services to Blue Capital Re. The Manager has full discretionary authority to manage the underwriting decisions of Blue Capital Re, subject to the Company's underwriting guidelines, the terms of the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement and the oversight of the Company's and Blue Capital Re's boards of directors. 
Administrative Services Agreement. The Company has entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with the Manager, as amended on November 13, 2014 (the "Administrative Services Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement, the Manager provides Blue Capital with support services, including the services of our CEO, CFO and Secretary, as well as finance and accounting, internal audit, claims management and policy wording, modeling software licenses, office space, information technology, human resources and administrative support.  Amounts Incurred Under Service Agreements with 
Sompo International 
The following table summarizes the fees payable to the Manager pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement and certain other terms of these agreements: 
Summary Description 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Management Fee    The Manager is entitled to a management fee (the "Management Fee") of 1.5% of our average total shareholders' equity per annum, calculated and payable in arrears in cash each quarter (or part thereof) that the  Investment Management Agreement is in effect. For purposes of calculating the Management Fee, our total shareholders' equity means: (1) the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata  daily basis for such issuances during the quarter of any such issuance), plus (2) our retained earnings as of the end of the most recently completed quarter (without taking into account any non-cash  compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), minus (3) any amount that we may have paid to repurchase our Common Shares on a cumulative basis since inception. It also excludes (x) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted shareholders' equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than unrealized gains and losses and other  non-cash items relating to insurance-linked securities, and (y) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP after discussions between the Manager and our  independent directors and approval by both a majority of our independent directors and the Manager for all such adjustments. As a result, our shareholders' equity, for purposes of calculating the Management Fee, could be greater or less than  the amount of shareholders' equity shown on our financial statements. 
 Performance Fee    The Manager is entitled to a performance fee (the "Performance Fee") calculated and payable in arrears in cash each quarter (or part thereof) that the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement is in effect in an  amount, not less than zero, equal to the product of (1) 20% and (2) the difference between (A) our pre-tax, pre-Performance Fee Distributable Income for  the then current quarter and (B) a hurdle amount calculated as the product of (i) the weighted average of the issue price per Common Share pursuant to each of our public or private offerings of Common Shares since our inception multiplied  by the weighted average number of all Common Shares outstanding (including any restricted share units, any restricted Common Shares and other Common Shares underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans), as further reduced by the  amount, if any, by which our inception-to-date dividends to shareholders exceeds our  inception-to-date GAAP net income, and (ii) 2% (equivalent to an 8% annualized hurdle rate); provided, however, that the foregoing Performance Fee is subject to a  rolling three-year high water mark. 
 Term    We generally may not terminate the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement or the Administrative Services Agreement until November 5, 2021, whether or not the Manager's  performance results are satisfactory. Each of these agreements renews automatically on November 5, 2021, and every three years thereafter, unless terminated in accordance with its terms. During the term of these agreements, we may not enter  into any other investment management, underwriting and insurance management or services agreement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Termination Fee    Upon any termination or non-renewal of either of the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement (other than for a material breach by, or the  insolvency of, the Manager), we will pay a one-time termination fee to the Manager equal to 5% of our GAAP shareholders' equity, calculated as of the most recently completed quarter prior to the date of  termination. 
 Expense Reimbursement    Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement and the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, we reimburse the Manager for various fees, expenses and other costs in connection with the services provided under  the terms of these agreements. The only fees payable under the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement are to reimburse the Manager for various fees, expenses and other costs in connection with the services provided under the terms of that  agreement, including the services of our CFO, modeling software licenses and finance, legal and administrative support. 
[END TABLE]
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $1.8 million pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, $0.6 million pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement and nil pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $2.4 million pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, $0.6 million pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement and $0.4 million pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company owed Sompo International $1.0 million and $0.7 million for the services performed pursuant to the aforementioned agreements, respectively. 
Credit Facility 
On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into the 2016 Credit Facility with Endurance Investment Holdings Ltd. (the "Lender"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sompo International. The 2016 Credit Facility provides the Company with an unsecured $20.0 million revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility bear interest, set at the time of the borrowing, at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 150 basis points. A one-time fee of $20,000 was due to the Lender in connection with establishing the 2016 Credit Facility. The 2016 Credit Facility was amended on July 31, 2018 to extend its expiry to September 30, 2020 under identical terms. On November 30, 2018, Endurance Investment Holdings Ltd. was merged into its parent, Endurance Bermuda, and the obligations of the Lender were assumed by Endurance Bermuda. 
The 2016 Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the Company's ability, among other things, to grant liens on its assets, sell assets, merge or consolidate, or incur debt. If the Company fails to comply with any of these covenants, the Lender could revoke the facility and exercise remedies against the Company. In addition, in the event of a default in the performance of any of the agreements or covenants under certain management agreements with the Manager by the Company, the Lender has the right to terminate the 2016 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all of its respective covenants associated with the 2016 Credit Facility. 
On October 8, 2018, the Company borrowed $3.0 million under the 2016 Credit Facility. On December 21, 2018, the Company borrowed a further $1.0 million under the 2016 Credit Facility to support general corporate expense obligations for the period. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $4.0 million outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility.  During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company paid interest on its borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility of less than $0.1 million and nil, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not incur any facility or structuring fees in connection with the 2016 Credit Facility. 
Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement 
Private Placement. Upon the completion of the initial public offering and through the Private Placement, Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd. purchased 2,500,000 Common Shares at a price of $20.00 per share. In connection with the Private Placement, we entered into a shareholder and registration rights agreement, dated November 12, 2013 (the "Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement"), with Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd., now by operation of law, Sompo International. 
Governance. Pursuant to the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, Sompo International has the right to nominate two of our five directors (or, if the Board consists of more than five directors, not less than 40% of the total Board seats at any given time) until the later of the date on which: (i) Sompo International sells any Common Shares; and (ii) Sompo International owns less than 5% of the outstanding Common Shares. Sompo International also has the right to designate one of its nominees as Chairman. 
Pursuant to the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, for so long as Sompo International has the right to nominate two directors to the Board; (i) if the size of the Board is five, a quorum of the Board cannot exist unless at least one director nominated by Sompo International is present at a meeting of the Board; and (ii) if the size of the Board is greater than five, a quorum of the Board cannot exist unless at least two directors nominated by Sompo International are present at a meeting of the Board. 
Registration Rights. Pursuant to the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, we have granted Sompo International registration rights with respect to the Common Shares purchased in the Private Placement and any other Common Shares Sompo International may own. These rights include demand registration rights, shelf registration rights and "piggyback" registration rights, as well as customary indemnification. All fees, costs and expenses related to any registrations will be borne by us, other than underwriting discounts and commissions. 
Demand Registration Rights. The Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement grants Sompo International demand registration rights. We are required, upon the written request of Sompo International, to use our reasonable best efforts to effect registration of those Common Shares requested to be registered by Sompo International promptly after receipt of the request. We are not required to effect any such demand registration within 180 days after the effective date of a previous demand registration. 
Shelf Registration Rights. The Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement grants Sompo International shelf registration rights. Sompo International may demand that we file a shelf registration statement with respect to some or all of the Common Shares it holds, and, upon such demand, we are required to use our reasonable best efforts to effect such registration. 
Piggyback Registration Rights. The Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement grants Sompo International piggyback registration rights. If we register any Common Shares, either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, Sompo International is entitled, subject to certain limitations, to include some or all of the Common Shares it holds in the registration. 
Corporate Opportunities. Pursuant to the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, Sompo International or any of its affiliates or any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees, partners or agents are permitted to engage in activities or businesses that are competitive with us and will have no duty to refrain from engaging in such activities or businesses. The Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement also generally releases Sompo International or any of its affiliates or any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees, partners or agents from referring any business opportunity to us.  Preemptive Rights. Pursuant to the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, we have granted Sompo International preemptive rights to participate, at Sompo International's option, in any offerings of our equity securities. Sompo International's preemptive rights entitle it to participate in any issuance of equity securities by us based on Sompo International's pro rata portion of Common Shares that it holds at the time of such issuance. 
General. The Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement provides that, except as required by applicable law, neither we nor the Board shall take any action to cause the amendment of our organizational documents in a manner that is inconsistent with, or adverse to, Sompo International's governance and related rights under the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement. In addition, our Bye-Laws will be read and construed as one with the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, and the provisions of the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement are incorporated into such Bye-Laws.  SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us or written representations from certain reporting persons, during the year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the directors, executive officers and greater than 10% Shareholders were complied with by such persons on a timely basis.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Named Executive Officer Compensation 
We do not have any employees. We do not have the staff or capability to manage our underwriting or investment practices within our organization. Instead, we have outsourced these functions to the Manager, subject to oversight by our CEO, our CFO and the Board. Our CEO and CFO are employees of Sompo International and they provide us with these services pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement and Investment Management Agreement. 
Mr. McGuire, our CEO, Mr. Garside, our CFO, and Mr. Del Col, our Secretary, serve as our "Named Executive Officers." None of our Named Executive Officers receives any compensation directly from the Company in exchange for their services as executive officers. Rather, Mr. McGuire's and Mr. Del Col's services are deemed to be encompassed within the Management Fee we are charged by the Manager under the Investment Management Agreement and Mr. Garside's services are directly charged to us by the Manager under the Administrative Services Agreement. The compensation paid to each of our Named Executive Officers in respect of their services as executive officers is determined and paid by Sompo International. 
While no portion of the compensation paid to Mr. McGuire or Mr. Del Col is specifically allocated or paid to them based on the services that they provide to us, we have reasonably estimated based on the approximate time and costs they allocate to the Manager in respect of the Company that the aggregate amount of compensation paid to them in respect of 2018 that may reasonably be associated with the services they provide to the Company as executive officers was approximately $312,000 in the aggregate, which represents 18% of the Management Fee we are charged by the Manager under the Investment Management Agreement. In addition, the Company pays the Manager a fixed service fee of $375,000 per annum for Mr. Garside's services as CFO pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement. Accordingly, the total compensation of our Named Executive Officers that may reasonably be associated with the services they provided to the Company in respect of 2018 was approximately $687,000 in the aggregate. We have reasonably estimated that a total of 41% of this compensation represents fixed pay and the remaining 59% represents incentive or variable pay. The variable incentive or variable portion of this compensation was paid based on the financial and strategic performance of Sompo International. 
The following table summarizes the total compensation for each of the Company's Named Executive Officers during the year ended December 31, 2018:

2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, incentive awards, the value of which are based on Common Shares, may be made to the Company's directors, future employees and consultants. 
The Company's 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2013 LTIP"), which was adopted by the Board on September 27, 2013, permits the issuance of up to one percent of the aggregate Common Shares outstanding (at the time of grant) to participants. 
Incentive awards that may be granted under the 2013 LTIP include restricted share units ("RSUs"), restricted Common Shares, incentive share options (on a limited basis), non-qualified share options, share appreciation rights, deferred share units, performance compensation awards, performance units, cash incentive awards and other equity-based and equity-related awards. 
As of December 31, 2018, there were 16,892 RSUs outstanding under the 2013 LTIP. The Compensation Committee intends to continue to provide each of its directors with an annual grant of RSUs with a grant-date fair value of approximately $25,000. The RSUs intended to be granted annually to the directors will be granted pursuant to the 2013 LTIP and will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant based on continuous service, payable in Common Shares at the time of vesting.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Our Named Executive Officers are not entitled to any payments upon termination of their service as executive officers of the Company or upon a change in control. 
However, the RSUs that were granted to Mr. McGuire and Mr. Del Col in respect of their service as members of our Board will vest in full if, upon a change in control or within twenty-four (24) months thereafter, the director's service as a member of our Board is terminated either (i) by the Company without cause or (ii) on account of death or disability. Any vesting or payments made in connection with such accelerated vesting will be assigned and paid directly to Sompo International pursuant to their letter agreements with Sompo International.

NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (THE "SAY-ON-PAY VOTE") 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which Congress adopted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, this proposal gives you as a Shareholder the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our pay program for named executive officers by voting for or against the compensation as set forth in this proxy statement. 
As described in detail earlier in this proxy statement under the heading "Executive Compensation," none of our Named Executive Officers receives any compensation directly from the Company in exchange for their services as executive officers, and the compensation paid to each of them in respect of their services as executive officers is determined and paid by Sompo International. 
We are asking our Shareholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our Shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.  PROPOSAL 3 
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO SELECT THE FREQUENCY OF THE SAY-ON-PAY VOTE 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which Congress adopted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Company is required to obtain a shareholder advisory vote as to how often we should include a proposal similar to Proposal 2 in this Proxy Statement, asking for a non-binding advisory vote approving the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. Therefore, we are asking Shareholders to express their preference as to whether the Company should include an advisory vote approving the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every year, every two years or every three years. Shareholders may also, if they wish, abstain from casting a vote on this proposal. In considering their vote, Shareholders may wish to carefully review the information presented in connection with Proposal 2 the information regarding the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed under "Executive Compensation" of this Proxy Statement. While the Board intends to carefully consider the Shareholder vote resulting from this proposal, this is an advisory vote that will not be binding on the Board. 
After careful consideration of the frequency alternatives, the Board recommends that you vote to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year. Holding an annual advisory vote on executive compensation will provide the Company with more direct and immediate shareholder feedback on the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE OPTION OF "ONE YEAR" AS THE FUTURE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE PROVIDED AN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  PROPOSAL 4 
APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
On February 21, 2019, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board unanimously selected, subject to approval of Shareholders, Ernst & Young Ltd., an independent registered public accounting firm, to continue to serve as the independent auditor of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019. In addition to this appointment, Shareholders are being asked to authorize the Board, acting by the Company's Audit Committee, to set the remuneration for Ernst & Young Ltd. for the year ending December 31, 2019.

A representative of Ernst & Young Ltd. is expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make statements and to respond to appropriate questions. 
Professional Fees Billed to the Company 
The following table presents fees billed for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young Ltd. during 2018 and 2017. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provisions of total services by Ernst & Young Ltd. are compatible with maintaining its independence with respect to the Company.

CATEGORICAL STANDARDS FOR DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
I.  Introduction  
[END TABLE]
For a director to be considered "independent" under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), must determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). These Standards have been established in order to assist the Board in determining director independence with broad consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances and may be amended by the Board from time to time. These standards shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the NYSE rules. 
In order to be considered independent, a director of the Company must meet all of the following Categorical Standards for Director Independence. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
II.  Definitions  
[END TABLE]
References to the "Company" include any parent or subsidiary in a consolidated group with the Company. 
The term "executive officer" has the same meaning specified for the term "officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
An "immediate family member" includes a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers and fathers-in- law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares such person's home. When applying the look-back provisions required herein, individuals who are no longer immediate family members as a result of legal separation or divorce, or those who have died or become incapacitated, need not be considered. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
III.  Employment Relationships  
[END TABLE]
(1) A director is not independent if the director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of the Company, or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of the Company. Employment as an interim Executive Chairman or CEO or other executive officer shall not disqualify a director from being considered independent following that employment. 
(2) A director is not independent if: (A) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that is the Company's internal or external auditor; (B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who participates in the firm's audit, assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years (but is no longer) a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the Company's audit within that time. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
IV.  Compensation Relationships  
[END TABLE]
(1) A director is not independent if the director has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years, any direct compensation from the Company, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service). Compensation received by a director for former service as an interim Executive Chairman or CEO or other executive officer need not be considered in determining independence under this test. 
(2) A director is not independent if the director has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years, any direct compensation from the Company, other than director 
A-1 
and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service). Compensation received by an immediate family member for service as an employee of the Company (other than as an executive officer) need not be considered in determining independence under this test. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
V.  Commercial and Charitable Relationships  
[END TABLE]
(1) A director is not independent if the director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds or exceeded the greater of $1 million or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues as reported for its last completed fiscal year. 
(2) A director is not independent if the director is an executive officer, director or trustee of a charitable organization that received contributions from the Company in an amount which, in any single fiscal year within the preceding three years, exceeded the greater of $1 million or 2% of such charitable organization's total charitable receipts as reported for the last completed fiscal year; provided, however, that the Board may determine such relationships to be immaterial or nevertheless consistent with a director's independence. Note that the Company's automatic matching of employee charitable contributions will not be included in the amount of the Company's contributions for the purposes of this paragraph. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
VI.  Interlocking Directorates  
[END TABLE]
A director is not independent if the director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
VII.  Other Relationships  
[END TABLE]
(1) Being a director, executive officer or employee, or having an immediate family member who is a director, executive officer or employee, of a company that purchases insurance, reinsurance or other services or products from the Company, by itself, does not bar a determination that the director is independent if the payments made to the Company for such products or services are made in the ordinary course of business on an arms-length basis. 
(2) For relationships not specifically mentioned above, the determination of whether a director has a material relationship with the Company (directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company), and therefore would not be independent, will be made by the Board after taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. For purposes of these standards, a director who is solely a director and/or a non-controlling shareholder of another company that has a relationship with the Company will not be considered to have a material relationship based solely on such relationship that would impair such director's independence. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
VIII.  Additional Standards for the Audit Committee  
[END TABLE]
In order to be considered independent as a member of the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee"), a director of the Company must meet the following additional requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
(1) A director is not independent for the purposes of Audit Committee membership if the director receives, whether directly or indirectly, any consulting or advisory fees or other compensation from the Company, other than director and committee fees, fixed payments under a retirement plan for prior service with the Company or 
A-2 
payments received as a shareholder of the Company. A member of the Audit Committee is considered to receive indirect compensation if: (A) the director is a partner, executive officer or holder of a similar position with an accounting firm, consulting firm, law firm or investment bank that receives payments for its services from the Company; or (B) the director's spouse, child or stepchild receives any form of compensation from the Company. 
(2) A director is not independent for the purposes of Audit Committee membership if the director is an affiliate of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company. The SEC defines an affiliate as a person who directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company. A director may qualify for the SEC safe harbor from being considered an affiliate if the director owns less than 10% of any class of the Company's voting securities and is not an executive officer of the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
IX.  Additional Standards for the Compensation and Nominating Committee  
[END TABLE]
In order for a director to be considered independent as a member of the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board (the "Compensation and Nominating Committee"), the following factors, among other relevant factors, must be considered as required by the SEC. 
(1) In determining a director's independence for the purposes of the Compensation and Nominating Committee, the source of compensation of the director should be considered, such as any consulting advisory or other fees paid by the Company to the director. 
(2) In determining a director's independence for the purposes of the Compensation and Nominating Committee, whether the director is an affiliate of the Company, or any the Company's subsidiaries or affiliates, should be considered.
