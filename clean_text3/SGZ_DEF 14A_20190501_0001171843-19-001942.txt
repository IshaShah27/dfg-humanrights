PROXY STATEMENT
FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  TO BE HELD WEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 2019
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SELECTIVE'S ANNUAL MEETING
WHEN AND WHERE IS THE ANNUAL MEETING?
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Selective Insurance Group, Inc. ("Selective" or "we") will be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time in the auditorium at Selective's principal offices at 40 Wantage Avenue, Branchville, New Jersey 07890. Directions to the Annual Meeting are on the back of this Proxy Statement. Our telephone number is (973) 948-3000.
WHEN IS THIS PROXY STATEMENT BEING MAILED?
This Proxy Statement and proxy card are first being mailed or given to Selective stockholders on March 25, 2019.
WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?
Anyone who owned Selective common stock as of the close of business on March 7, 2019, is entitled to one vote per share owned. There were 59,222,847 shares outstanding at the close of business on that date.
WHO IS SOLICITING MY PROXY TO VOTE MY SHARES AND WHEN?
Selective's Board of Directors ("Board of Directors" or the "Board") is soliciting your proxy, meaning your authorization for our named proxies, Thomas A. McCarthy and Michael J. Morrissey, to vote your shares.
Unless revoked by you, your proxy will be effective for the Annual Meeting and for any adjournments or postponements of that meeting.
WHAT IS THE COST OF SOLICITING PROXIES AND WHO IS PAYING FOR THE COST?
Selective is bearing the entire cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies will be solicited principally through the mail, but they also may be solicited personally or in writing, by telephone, e-mail, facsimile, or otherwise by Selective directors or officers, or employees of a Selective subsidiary, who will receive no additional compensation. Selective has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies and the distribution of proxy materials. Innisfree M&A Incorporated will provide such services for an estimated fee of approximately $15,000, plus expenses. Selective will reimburse banks, brokerage firms, and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to their customers or principals who are the beneficial owners of shares of Selective common stock.
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS TO BE CONDUCTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?
For business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting, owners of 29,611,425 shares of Selective common stock (a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote), constituting a quorum, must be in attendance or represented by proxy. Our common stock is our only class of voting securities.

PROPOSALS FOR STOCKHOLDER VOTE AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
Management is presenting three proposals for a stockholder vote.
THE BOARD IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL ELECTION BY THE STOCKHOLDERS. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE FOLLOWING 14 NOMINATED DIRECTORS FOR A TERM OF ONE YEAR:
You can find information about these nominees, Selective's Board of Directors, its committees, and other related matters in the section entitled, "Information about Proposal 1" of this Proxy Statement.
New Jersey law and Selective's By-Laws govern the vote on Proposal 1, on which you may:
Under our By-Laws and assuming a quorum is present, a director nominee in an uncontested election must be elected by a majority of votes cast. A majority exists when the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "against" the director nominee. A director nominee who fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election is required to tender his or her resignation from the Board of Directors within five days following the certification of the election results. In that event: (i) the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee must recommend to the Board of Directors whether it should accept the resignation; and (ii) the Board of Directors must decide whether to accept the resignation and disclose its decision-making process.
Stockholders may not cumulate their votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes (shares held by a broker, bank, or other nominee that does not have authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter) will not be taken into account in determining the outcome of the vote consistent with New Jersey law and the proxy rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Page  
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE 2018 COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
You can find information about the compensation of our named executive officers in the section entitled, "Executive Compensation" and about Proposal 2 in the section entitled, "Information about Proposal 2" of this Proxy Statement.
New Jersey law and Selective's By-Laws govern the vote on Proposal 2, on which you may:
Assuming a quorum is present, Proposal 2 will pass if approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal has received the requisite number of affirmative votes consistent with New Jersey law and the SEC's proxy rules.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.
You can find information about Selective's relationship with KPMG LLP in the section entitled, "Information about Proposal 3" of this Proxy Statement.
New Jersey law and Selective's By-Laws govern the vote on Proposal 3, on which you may:
Assuming a quorum is present, Proposal 3 will pass if it receives an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal has received the requisite number of affirmative votes consistent with New Jersey law and the SEC's proxy rules.
OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE ANNUAL MEETING
The Board of Directors is unaware of any other business to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly presented for a vote, the individuals named as proxies will have discretionary authority to vote on such matters according to their best judgment to the extent permitted by applicable law and Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") and SEC rules and regulations.
The Chairman of the Annual Meeting may refuse to allow the presentation of a proposal or nominee for the Board of Directors if the proposal or nominee is not properly submitted. The requirements for submitting proposals and nominations for this year's Annual Meeting are detailed in Selective's By-Laws.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This Proxy Statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like "anticipate," "expect," "project," "believe," "plan," "may," "estimate," "intend," and other similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and estimates using information available to us at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements in this Proxy Statement can be found in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q we have filed or will file with the SEC hereafter under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements."
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. This cautionary statement applies to all forward-looking statements contained in this document.
VOTING AND PROXY PROCEDURE
HOW DO I VOTE?
You can vote four ways:
Timing is important, so please mail your proxy card promptly. We must receive it before the beginning of the Annual Meeting. If you do not give voting instructions on your signed and mailed proxy card, the named proxies will vote your shares FOR each of the director nominees, and FOR Proposals 2 and 3. If any other matters requiring a vote arise during the meeting, the named proxies will exercise their discretion using their best judgment to the extent permitted by applicable law and Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations.
Page 4
HOW DO I REVOKE MY PROXY OR CHANGE MY VOTING INSTRUCTIONS?
You may revoke your proxy at any time before the proxy is exercised at the Annual Meeting by:
HOW WILL PROXIES BE VOTED IF I GIVE MY AUTHORIZATION?
If you: (i) properly execute your proxy card and return it to Selective; or (ii) submit your proxy by telephone or via the Internet, and do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your shares of common stock will be voted at the Annual Meeting according to your instructions.
In the absence of voting instructions, the named proxies will vote your shares FOR each of the director nominees and FOR Proposals 2 and 3. If other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the named proxies will vote on such matters using their best judgment to the extent permitted by applicable law and Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations.
WHAT IF MY SHARES ARE NOT REGISTERED IN MY NAME?
If you are a beneficial owner of our stock, meaning that the Selective stock you own is held in the name of a bank, broker, or other nominee (commonly referred to as holding shares in "street name"), you should have received access to these proxy materials from your bank, broker, or other nominee by mail or e-mail with information on how to submit your voting instructions. Unless you provide voting instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on the election of directors (Proposal 1); and the advisory (non-binding) vote on the 2018 compensation of Selective's named executive officers (Proposal 2). In contrast, brokers may, at their discretion, vote uninstructed shares on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3), which is a "routine" proposal. Broker non-votes count toward a quorum, but otherwise do not affect the outcome of any proposal.
HOW WILL VOTES BE COUNTED?
The inspectors of election appointed for the Annual Meeting by the Board of Directors will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions, and broker non-votes. Shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for determining whether there is a quorum.
For Proposal 1, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered in determining whether director nominees have received more "for" votes than "against" votes. Approval of Proposal 2 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes do not affect Proposal 2. Approval of Proposal 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions do not affect Proposal 3.
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 2019
This Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders are available on  Selective's Internet website at www.Selective.com.

INFORMATION ABOUT PROPOSAL 1
Election of Directors
Under our By-Laws, directors in uncontested elections must be elected by a majority of votes cast. A majority exists when the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. For more information on our majority voting policy, please see the section entitled, "Corporate Governance – Majority Voting for Directors in Uncontested Elections" of this Proxy Statement.
All directors stand for election for a one-year term. In all cases, each director will hold office until a successor has been elected and qualified, or until the director's earlier resignation or removal.
The Board of Directors currently has 14 members. Under Selective's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, Selective may have a minimum of seven and a maximum of 20 directors. By majority vote, the Board of Directors may set the number of directors within this range at any time.
Process for Review and Nomination of Director Candidates
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for the review and nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews all director candidates for possible nomination and election to the Board and seeks such candidates from any source, including:
Any stockholder proposing one or more Board candidates must submit in writing all applicable information required by Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the Company's By-Laws to the Chairperson of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, Selective Insurance Group, Inc., 40 Wantage Avenue, Branchville, New Jersey 07890.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates all candidates, including those recommended by stockholders, based on, among other things, the following standards:
Although Selective has no formal diversity policy, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the composition of the Board should encompass a broad range of skills, expertise, industry knowledge, and diversity of opinion. Accordingly, diversity of thought, experience, gender, race, and ethnic background are greatly considered in the director evaluation process.
Page 6
Director Nominees
No family relationships exist between any of Selective's current directors, executive officers, and persons nominated by Selective to become a director.
The Board ratified the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's nomination of the 14 directors listed below to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting for terms expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting or until a successor has been duly elected and qualified. Paul D. Bauer will be retiring at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
All 14 nominees have consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. The Board does not know any reason why any nominee would decline or be unable to serve if elected. If a nominee becomes unavailable or unable to serve before the Annual Meeting, the Board can reduce its size or designate a substitute nominee. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, proxies that would have been cast for the original nominee will be cast for the substitute nominee unless contrary instructions are given.

Director William M. Rue is Chairman, and owns more than 10%, of the equity of Rue Insurance, an independent insurance agency that has been appointed to do business on behalf of Selective's insurance subsidiaries since 1928. Mr. Rue has two children who are employed by Rue Insurance: a daughter; and a son, who also serves as president of the agency and owns more than 10% of the equity of Rue Insurance. The appointment of Rue Insurance as an independent agent was made on similar terms and conditions as other agents of Selective's insurance subsidiaries and includes the right to: (i) receive commissions for policies placed; and (ii) participate in the Amended and Restated Selective Insurance Group, Inc.

The Board of Directors of the Foundation is comprised of some of the officers of the Company and its insurance subsidiaries. We made $0.5 million of contributions to the Foundation in 2018.

All transactions with Vanguard are consummated in the ordinary course of business on an arm's-length basis.
Review, Approval, or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
Selective has a written Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures (the "Related Person Policy").
The Related Person Policy defines "Related Person Transactions" as any transaction, arrangement, or relationship in which Selective or any of its subsidiaries was, is, or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $20,000, and in which any "Related Person" had, has, or will have a direct or indirect interest. A "Related Person" under the Related Person Policy is generally: (i) any director, executive officer, or nominee to become director of Selective or an immediate family member of such person; (ii) a beneficial owner of more than 5% of Selective's common stock or an immediate family member of such beneficial owner; and (iii) any firm, corporation, or other entity in which any person included in (i) or (ii) is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest in Selective's common stock.
Under the Related Person Policy, the Audit Committee (or Chairperson of the Audit Committee if between meetings) must approve Related Person Transactions. In its review, the Audit Committee considers all available relevant facts and circumstances of the proposed transaction, including: (i) the benefits to Selective; (ii) the impact on a director's independence; (iii) the availability of other sources for comparable products and services; (iv) the terms of the transaction; and (v) the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. No Audit Committee member may participate in any review, consideration, or approval of any Related Person Transaction in which such director or any of his or her immediate family members is the Related Person. The Audit Committee 
Page 16
only approves those Related Person Transactions that it considers are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of Selective and its stockholders.
Director Independence
The Board of Directors has determined that all directors and nominees for director are independent under Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations – other than Messrs. Marchioni, Murphy, and Rue[1]. In making its determination, the Board considered disclosures made by the directors related to various transactions, relationships, or arrangements involving Selective. Disclosures by the following four directors required analysis:
Terrance W. Cavanaugh: In determining that Mr. Cavanaugh is an independent director, the Board considered that a son of Mr. Cavanaugh is employed as a director and Insurance Company Industry Leader of the FINEX Global division of Willis Towers Watson ("WTW"), an organization with which our insurance subsidiaries and employee benefit plans have commercial relationships, although we have not engaged the services of the division for which Mr. Cavanaugh's son works.
Mr. Cavanaugh also has a daughter who is employed by Hyatt Hotels Corporation as an Event Management Associate. We have commercial relationships with various Hyatt branded entities. However, the Board has determined that these commercial relationships are not material principally because: (i) the payments made were substantially less than 2% of the consolidated gross revenues of WTW and Hyatt, respectively; and (ii) neither Mr. Cavanaugh's son nor daughter had any involvement with the transactions with WTW and Hyatt.
As: (i) neither Mr. Cavanaugh nor his son or daughter have any involvement in the above transactions; (ii) nearly the entire scope of our relationships with WTW and Hyatt pre-dates the commencement of Mr. Cavanaugh's service on our Board; and (iii) the amount of revenue generated for WTW and Hyatt through these arrangements is not material to WTW or Hyatt, the Board determined these arrangements do not affect Mr. Cavanaugh's independence.
Ronald L. O'Kelley: In determining that Mr. O'Kelley is an independent director, the Board considered that a daughter of Mr. O'Kelley is Vice President for Quality Improvement & Compliance with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty Mutual"), with which one of our insurance subsidiaries had a commercial relationship during 2018. However, the Board has determined that the commercial relationship is not material principally because: (i) the payments made between our subsidiary and Liberty Mutual were substantially less than 2% of the consolidated gross revenues of Liberty Mutual; and (ii) Mr. O'Kelley's daughter had no involvement with Selective's insurance program with Liberty Mutual.
Another daughter of Mr. O'Kelley is Managing Director of State Street Global Markets, LLC, a subsidiary of State Street Corporation ("State Street"), with which we have a commercial relationship. However, the Board determined that the commercial relationship is not material principally because: (i) the payments were substantially less than 2% of the consolidated gross revenues of State Street; and (ii) Mr. O'Kelley's daughter has no involvement with these transactions. Accordingly, the Board determined that these arrangements do not affect Mr. O'Kelley's independence.
John S. Scheid: In determining that Mr. Scheid is an independent director, the Board considered that we currently provide insurance coverage to the Messmer Catholic Schools ("Messmer"), a charitable organization of which Mr. Scheid has been a director since 2013 and chairman since 2016. We provide insurance coverage to Messmer on terms no more favorable than to other third parties. As: (i) Mr. Scheid has no involvement in the securing of such insurance policy coverage; (ii) his relationship with Messmer pre-dates his membership on our Board; and (iii) our business relationship with Messmer pre-dates Mr. Scheid's appointment to Selective's Board, the Board determined that this arrangement does not affect Mr. Scheid's independence.
_______________________________
1 For a description of the transactions, relationships, or arrangements related to Mr. Rue, see the section entitled, "Transactions with Related Persons."
Page 17
H. Elizabeth Mitchell: In determining that Ms. Mitchell is an independent director, the Board considered that Ms. Mitchell's husband retired in 2018 as Chief Risk and Actuarial Officer of Partner Re, a reinsurance organization with which our insurance subsidiaries have a commercial relationship. As: (i) neither Ms. Mitchell nor her husband have any involvement in the transactions with Partner Re entities; (ii) the transactions with such companies pre-date Ms. Mitchell's service on our Board; and (iii) the amount of revenue involved in such transactions is immaterial to the business of such entities, the Board determined these arrangements do not affect Ms. Mitchell's independence.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Selective's directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of Selective's equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership of Selective's equity securities. Directors, executive officers, and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish Selective with copies of all Section 16(a) Exchange Act reports they file. Based solely on Selective's review of the provided copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5, or written representations from certain reporting persons that Forms 5 were not required, Selective believes that all directors, executive officers, and greater than 10% beneficial owners timely met all reporting requirements under Section 16(a) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance Guidelines
Selective has established Corporate Governance Guidelines that are available for review in the Corporate Governance subsection of the Investors section of Selective's website, www.Selective.com. These guidelines provide for the election of a Lead Independent Director, who supervises meetings of Selective's independent directors that occur at least semi-annually. J. Brian Thebault is presently the Lead Independent Director. In 2018, Selective's independent directors met four times outside the presence of management.
All members of the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Salary and Employee Benefits Committee are independent directors under Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations.
Majority Voting for Directors in Uncontested Elections
Selective's Board of Directors has adopted a majority voting policy for uncontested elections of incumbent directors. To be re-elected to the Board, an incumbent director must receive a majority vote by stockholders, unless the Corporate Secretary determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. If any incumbent director nominee receives less than a majority of votes cast, the following process must be followed:
Page  
Stock Ownership and Retention Requirements and Hedging
Selective believes that stock ownership by directors and management encourages the enhancement of stockholder value. Selective's stock ownership guidelines, which are based on prevailing corporate governance practices, are included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available in the Corporate Governance subsection of the Investors section of www.Selective.com.
The following table shows the common stock ownership guidelines for our directors and certain officers. Each director must meet the guidelines within five years of his or her first election to the Board and each officer must meet, or have met, the guidelines on the later of March 31, 2015, or within six years of attaining the specified position:
In calculating ownership under the guidelines:
Officers are required to retain direct ownership of at least 75% of the shares acquired under an equity award granted under any Selective equity compensation plan or other written compensatory arrangements that pays out after July 27, 2011, net of taxes and transaction costs, unless the officer has met his or her applicable stock ownership requirement as set forth above. All of our directors and officers have met, or are on track to meet, the required ownership guidelines.
Selective officers, directors, and employees are prohibited from entering into hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, involving Selective common stock. These transactions would allow an officer, director, or employee to hold Selective securities without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the officer, director, or employee may no longer have the same objectives as Selective's other stockholders. For this reason, such hedging or monetization transactions are prohibited.

BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES
The Board of Directors held five meetings in 2018. All directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate of the meetings of the Board of Directors and their respective committees for the period during which they were directors in 2018. Selective expects all directors to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. All directors serving on the Board on May 2, 2018 attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
The Board has five standing committees:
The following tables provide information on each of the five committees:

RISK MANAGEMENT
Board Leadership Structure
Our two principal Board leadership positions are: (i) Chairman of the Board; and (ii) Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director position is defined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and is very similar to the role of an independent, non-executive Chairman. We believe our current Board leadership structure provides effective oversight of management and strong leadership of the independent directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also conducts annual self-assessments and evaluates their effectiveness of the Board and its committees.
The Lead Independent Director is responsible for coordinating the activities of the independent directors and performing various other duties. The Lead Independent Director's general authority and responsibilities are as follows:
Our Lead Independent Director is J. Brian Thebault, who was appointed in 2017 and has served on our Board since 1996. Our Chairman of the Board since 2000 has been Gregory E. Murphy, our CEO. At this time, we believe there is a benefit to having Mr. Murphy serve as both Chairman of the Board and CEO. As the executive with primary responsibility for managing our day-to-day operations, he is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings and to ensure that key business issues and risks are brought to the attention of our Board or its appropriate committee.
Enterprise Risk Management
As a property and casualty holding company, our insurance subsidiaries are in the business of assuming risk. We categorize our major risks into the following five broad categories:
Page 23
Our internal control framework operates with the three lines of defense model:
We use Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") as part of our governance and control process to take an entity-wide view of our major risks and their impact. Our ERM framework is designed to identify, measure, report, and monitor our major risks and develop appropriate responses to support successful execution of our business strategy.
Our Board oversees our ERM process, while the Executive Risk Committee is responsible for the holistic evaluation, management, and supervision of our aggregated risk profile and determination of future risk management actions in support of overall risk appetite. In addition to the Board's oversight of the ERM process, various committees of the Board oversee risks specific to their areas of supervision and report their activities and findings to the full Board. The Executive Risk Committee uses various management committees for detailed analysis and management of specific major risks. The Executive Risk Committee primarily consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, their direct reports and key operational leaders, each of whom is responsible for management of risk in his or her respective area, and the Chief Risk Officer. 
In addition to the various committees and the governance process over the ERM process, we believe that high-quality and effective ERM is best achieved when it is a shared cultural value throughout the organization. We consider ERM to be a key process that is the responsibility of every employee. We have developed and use tools and processes that we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. In addition, our compensation policies and practices, as well as our governance framework, including our Board's leadership structure, are designed to support our overall risk appetite and strategy. We believe that our ERM processes and practices help us to identify potential events that may affect us, quantify, evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed, and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives.
We rely on quantitative and qualitative tools to identify, prioritize, and manage our major risks including proprietary and third-party computer modeling as well as various other analyses. The Executive Risk Committee meets at least quarterly and reviews and discusses various aspects and the interrelation of Selective's major risks, including, but not limited to, capital modeling results, capital adequacy, risk metrics, emerging risks, and sensitivity analysis. Consistent with the requirements of state insurance regulators, our insurance subsidiaries annually file their Own Risk and Solvency Assessment report, which is an internal assessment of our insurance subsidiaries' solvency. The Chief Risk Officer develops the report in coordination with members of the Executive Risk Committee, and the report is provided to the Board. The Chief Risk Officer reports on the Executive Risk Committee's activities, analyses, and findings to the Board or the appropriate Board committee, and provides a quarterly update on certain risk metrics.

Compensation Risk Assessment
We do not believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or results. To make this determination, we conducted an internal risk assessment of our compensation policies and programs. In performing the risk assessment, we considered that we operate in an industry based almost entirely on managing risk, and we believe that our risk management function is robust. We also analyzed the issues detailed in the proxy disclosure rules and gave close consideration to the following points:
We also considered our overall compensation program, including:
We also considered that, from time to time, we adjust our compensation programs as risks in our industry and reportable segments change to help ensure that compensation and risk remain appropriately aligned.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides our stockholders information about our 2018 compensation program for the following named executive officers ("NEOs"):
Since January 1, 2017, as designated by the Board of Directors, Messrs. Murphy, Wilcox, Marchioni, and Lanza have been Selective's only "executive officers" under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Consideration of 2018 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote Results
Since our initial say-on-pay proposal in 2011, our stockholders have overwhelmingly supported our compensation decisions. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders voted on an advisory basis to approve the compensation of our NEOs, with over 97% of votes cast voting in favor of the proposal. We considered these results and, in light of our stockholders' indicated support for our compensation decisions, did not make any material changes in our 2018 compensation decisions and policies. We have continued to maintain our emphasis on providing a combination of both short-term and long-term incentive compensation, which we believe rewards our executives for delivering stockholder value.
Page 26
2018 Corporate Performance Highlights
During 2018, we continued to make excellent progress executing our Strategic Business Plan Framework that focuses on our five strategic imperatives:
For 2018, we generated a GAAP return on equity of 10.2% and a non-GAAP operating return on equity[3] ("ROE") of 12.5%, which was: (i) above our budgeted projection for the year; and (ii) above Conning, Inc.'s expected 2018 U.S. property and casualty insurance industry GAAP return on equity of 7.2%. We also produced an impressive combined ratio of 95.0%, which compares very favorably to Conning, Inc.'s expected 2018 U.S. property and casualty insurance industry combined ratio of 99.4%.
GAAP COMBINED RATIO
_____________________________
3 Non-GAAP operating return on equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as follows:
Operating income differs from net income by the exclusion of after-tax net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and the deferred tax asset charge that was recognized in 2017 in relation to tax reform. It is used as an important financial measure by management, analysts, and investors, because the realization of investment gains and losses on sales in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing. These investment gains and losses, other-than-temporary investment impairments that are charged to earnings, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, and the deferred tax write-off, could distort the analysis of trends. Operating return on equity is not intended as a substitute for return on equity that is based on net income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Page 27
In addition to our excellent combined ratio and non-GAAP operating ROE, other key accomplishments for 2018 included the following:
In the fourth quarter of 2018, A.M. Best Company reaffirmed our "A (Excellent)" (with a "stable" outlook) financial strength rating, citing our strong balance sheet, sustained profitability, favorable business profile, and appropriate enterprise risk management. During the fourth quarter of 2018, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed our financial strength rating of "A" (with a "stable" outlook), citing our improved operating performance in standard lines supported by sophisticated underwriting tools, a strong network of independent agents, and strong capital adequacy. Fitch Ratings reaffirmed our "A+" rating (with a "stable" outlook) in the second quarter of 2018, citing our strong underwriting results, solid capitalization with growth in stockholders' equity, strong business profile, and stable interest coverage metrics. Moody's Investors Service's reaffirmed our "A2" rating (with a "stable" outlook) in the first quarter of 2018, referencing our solid regional franchise, established independent agency support, solid risk-adjusted capitalization, strong invested asset quality, and good underwriting profitability.
CEO Pay for Performance
The following table presents Mr. Murphy's compensation over the past five years, its dollar and percentage change from the prior year, and Selective's TSR for the one-, three-, and five-year periods. We believe the table demonstrates the correlation between changes in Selective's TSR and Mr. Murphy's compensation, which is consistent with, and reflects our philosophy of, aligning compensation with the interests of stockholders and long-term performance.

* Note: The value of "Indexed Total Shareholder Return (TSR)" at each year-end shown above is based on the then-current value of an assumed $100 investment in Selective stock on December 31, 2013, and reflects changes in stock price and assumes that dividends paid to stockholders are reinvested in Selective stock.
*For 2017, also includes discretionary bonus.
Role and Function of the Salary and Employee Benefits Committee
The Salary and Employee Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors ("SEBC") oversees executive compensation. The SEBC retains an independent executive compensation consultant, Exequity LLP ("Compensation Consultant"), to advise it on executive and director compensation issues. Compensation Consultant representatives: (i) review senior executive compensation; (ii) prepare comprehensive competitive compensation analyses for our NEOs; (iii) provide counsel to the SEBC regarding award metrics, components of compensation, amounts allocated to those components, and the total compensation opportunities for the CEO and the other NEOs; and (iv) attend SEBC meetings, as requested by the SEBC.
The Compensation Consultant has advised the SEBC since 2007. The Compensation Consultant does not provide any services to Selective other than to advise the SEBC on executive and director compensation matters. Based on applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules, the SEBC has determined that the Compensation Consultant's services do not raise a conflict of interest.
Page The SEBC has full autonomy in determining executive compensation and makes all final determinations about CEO and other NEO compensation, incorporating information provided by the Compensation Consultant. The CEO makes compensation recommendations to the SEBC for the President and Chief Operating Officer based on the CEO's assessment of the President and Chief Operating Officer's annual performance, contributions to Selective, and potential for advancement. The CEO and President and Chief Operating Officer make compensation recommendations to the SEBC for the other NEOs based on their assessment of the other NEOs' annual performance, contributions to Selective, and potential for advancement. In making its compensation decisions, the SEBC also considers pre-established guidelines regarding award amounts and pay levels at companies with which we compete for business and executive talent (discussed below), Selective's performance, executive retention issues, internal compensation parity, and advancement in abilities, experience, and responsibilities. The Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer and certain other human resources officers, as part of their usual duties and responsibilities, provide the SEBC with information regarding the overall design of the executive compensation program and its individual components.
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF SELECTIVE'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Selective's Executive Compensation Program Objective and Philosophy
The objective of our executive compensation program is to attract, retain, and motivate executive talent who will drive the organization's success by creating stockholder value through profitable growth and effective risk management.
Our compensation program is designed to: (i) reward the achievement of our business objectives through the execution of our Strategic Business Plan Framework and its five strategic imperatives; (ii) recognize our executives for their individual achievements by motivating them to execute their duties and responsibilities in a manner not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or results; and (iii) promote and align both short- and long-term interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. We aim to provide these highly talented and qualified executives with compensation that is competitive, both in value and mix of short-term and long-term cash and stock-based components, with the total compensation paid by other property and casualty insurance companies and other companies with which we compete for executive talent.
Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, we link our annual incentive awards to pre-determined financial and strategic business objectives and individual contributions, and we align our long-term compensation to the achievement of pre-determined specific performance measures that impact the generation of long-term stockholder value.
Compensation Elements
Our executive compensation program generally consists of the following key elements selected to: (i) address the market-based realities of attracting and retaining quality executives; and (ii) align the executives' compensation with our stockholders' interests:
Page Compensation Best Practices
Selective primarily uses the following compensation structures and practices:
Benchmarking
When making compensation decisions, the SEBC believes it is important to be informed of compensation practices at multiple comparator groups of publicly-traded companies and property and casualty insurance holding companies. The SEBC believes that:
Accordingly, the SEBC received from, and reviewed with, the Compensation Consultant the following benchmarking information in late 2017 for purposes of establishing 2018 compensation:
As part of the 2018 compensation process, in late 2017, the Compensation Consultant furnished the SEBC with the most recent NEO compensation information available from the following:

To re-evaluate its earlier 2018 NEO compensation decisions and in establishing compensation parameters for 2019, the SEBC reviewed the most recent NEO compensation information available as of that time from these two market reference sources in late 2018 and early 2019. OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. was acquired in September 2017 and the SEBC determined that it was appropriate to replace OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. with Erie Indemnity Company in the Proxy Peers.
Information for the Proxy Peers in the above table (collectively, the "Proxy Peer Group") was obtained from proxy statements and other materials filed with the SEC. This information includes data on compensation components and comparative analyses of the overall financial performance of the Proxy Peer Group. The Proxy Peer Group is composed of organizations that provide similar products, have a similar geographic market scope, and compete with us for executive talent. The Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Survey provides supplemental data from organizations of various sizes. Because we strive to engage the best talent and may have to recruit from larger organizations, we look at data from throughout the property and casualty insurance industry. In late 2018 and early 2019, the SEBC reviewed information reported in the Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Survey, which reflects data from 53 organizations, including Selective, that have an annual median direct written premium of $3.4 billion and annual median revenues of $3.2 billion.
When the SEBC evaluates the compensation we pay to our NEOs, it seeks to benchmark against positions with comparable job responsibilities whenever possible. Mr. Marchioni's position, which has broad succession plan-mandated responsibilities, does not have a direct comparator in our multiple market reference groups. The lack of a true benchmark position for Mr. Marchioni impacts the compensation comparison of our NEOs as a group. Relative 2018 total NEO compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was 62% above the aggregate average median, and 16% below the aggregate average 75th percentile, of the reference market sources, which the SEBC deemed appropriate given Selective's corporate performance and the individual performance of our NEOs, and particularly the performance of Mr. Marchioni, for whom there is not an appropriate comparator within the benchmarks. The components comprising total compensation differed from market to varying degrees. Specifically, base salary was above the total average median by 12% and annual cash incentive awards were 130% above the total average median, resulting in annual total cash compensation that was above the total average median by 82%. The grant date fair value of our 2018 long-term incentive awards was 30% above the total average median. Considering each individual's accomplishments and contributions, the degree to which we achieved our 2018 goals and significantly outperformed relative to the expected industry performance, the SEBC felt that each NEO's compensation was appropriate.
2018 ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION AND ALLOCATION BETWEEN CURRENT AND LONG-TERM COMPENSATION
The table below shows the percentage of total variable and total fixed compensation for the CEO and the other NEOs that is short-term incentive compensation (ACIP) versus long-term incentive compensation (LTIP), and fixed compensation (base salary) versus variable compensation (ACIP and LTIP). When evaluating 2018 compensation for our CEO and other NEOs, the SEBC considered: (i) our overall results compared to budget and projected industry results; (ii) our ability to obtain renewal pure price increases on our insurance business that allowed us to produce a strong combined ratio; (iii) our ability to profitably grow NPW; (iv) our investment income performance compared to both budget and benchmark targets; (v) significant claims improvement initiatives; and (vi) retention of top talent. These factors were viewed in light of the relative competitive positioning of the compensation of our CEO and the other NEOs.
Page As the table indicates, the 2018 compensation allocation aligns closely with our compensation philosophy, which is designed to motivate executives to achieve short-term and long-term corporate objectives consistent with our stockholders' economic interests. We strive to achieve a balance between pay incentive vehicles and performance time horizons.
The charts below reflect the allocation of 2018 compensation to LTIP, ACIP, and base salary for the CEO and for all other NEOs on average:
Base Salary
Our base salary compensation is intended to provide stable, competitive compensation while taking into account each executive's scope of responsibility, relevant background, training, and experience. In setting base salaries, the SEBC considers both competitive market data for positions with comparable job content and overall market demand for each position. The SEBC generally believes that base salaries should be aligned with market trends for executives with similar responsibilities at comparable companies. When establishing the base salaries of NEOs, the SEBC also considers:
Based on these considerations, the position of each NEO's salary to competitive data, and the desire to contain fixed costs in support of expense ratio initiatives, none of our NEOs received a base salary increase in 2018.
Page Annual Cash Incentive Program (ACIP)
Our ACIP is intended to link a meaningful portion of annual cash compensation to one or more pre-established near-term strategic and/or financial organizational performance goals. For 2018, all NEOs were eligible to participate in the ACIP. ACIP awards are granted under the Selective Insurance Group, Inc. Cash Incentive Plan, As Amended and Restated as of May 1, 2014 (the "Cash Incentive Plan"). ACIP awards made to our NEOs for 2017 and prior years were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. For more information regarding the application of Section 162(m) to the executive compensation program for our NEOs, see the section below entitled, "Tax Treatment and Accounting."
2018 Corporate ACIP Measures
Our Corporate ACIP Measures are established to encourage our employees to remain focused on particular financial and strategic objectives, even in the face of especially challenging circumstances in a performance year. For 2018, the SEBC determined that for each NEO, his respective Corporate ACIP funding opportunity would be between 0% and 143.5% of each NEO's maximum ACIP opportunity (expressed as a percentage of salary), and based on attainment of the Corporate ACIP Measures, which consisted of financial and strategic initiative measures.
As shown below, 0% to 88.5% of the maximum ACIP opportunity was based on a financial performance goal of achieving a GAAP combined ratio of between 89.0% and 100.5%, and 0% to 55% of the maximum ACIP opportunity was based on the achievement of 15 measures related to our five strategic imperatives. The table below shows total potential Corporate ACIP payouts at various combined ratio percentages, assuming all 15 measures were fully met:
2018 Corporate ACIP Measure Results
The 2018 Corporate ACIP Measure results were based on our achievement of the financial metric of overall GAAP combined ratio and the strategic measures, as described in greater detail below.
Financial Performance Results
For 2018, our overall GAAP combined ratio was 95.0%. Accordingly, the financial performance component of the Corporate ACIP Measures generated funding at 42.3%. 
Page Strategic Measures Performance Results
As reflected in the table below, we fully achieved 13 measures, partially achieved one measure, and did not achieve one measure of the 15 total 2018 ACIP strategic measures, which support our five strategic imperatives. Accordingly, the strategic measures performance component of the Corporate ACIP Measures generated funding at 47.5%.

Page 2018 Corporate ACIP Measure Results
For 2018, our combined Corporate ACIP Measures resulted in total funding opportunity for the NEOs of 89.8%.
2018 ACIP Payment Opportunities and Awards for NEOs
The 2018 ACIP payment opportunities for the NEOs were based on competitive market levels and set as a percentage of annual base salary. The following table lists each NEO's 2018 minimum and maximum ACIP opportunities, the SEBC's actual 2018 award as a percentage of base salary, and the change in ACIP from 2017 to 2018:
ELEMENTS OF LONG-TERM COMPENSATION
Design Elements
Our long-term incentive opportunities are intended to reward our leaders and encourage their long-term retention. By aligning financial rewards with the economic interests of our stockholders, leaders are motivated to achieve our long-term strategic objectives and increase stockholder value. We use both cash and non-cash vehicles under our LTIP to deliver long-term compensation, which is consistent with the market practices of the companies included in our Proxy Peer Group. We establish a dollar-denominated target for each employee eligible to participate in the LTIP, including the NEOs. All individual target award amounts are aggregated to determine the total LTIP award pool.
LTIP awards are granted in overlapping three-year cycles and are allocated among performance-based restricted stock units and performance-based cash incentive units. By granting performance-based restricted stock units and performance-based cash incentive units with three-year performance periods, our goal is to encourage executive officers to continue their tenure with us and align their economic interests with those of our stockholders.
Long-Term Incentive Program Award Grants 
Performance goals for the long-term incentive awards granted in 2016 through 2018 are as follows:
(1) Statutory operating return on policyholder surplus is a measurement of profitability that reflects the amount of statutory operating income generated by dividing statutory operating income by the average policyholder surplus during the period.
Page In determining the amount of LTIP awards granted to the NEOs in 2018, the SEBC considered several factors, including: (i) each NEO's performance during the previous year, including the achievement of departmental goals and other projects and endeavors accomplished throughout the year, as outlined below; (ii) each NEO's total compensation in comparison to our Proxy Peer Group and Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Survey data; and (iii) our desire for long-term retention of high-performing executives.
In 2017, the SEBC changed the elements allocation of the total grant date fair value of LTIP awards to executives, including the NEOs. The SEBC increased the allocation to performance-based restricted stock units, and lowered and narrowed the performance grid for performance-based cash incentive units, to mitigate the potential volatility of stock compensation expense. The 2018 and 2017 LTIP awards' allocation are 75% performance-based restricted stock units and 25% performance-based cash incentive units.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the total grant date fair value of each NEO's LTIP award made in 2018 consisted of performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Selective Insurance Group, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Stock Plan (the "Omnibus Stock Plan"), based on, and subject to, the following conditions:
Dividend equivalent units ("DEUs") are credited on performance-based restricted stock units at the same time and same dividend rate paid to all Selective stockholders. Payment of DEUs, which are payable in shares of Selective common stock, remains subject to the same vesting conditions and performance measures as the underlying restricted stock units. DEUs are not paid out unless and until the related restricted stock units vest. This use of performance-based restricted stock units aligns this component of our NEOs' compensation with overall corporate performance and stockholder interests.
Performance-Based Cash Incentive Units
The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the grant date fair value of the NEO's LTIP award granted in 2018 consisted of performance-based cash incentive units granted under the Cash Incentive Plan, based on, and subject to, the following terms:
Page  
In establishing the peer group (the "Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group") for 2018 to compare performance and determine the ultimate number of performance-based cash incentive units earned, the SEBC strived to include companies that have a similar mix of products, operate in the same geographic regions, have similar premium volume, and distribute their products through independent agents. The Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group differs from the Proxy Peer Group, as the Proxy Peer Group also includes companies with which we compete for executive talent. The Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group consists of the following companies:

[END TABLE]
Page (2) Cash incentive unit awards are denominated in units with an initial value of $100. For 2015 awards, appreciation or depreciation was based on TSR, which is determined using the change in Selective's common stock price and reinvested dividends over the three-year performance period for the award. The number of 2015 units ultimately earned was based on: (i) cumulative three-year statutory NPW growth relative to the Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group index; and (ii) cumulative three-year operating return on policyholder surplus relative to this peer group index.
(3) Performance results exceeded the maximum levels; 200% was the maximum payout for the 2015 Cash Incentive Units.
2018 COMPENSATION ACTIONS FOR THE CEO AND OTHER NEOS
In making its 2018 base salary, ACIP, and LTIP compensation decisions for our CEO and the other NEOs, the SEBC considered each NEO's overall and individual accomplishments and contributions. The required achievement of pre-determined financial and strategic goals limits the ACIP and LTIP components of our compensation program. We structure our reward programs to retain and motivate our best-performing employees and those in critical positions. In balancing our strategic results achieved with ongoing price competition, the SEBC made the following compensation decisions for 2018:
As CEO, Mr. Murphy has ultimate responsibility for the achievement of all financial, strategic, and investment goals. In making its compensation decisions for Mr. Murphy, the SEBC considered our overall corporate performance, as previously detailed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section entitled "2018 Corporate Performance Highlights," and a comprehensive written performance appraisal completed by non-employee members of Selective's Board of Directors.
Based on the degree of achievement of the Corporate ACIP measures and the factors noted above in the 2018 Corporate Performance Highlights, the SEBC determined that Mr. Murphy's 2018 ACIP would be set at 226% of base salary. The SEBC also considered Mr. Murphy's long-standing superior leadership in achieving exceptional and sustained financial and operating performance, and the historical positioning of his compensation relative to peers, which has ranged from below the peer median, to modestly above the peer median, even during periods of outstanding performance.
The SEBC determined that Mr. Murphy's ACIP payment was appropriate and consistent with Selective's pay-for-performance philosophy and that it reinforces our long history of linking pay and performance.
Our other NEOs were also critical in executing Selective's 2018 strategic goals and key accomplishments. In light of these accomplishments, the SEBC made the following compensation decisions for the other NEOs:
Page In making compensation decisions regarding base salary and LTIP for the other NEOs, the SEBC considered the following for each NEO:
Mr. Wilcox – In addition to his general management responsibility as a member of the executive management team, Mr. Wilcox, as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has primary responsibility for all financial matters, including financial accounting, investor relations, tax, capital and capital management planning, treasury, billing, investment operations, enterprise risk management, reinsurance, and contracts and procurement. Mr. Wilcox's major contributions in 2018 included:
Based on the degree of achievement of the Corporate ACIP Measures and the factors noted above, the SEBC approved the CEO's recommendation that Mr. Wilcox's 2018 ACIP payment be set at 154% of his base salary. This compares to his initial ACIP payment opportunity range of 0-200% of base salary.
Page Mr. Wilcox's ACIP payment for 2018 was 3% higher than his 2017 ACIP. We believe his 2018 ACIP award aligns with our pay-for-performance philosophy that is intended to reward and retain key performers in critical positions.
Mr. Marchioni – As President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Marchioni has been responsible for our Insurance Operations, Strategy, Actuarial, Human Resources, Marketing, and Information Technology areas. Mr. Marchioni plays a key role in developing strategies that enhance profitability, growth, and competitive strength, including managing agency relations, claims, underwriting, customer service, and all regional operations. In 2018, Mr. Marchioni also assumed direct reporting responsibility for Messrs. Wilcox and Lanza, as well as oversight for their respective areas of responsibility, consistent with our focus on leadership development. Mr. Marchioni also serves as a member of our key management committees.
Mr. Marchioni has primary responsibilities for the achievement of the 2018 Corporate ACIP strategic measures and many of his accomplishments are closely tied to these measures. Under Mr. Marchioni's leadership, our Insurance Operations continue to focus on granular pricing and sophisticated underwriting, as well as significant improvement in claims outcomes, that we believe give us a competitive advantage. Mr. Marchioni's major contributions in 2018 included:
Page Based on the degree of achievement of the Corporate ACIP Measures and the factors noted above, the SEBC approved the CEO's recommendation that Mr. Marchioni's 2018 ACIP be set at 188% of base salary. This compares to his initial ACIP opportunity range of 0-225% of base salary.
Mr. Marchioni's ACIP payment for 2018 was 3% lower than the aggregate of his 2017 ACIP and discretionary bonus payments. We believe his 2018 ACIP award aligns with our pay-for-performance philosophy that is intended to reward and retain key performers in critical positions.
Mr. Lanza – In addition to his general management responsibility as a member of the executive management team, Mr. Lanza, as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, has primary responsibility for all legal, corporate governance, government affairs, state filings, regulatory, and compliance matters. Mr. Lanza's major 2018 contributions were:
Page  
Based on the degree of achievement of the Corporate ACIP Measures and the factors noted above, the SEBC approved the CEO's recommendation that Mr. Lanza's 2018 ACIP be set at 106% of base salary. This compares to his initial ACIP payment opportunity range of 0-150% of base salary.
Mr. Lanza's 2018 ACIP payment was 4% lower than his 2017 ACIP payment. This award aligns with our pay-for-performance philosophy that is intended to reward and retain key performers in critical positions.
PERQUISITES
NEO perquisites are limited to tax preparation services, which is a prevailing industry practice, and in certain circumstances, moving expenses and taxes payable on those expenses. Messrs. Murphy, Marchioni, and Lanza used tax preparation services in 2018 and were reimbursed $4,500, $5,000, and $2,975, respectively.
RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
Selective Insurance Company of America ("SICA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Selective, employs all of our personnel, including all of the NEOs. We strive to provide a competitive retirement benefit program that allows us to attract and retain talent for the organization. This includes a defined contribution program, including a nonqualified defined contribution deferred compensation plan ("Deferred Compensation Plan") for certain of our officers and highly compensated employees, including the NEOs, and depending on date of hire, a defined benefit pension program, including a nonqualified supplemental pension plan for certain of our officers and highly compensated employees, in which all of the NEOs participate (other than Mr. Wilcox, whose employment commenced on January 1, 2017). These plans are consistent with benefits provided by many of the companies with which we compete for executive talent.
SICA offers a tax-qualified defined contribution plan named the Selective Insurance Retirement Savings Plan (the "Retirement Savings Plan") for employees, including the NEOs, who meet eligibility requirements. Participants could contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation to the Retirement Savings Plan, up to $18,500 in 2018. Under the Retirement Savings Plan, participant contributions are matched at 100% of the employee's salary deferrals up to 3% of the employee's eligible compensation, and at 50% of the employee's salary deferrals above 3%, up to 6% of the employee's eligible compensation, subject to limitations under the Code. Participants over the age of 50, including certain of the NEOs, were eligible in 2018 to make an additional catch-up salary deferral contribution to the Retirement Savings Plan under the Code.
The Retirement Income Plan for Selective Insurance Company of America (the "Retirement Income Plan") and the related supplemental pension plan, discussed further below, were amended to cease accrual of additional benefits under these plans effective as of March 31, 2016. In connection with the curtailment of the Retirement Income Plan, all eligible participants in the Retirement Savings Plan, including the NEOs, began receiving a non-elective contribution of 4% of base salary to their accounts under the Retirement Savings Plan, subject to limitations under the Code.
Page Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, certain executives and employees, including the NEOs may, subject to certain limitations, defer: (i) up to 50% of their base salary; (ii) up to 100% of their annual bonus (subject to certain limitations to provide for required tax withholding); and/or (iii) all or a percentage of such other compensation as otherwise designated by the administrator of the Deferred Compensation Plan. To compensate for the Code's limitations on SICA's matching contributions for the NEOs under the Retirement Savings Plan, SICA matched our NEOs' contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2018 as follows: 100% of each NEO's salary deferrals to the Retirement Savings Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan up to 3% of the employee's base salary, and 50% of the NEO's salary deferrals to the Retirement Savings Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan above 3%, up to 6% of the NEO's base salary, less any matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan. Additionally, to the extent that non-elective contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan are limited due to the provisions of the Code and the Retirement Savings Plan, non-elective contributions of 4% of base salary are made by SICA to participants' Deferred Compensation Plan accounts. Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is included in the section entitled, "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" of this Proxy Statement.
SICA also has maintained a non-contributory defined benefit pension program consisting of a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, the Retirement Income Plan, and a nonqualified supplemental pension plan for certain executives and employees. The accrual of additional benefits under the pension program ceased as of March 31, 2016. The pension program is more fully described in the section entitled, "Pension Benefits" of this Proxy Statement.
In addition, SICA maintains health and welfare benefit plans in which eligible employees, including the NEOs, participate.
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
SICA has entered into employment agreements with its key executive officers, including the NEOs, which provide for severance in the event of termination: (i) due to death or disability; (ii) without "Cause"[4]; (iii) due to resignation for "Good Reason"[5] by (A) the CEO at any time, or (B) other executives within two years following a change in control; (iv) due to resignation of the NEO within two years of the company first imposing a requirement, without the consent of the NEO, that relocates the NEO's business location more than 50 miles; and (v) without Cause or without Good Reason within two years following a change in control. The SEBC believes that these agreements are important for recruitment and retention of key executives and was advised by its Compensation Consultant that the terms of these agreements were market competitive within our peer group when they were executed. In the event of a change in control, uncertainty may arise among our key executives as to their continued employment after or in connection with such event, which may result in the departure or distraction of our key executives. The purpose of the employment agreements is to retain our key executives, and reinforce and encourage their continued attention and dedication during such a potentially critical time, even if they fear that their position will be terminated after or in connection with the change in control.
4 "Cause" is defined in the employment agreements, but generally means the executive: (i) was convicted of or pled guilty to a felony; (ii) breached a material provision of the executive's employment agreement; or (iii) engaged in misconduct which constitutes fraud in the performance of the executive's duties and obligations to the company.
5 "Good Reason" is defined in the employment agreements, but generally means: (i) a material reduction in salary; (ii) a material negative change in the executive's benefits; (iii) a material reduction of the executive's position, duties, responsibilities, and status with the company or material negative change in title or office; (iv) requiring the executive to be based at a location in excess of 50 miles from the location of the executive's office prior to a change in control; (v) failure of a counterparty to a transaction resulting in a change in control to assume the employment agreement; or (vi) a breach of the employment agreement by SICA within two years after a change in control. 
Page  
With respect to severance payments, outstanding awards under our stock and cash plans, and continued insurance coverages or reimbursement for such coverage, the change in control provisions of the employment agreements are triggered if the executive's employment is terminated without Cause or without Good Reason within two years following a change in control. This double trigger ensures such a payout does not automatically occur upon a change in control only. The employment agreements are described in the section entitled, "Employment Agreements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" of this Proxy Statement. This section includes information on multipliers used in calculating the severance payment and duration of benefit coverage (or reimbursement for the cost of such coverages) provided to individual executives upon termination. We believe these multipliers are consistent with the level and value of the position to the organization.
TAX TREATMENT AND ACCOUNTING
Code Section 162(m) prohibits publicly-held companies from deducting compensation paid to certain executive officers for federal tax purposes to the extent the officer's taxable year compensation exceeds $1 million. While the SEBC considers the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation, the SEBC also considers the other goals of our executive compensation program in making its compensation decisions, and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it believes to be in the best long-term interests of Selective, even if the awards may not be fully deductible under Code Section 162(m).
For taxable years commencing before January 1, 2018, compensation paid pursuant to a stockholder-approved plan that otherwise qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) was exempt from the annual $1 million deduction limitation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform") eliminated the performance-based compensation exception for taxable years commencing after December 31, 2017. Under Tax Reform transition relief, compensation provided under a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not materially modified after that date continues to be subject to the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m), as previously in effect. The performance-based compensation exception, however, generally will not be available for new awards of compensation granted after November 2, 2017.
Awards to NEOs made in 2018 were granted under two performance-based stockholder approved plans: (i) the Omnibus Stock Plan; and (ii) the Cash Incentive Plan. These grants were made after the November 2, 2017 date, and therefore are not eligible for the performance-based compensation exception. However, we believe that compensation paid to NEOs in 2018 under these plans is deductible under the Section 162(m) transition rules, as this compensation was designed to meet the performance-based compensation exemption under Section 162(m) and paid in satisfaction of grants that were made prior to November 2, 2017 and have not been materially modified since that time.
GAAP requires compensation expense to be measured on the income statement for all stock-based payments at grant date fair value for equity instruments (including employee stock options and restricted stock unit awards) and at market value on the date of vesting for liability instruments (including cash incentive unit awards). The SEBC has considered the impact of GAAP on our use of stock-based compensation as a retention tool. The SEBC has determined that the current estimated costs of continuing to use stock-based compensation relative to the benefits they provide are appropriate and do not warrant any change to our current incentive framework.
We have designed our compensation programs and awards to executive officers to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, where applicable. For example, payments that are subject to Section 409A of the Code and made to our executive officers under our nonqualified deferred compensation plans on account of the executives' separation from service are not payable before the first day of the seventh month following the date of separation from service if the executives are "specified employees" under Section 409A of the Code.

The aggregate grant date fair value reported in this column assumes the following: (i) the predetermined performance goals for the restricted stock unit grants are probable of being attained; (ii) initial per unit values for the cash incentive unit awards of $100; and (iii) a 100% peer group unit multiplier for cash incentive unit awards. For further discussion of the fair value calculation of the awards in this column, please refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Selective's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The maximum value assuming the highest level of performance conditions for the performance-based restricted stock units are consistent with the amounts above. Although the maximum number of performance-based cash incentive units potentially issuable is 200% of the original grant for the 2016 grant, and 150% of the original grant for the 2017 and 2018 grants, the ultimate maximum value of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 grants cannot be determined due to the fact that, as stated above, the initial value of each unit is adjusted based on the TSR of Selective common stock over the grant's three-year performance period, the maximum value of which is not determinable at this time.
(4) Amounts in this column are annual cash incentive plan awards to the NEOs earned in 2018 and paid in 2019, earned in 2017 and paid in 2018, and earned in 2016 and paid in 2017. These awards were granted under the Cash Incentive Plan.
(5) Amounts in this column reflect the actuarial increase in the present value of each NEO's pension benefits under all defined benefit pension plans of SICA, determined using the same interest rate and mortality assumptions as those used for financial statement reporting purposes. There were no changes to the benefit formulas under the defined pension benefit plans in 2018, as the plans were amended to cease further accruals effective as of March 31, 2016. The changes in pension values reported in this column are primarily attributable to an increase in the discount rate used to calculate present value and the change from MP2017 to MP2018 of the mortality improvement projection scale. There were no above-market or preferential earnings on deferred compensation under SICA's nonqualified deferred compensation program.
(6) For 2018, amounts in this column for each NEO reflect the following (amounts in this footnote may not exactly match the figures in the Summary Compensation Table due to rounding):
Page GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS
The following table shows the grants of plan-based awards to our NEOs in 2018:
(1) Amounts represent minimum and maximum potential ACIP awards under our Cash Incentive Plan for 2018 based on 2018 base salary rates. Maximum awards reflect the maximum ACIP award established by the SEBC. Actual payouts of the above-referenced awards are included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. For information regarding the ACIP, see the section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis entitled, "Annual Cash Incentive Program."
(2) Performance-based cash incentive unit awards were granted under the Cash Incentive Plan, and performance-based restricted stock unit awards were granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan. For a description of the material terms of such awards, see the section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis entitled, "Elements of Long-Term Compensation."
(3) The number of performance-based cash incentive units paid can range from 0-150%, and therefore, the amount payable could be $0. The threshold selected represents the 30th percentile of the Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group, the target represents the 50th percentile of the Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group, and the maximum represents greater than or equal to the 80th percentile of the Cash Incentive Unit Peer Group.
(4) This column includes the grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards and cash incentive unit awards with an initial value of $100 per unit.

Page PENSION BENEFITS
SICA maintains a tax-qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, the Retirement Income Plan. Many SICA employees, including the NEOs (other than Mr. Wilcox, whose employment commenced on January 1, 2017) and certain former employees whose employment commenced on or before December 31, 2005, are eligible to receive benefits under the Retirement Income Plan. SICA also maintains the unfunded Selective Insurance Supplemental Pension Plan ("SERP") to provide supplemental benefits to certain executives and other participants in the Retirement Income Plan equal to the difference between: (i) the benefits payable to these participants under the Retirement Income Plan, calculated without regard to Code limitations on annual amounts payable under the Retirement Income Plan; and (ii) the actual benefits payable to these participants under the Retirement Income Plan.
The Retirement Income Plan and the SERP were frozen in the first quarter of 2013, when both plans were amended to cease accrual of additional benefits under these plans for all participants as of March 31, 2016. Participants as of March 31, 2016 remain entitled to the benefits already earned but have not earned additional benefits since that date, and no new participants have been admitted to the plans.
The Retirement Income Plan was amended as of July 1, 2002, to provide for different calculations based on age and company service as of that date. Monthly benefits payable at normal retirement age under the Retirement Income Plan and SERP for the NEOs are computed as follows. Defined terms used in this section, but not defined in this Proxy Statement, have the meanings given to them in the Retirement Income Plan.
The earliest retirement age is 55 with 10 years of service or the attainment of 70 points (age plus years of service). If a participant chooses to begin receiving benefits before his or her 65th birthday, the amount of the monthly benefit will be reduced as follows:
Page At retirement, participants receive monthly pension payments. There are four optional forms of payments that can be chosen as alternatives to the normal form of payment, which for a married participant is an automatic 50% joint and surviving spouse annuity, and for an unmarried participant is a single life annuity.
The following table shows information regarding the pension benefits of our NEOs:
(1) The Retirement Income Plan imposes a one-year waiting period for plan participation, which year is not included in years of credited service.
(2) Present value as of December 31, 2018 is calculated on the basis of Normal Retirement Age of 65 using a 4.46% discount rate. For further discussion, see Note 14. "Retirement Plans" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of Selective's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
(3) As noted above, based on Mr. Wilcox's date of hire of January 1, 2017, he is not eligible to participate in the Retirement Income Plan or the SERP.
NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to defer receipt of up to 50% of base salary and up to 100% of their annual bonus (subject to certain limitations to provide for required tax withholding). Participant accounts are credited with a notional rate of return (positive or negative) based on the performance of investment options selected by the participants from a menu of notional investment options. Participants can elect to schedule in-service withdrawals or withdrawals upon separation from service.
SICA makes matching contributions to a participant's Deferred Compensation Plan account to supplement matching contributions under the Retirement Savings Plan. For 2018, such matching contributions consisted of 100% of the first 3% of base salary and 50% of the next 3% of base salary deferred to the Retirement Savings Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan together, minus any matching contribution made to a participant's Retirement Savings Plan account. Effective January 1, 2010, the Deferred Compensation Plan was amended for participants ineligible to participate in the Retirement Income Plan to provide a non-elective contribution to the extent not made to a participant's Retirement Savings Plan account due to the limitations under the Code and the Retirement Savings Plan. The non-elective contribution to the Deferred Compensation Plan is equal to 4% of a participant's base salary, minus any non-elective contribution made to the Retirement Savings Plan. In conjunction with the amendment of the Retirement Income Plan and the SERP to cease accrual of further benefits under these plans effective as of March 31, 2016, all participants affected by the curtailment, including the NEOs, became eligible for the non-elective contribution effective April 5, 2013.

Page The following table shows information regarding payments and benefits to which our NEOs would be entitled under the scenarios shown as of December 31, 2018:
(1) Other than a resignation for Good Reason.
(2) This column includes the value of vested and unvested performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan and any related accrued DEUs. These performance-based awards would normally vest upon: (i) achievement of early or normal retirement eligibility or continuation in service through the end of the applicable performance period; and (ii) the achievement of the specified performance goals applicable to each such award, and be payable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. Restricted stock unit and cash incentive unit awards granted to Messrs. Murphy and Lanza have vested, but their ultimate payment value will only be determined upon achievement of the performance condition, as each of these NEOs have attained early retirement eligibility. Also included in this column is the value of performance-based cash incentive units awarded under the Cash Incentive Plan to the NEOs. The value of such awards is calculated using: (i) the target 100% unit multiplier for the number of cash incentive units granted; and (ii) the per unit value at December 31, 2018. Under the Cash Incentive Plan, participants' awards, including the NEOs' awards, would fully vest upon achievement of early or normal retirement eligibility or continuation in service through the end of the payment date and be payable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period.
(3) This column includes the value of unvested performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan and any related accrued DEUs. In the event of total disability, these performance-based awards would normally vest for all participants, including the NEOs, upon the achievement of the specified performance goals applicable to each such award, and be payable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. In the event of death, these performance-based awards are immediately vested and payable for all participants, including the NEOs. Also included in this column is the value of performance-based cash incentive units awarded under the Cash Incentive Plan to the NEOs. The value of such awards is calculated using: (i) the target 100% unit multiplier for the number of cash incentive units granted; and (ii) the per unit value at December 31, 2018. Under the Cash Incentive Plan, participants' awards, in the event of total disability, including the NEOs' awards, would fully vest and be payable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. This column also includes the severance payment provided for in each NEO's Employment Agreement. Payments in this column will be reduced by life or disability insurance payments under policies for which SICA paid premiums.
(4) This column includes the value of unvested performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan and any related accrued DEUs. These performance-based awards would normally vest upon: (i) a termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason; and (ii) the achievement of the specified performance goals applicable to each such award, and be payable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. Also included in this column is the value of performance-based cash incentive units awarded under the Cash Incentive Plan to the NEOs. The value is calculated using: (i) the target 100% unit multiplier for the number of cash incentive units granted; and (ii) the per unit value at December 31, 2018. The awards would fully vest and be payable following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. Also included in this column are the severance payment and the value of applicable medical, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance coverages, as provided for in each respective NEO's Employment Agreement.
(5) This column includes the value of unvested performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan, and any related accrued DEUs, which would immediately vest and be payable upon a termination of employment following a change in control. This column also includes the value of performance-based cash incentive units awarded under the Cash Incentive Plan to the NEOs, all of which would vest upon a termination of employment following a change in control. The value of such awards is calculated using: (i) a 150% per unit multiplier; and (ii) the per unit value at December 31, 2018. Also included in this column are the severance payment and the value of applicable medical, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance coverages, as provided for
Page in each NEO's Employment Agreement. This column also includes the value of any tax gross-up payment necessary to offset any excise tax imposed on the payment and benefits disclosed in this column, other than for Messrs. Marchioni and Wilcox whose employment agreements do not contain this provision.
CEO PAY RATIO
As a result of rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the SEC requires disclosure of the CEO to median employee pay ratio. We identified the median employee in 2017 by tabulating 2017 W-2 Medicare Wages on October 31, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed full-time, part-time, or seasonally. We did not make any adjustments or annualize compensation for employees who we did not employ for all of 2017. We believe the use of W-2 Medicare Wages is a simple and consistent methodology that we can easily replicate in future years. To determine if it was appropriate to use the same median employee for 2018 as in 2017, we considered that we had: (i) no significant acquisitions or divestitures during 2018; (ii) no significant reductions in workforce or notable employee turnover in 2018; and (iii) no material changes in the median employee's circumstances, pay, or employment status.
We analyzed the median employee's 2018 W-2 Medicare Wages compared to 2017 to confirm there were no significant changes in the median employee's compensation arrangements year-over-year. Based on these results, the lack of change in our employee population and compensation arrangements, and consistent with applicable SEC regulations, we did not change our median employee for 2018.
Mr. Murphy's 2018 total compensation was $4,946,192 (as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table), and our median employee's 2018 total compensation was $101,980. Mr. Murphy's 2018 total compensation was approximately 48.5 times that of our median employee.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
We compensate non-employee directors for their service on the Board with a combination of cash and equity, the amounts of which are commensurate with their role and involvement, and consistent with peer company practices. In setting director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time and effort our directors expend in fulfilling their duties, as well as the skill level required of members of our Board. We intend to compensate our non-employee directors in a way that is competitive, attracts and retains a high caliber of directors, and aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. Mr. Murphy, our Chief Executive Officer in fiscal year 2018, did not receive additional compensation for his service as a director.
The SEBC, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving compensation for non-employee directors, including, but not limited to, the following elements: retainer, meeting fees, committee fees, committee chair fees, lead independent director fees, and equity and stock compensation. In October 2017, the SEBC undertook a review of the amount and form of compensation paid to our non-employee directors for their service on the Board. The SEBC considered the results of an independent analysis completed by the Compensation Consultant, who reviewed non-employee director compensation trends and data from companies comprising the peer group used by the SEBC in its review of executive compensation. After further consultation with the Compensation Consultant, in light of peer data and the amount of responsibility of the positions, the SEBC increased each of the Audit Committee Annual Chairperson Fee and Annual Lead Independent Director Fee to $25,000, from $15,000, for 2018. The SEBC made no other changes to the non-employee directors' compensation program for fiscal year 2018.
Page The following table shows compensation earned by or paid to our non-employee directors during 2018.
(1) Information on the election by directors to receive shares of Selective common stock instead of cash for their 2018 annual retainer is set forth below under the heading "Annual Retainer Stock Election."
(2) This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value for the 2018 grants of restricted stock units to directors, based on a grant date fair value of $55.15 per share, calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Information on outstanding options and unvested restricted stock units held by each director as of December 31, 2018, is set forth below under the heading "Outstanding Options and Unvested Restricted Stock Units."

As the Director Compensation table above shows, in 2018 the non-employee directors received compensation in the forms of restricted stock units and cash for their director service. The SEBC annually reviews and approves the compensation for non-employee directors, including the Annual Retainer Fee. For 2018, non-employee directors had the election to receive up to 100% of their Annual Retainer Fee in shares of Selective common stock. Any remaining balance of the Annual Retainer Fee was paid in cash. Non-employee directors made this election by
Page December 15, 2017. The Annual Retainer Fee was paid in one installment on the second business day following Selective's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
For 2018, the annual equity grant under Selective's director compensation program was made entirely in restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan. Shares of Selective common stock paid to directors as a portion of their Annual Retainer Fee were issued under the Omnibus Stock Plan. Committee Attendance Fees, Annual Chairperson Fees, and the Lead Independent Director Fee were paid in cash pursuant to the table above.
Annual Retainer Stock Election
Directors elected to receive shares of Selective common stock for all or a portion of their 2018 Annual Retainer Fee as follows:
Outstanding Options and Unvested Restricted Stock Units
The aggregate number of outstanding options and unvested restricted stock units held by each director as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:

The Salary and Employee Benefits Committee: (i) has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management; and (ii) based on this review and discussion, recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board approved, the inclusion of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in Selective's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and this Proxy Statement.
Submitted by the Salary and Employee Benefits Committee of Selective's Board of Directors,

INFORMATION ABOUT PROPOSAL 2
As required under the Dodd-Frank Act, our Board of Directors provides Selective's stockholders the opportunity to vote annually to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (also referred to as say-on-pay). Although the vote is non-binding, the Board and the SEBC value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers. In 2018, our stockholders overwhelmingly supported our compensation decisions with approximately 97% of votes cast voting in favor of our say-on-pay proposal.
We urge stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, which discusses our compensation philosophy, policies, and procedures. The following resolution is being submitted to stockholders for approval at the Annual Meeting pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Selective Insurance Group, Inc. ("Selective") approve, on an advisory basis, the 2018 compensation of Selective's named executive officers as such compensation is disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K or any successor thereto."
If a majority of stockholders vote against this proposal, neither the Board nor the SEBC will be required to take any specific action because this vote is non-binding and advisory. Nonetheless, consistent with our record of stockholder responsiveness, the SEBC will consider our stockholders' concerns and take them into account in future determinations concerning our executive compensation programs. The Board of Directors recommends you indicate your support for the compensation of our named executive officers as outlined in the above resolution.

Even if our stockholders ratify the appointment, the Board of Directors may direct the appointment of a different auditing firm at any time during the 2019 fiscal year if the Board determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Selective and our stockholders.
Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
