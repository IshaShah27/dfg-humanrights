NOTICE OF 2019
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
AND PROXY STATEMENT
1293 South Main Street — Akron, Ohio 44301
March 20, 2019
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
It is a privilege to work on behalf of Myers shareholders as Chairman of its Board of Directors. I am writing to update you on our work.
During the past year, we had a few transitions among our executive team. Matteo Anversa left his position to return to the automotive industry, joining a larger company as CFO.  We wish him well in his new role. We are fortunate that our longtime Chief Accounting Officer (and former interim CFO) Kevin Brackman was able to step seamlessly into this role in December. Last year, we were also pleased to have Andrean Horton join the Myers team as Chief Legal Officer. Her prior experience serving as Chief Legal Officer and Secretary of a global enterprise, combined with her expertise in handling complex legal matters, make her an excellent addition to our executive team.  Prior to this position being created, we were fortunate to have the wise counsel of Mark Helm from Munger, Tolles and Olson. 
To succeed the two directors who did not stand for re-election at last year's annual meeting, we appointed two new directors during the year: Ron DeFeo and Lori Lutey.  Ron, who joined in August, is the former Executive Chairman and CEO of Kennametal, Inc. and was also Chairman and CEO of Terex. He brings strong operations expertise to the board along with insights that come from successfully running large, global industrial companies. Lori joined the board in September, after a distinguished career as CFO of Schneider National and VP, Finance at FedEx Services. She strengthens the board's accounting and financial expertise, given her extensive experience in new product and customer pricing analysis. Both Ron and Lori are already making very positive contributions to the board. Our eight independent directors -- three of whom are women -- contribute a broad range of expertise in strategy, M&A, operations, financials, and capital allocation.
We continue to incorporate best practices in our corporate governance. For example, we conduct annual elections for all directors; ensure there is an independent board chair and committees comprised exclusively of independent board members; and utilize the services of an independent third party to facilitate annual self-evaluations of our board performance.
The committee system is central to our governance structure. Each of the Audit and Compensation Committees reviews and approves all proposed charges and adjustments (affecting earnings and employee compensation) at their respective committee meetings on a quarterly basis.
Our Compensation Committee continues to work to optimize the company's compensation program, ensuring that management's short- and long-term incentives are properly aligned with shareholders' interests. The Governance and Nominating Committee was responsible for successfully recruiting our new directors, and also is charged with overseeing board training and evaluation. The Audit Committee continued to work closely with our outside independent accounting firm and internal financial staff, including our new CFO, to ensure the quality of our financial controls.  We also created a Finance Committee as an ad hoc committee of the board in 2018 to review optimal financial structures for the company. 
Myers sold new stock in August, which improved the balance sheet and substantially lowered the company's leverage ratio (several directors purchased stock in the open market after this offering). We have been careful stewards of this new capital and are keenly aware of relative valuations of alternative uses of these funds.
As a board, we hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards. We continue to self-evaluate. As previously noted, we use an independent party to evaluate every board member, each committee, and the board as a whole. To maximize the effectiveness of these evaluations, we discuss this feedback—in both board and committee meetings — and establish objectives for continuous improvement. Just as we value peer evaluations, the board believes director education is valuable. Last fall, for example, one meeting began with a presentation on the board's proper role in M&A, delivered by a corporate director who is a leading M&A lawyer and former CEO.
Your board works closely with management to evaluate and define Myers' enterprise strategy, which was first presented to the investment community two years ago. Our long-term strategy is guided by three key operating principles: a niche market focus; flexible operations through the use of an asset-light business model; and strong cash flow growth. More recently, we announced actions required for the successful transformation of our Distribution segment.  
As a board, we have been deeply involved with management in defining Myers' culture as one characterized by a "winning" mentality and a results-based orientation. We are committed to transparency and candor, while remaining consistently attentive to both our customers' needs and our employees' safety. We want our employees to act and feel like owners, while operating with the highest possible ethical standards and promoting diversity of all kinds throughout the organization. 
Environmental stewardship and corporate responsibility are likewise very important to the company — and something about which several shareholders have inquired. We incorporate environmental consciousness into all aspects of our operations by, among other measures, recycling and reprocessing plastic scrap in our factories. We also manufacture returnable packaging products and implement and maintain recycling programs. Of course, we conserve energy whenever we can, and encourage our customers to focus on sustainability, as well. At the beginning of each board meeting, we review the previous quarter's safety record (which, thankfully, remains well below the industry average). 
Effective last year, we modified the method (but not the actual dollar equivalent) of director pay. For a director's stock retainer, rather than issuing the stock portion of our annual retainer to directors at the end of a year of service (at the annual meeting) we began issuing restricted stock at the beginning of the year of service (when directors are elected at the annual meeting), which will not vest until the first anniversary of the grant.  In our case, directors received their restricted stock grant for their 2018 term of service at the annual meeting date in April 2018 (at a price above $24/share) and such shares will vest in April 2019. This change was made to be more consistent with current best practices.  In this year's proxy statement, it will appear that the stock portion of our director retainer doubled. In next year's proxy statement, the "director stock retainer" portion will be approximately half of the amount appearing this year. I wanted to alert you to what is, in effect, a bookkeeping change, even though there is no actual economic change in the stock retainer portion paid to directors. 
For the third consecutive year, we reached out to shareholders (Compensation Committee Chair Sarah Coffin, Treasurer Monica Vinay, and I offered to meet with each shareholder owning more than 1% of the company). This year, we met with shareholders and once again gained valuable insights about their opinions on governance and views on other matters. 
We were gratified by the results of the "say on pay" proposal at last year's annual meeting, when almost 25 million shares voted for and only about 260,000 shares voted against. This was a substantial improvement over two years ago when about 6.7 million shares voted against this same "say on pay" proposal. 
As always, we welcome feedback from our shareholders. Shareholders may send communication by email to governance@myersind.com, or by mail or courier delivery addressed as follows: Board of Directors (or Committee Chair, Board Member, or Non-Management Directors, as the case may require), c/o Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, Myers Industries, Inc., 1293 Main Street South, Akron, Ohio 44301, as outlined more completely in our Communication Procedures for Interested Parties and Shareholders available on the company's website www.myersindustries.com.
In last year's letter, I was pleased to report that Myers' stock outperformed during 2017 (up by about 40%, compared to almost 22% for the S&P 500). Unfortunately, Myers' stock price performance was disappointing last year: down by about 20% vs. about -4% for the S&P 500. We continue to believe that one year is not an appropriate gauge of long-term performance. 
Your board remains very active and engaged, and we begin 2019 with a firm commitment to building long-term shareholder value at Myers. Thank you for your support of the company and confidence in our efforts on your behalf. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 F. Jack Liebau, Jr.

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY (CONTINUED)
Recent Highlights and Achievements
The Company's management and its Board of Directors (the "Board" or "Board of Directors") have developed a strategic vision for the Company, which they have focused on implementing for the past several years. This long-term strategy is guided by three key operating principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Niche market focus 
• Flexible operations through the use of an asset-light business model 
• Strong cash flow growth 
[END TABLE]
The Company's mission is to instill a culture where safety and efficiency are part of every aspect of the business and where employees are empowered to act like owners. The Company's management and Board of Directors work hand-in-hand to develop our strategic vision and together review the Company's strategy and performance periodically throughout the year.
Myers Industries has made meaningful progress executing its long-term strategy.  The Company's key achievements in 2018 included, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Generated double-digit year-over-year sales growth in our Food & Beverage market, leading to an increase in net sales of 6.6% in our Material Handling Segment and 3.6% for the enterprise 
• Launched a new product in our Consumer market that is expected to drive mid-single-digit sales growth in that market in 2019 
• Expanded our gross margin by 280 basis points to 31.6% as a result of pricing initiatives and 80/20 and lean continuous improvement actions, combined with the benefits of the strategic footprint realignment that we completed in 2017 
• Improved adjusted operating income from $31.5 million in 2017 to $40.4 million in 2018, a 28.5% increase (excluding $33.3 million of charges related to the 2015 sale of the Company's Lawn and Garden business) 
• Reduced total debt by $74.2 million, or 49.2% 
• Reduced our leverage ratio to 1.2x as defined by our current debt agreements 
• Increased cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations by 22.9% to $60.4 million, driven by a reduction in working capital of $5.9 million, or 21.6%, despite higher sales 
• Completed public offering of 4.6 million shares of our common stock at $18.50 per share with net proceeds of approximately $79.5 million. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, we also announced a set of strategic transformation actions for our Distribution segment. The actions are expected to be implemented by the end of 2019 and include a new go-to-market strategy, a contribution margin improvement initiative, and an overhead and logistics optimization plan. The goal of the transformation is to reach a 10% EBITDA margin run-rate in 2020.

Shareholder Engagement
One of our key priorities is conducting robust engagement with our shareholders in order to provide transparency into our business and determine which issues are important to our shareholders. Participants in our engagement programs include executive management, members of the Board of Directors and Investor Relations personnel. Our methods of engagement include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Earnings conference calls 
• Investor conferences 
• One-on-one investor meetings and one-on-one investor conference calls 
• Outreach calls and meetings with shareholders' corporate governance departments 
[END TABLE]
Shareholder Outreach
We believe engaging in shareholder outreach is an important element of strong corporate governance.  In 2018, in a continuation of the Company's shareholder outreach efforts that began in 2016, members of our Board and executive management acted on this belief and contacted the top 14 shareholders who own 1% or greater of outstanding shares and represent collectively approximately 73% of total shares outstanding. Following this outreach, conference calls were conducted with two of the 14 shareholders initially approached who had expressed interest in having a conversation with our management and directors. During our outreach meetings, we discussed corporate governance matters, board diversity, the safety, environmental and social policies and reporting practices of the Company, and other items of shareholder interest. 
The Company values the input received from these discussions with shareholders. Following these conversations, the Company has continued to emphasize the importance of safety in our operations and has renewed its focus on enhancing sustainable business practices and incorporating environmental consciousness throughout our operations.  Additionally, the Compensation Committee of the Company regularly evaluates the Company's compensation programs and considers shareholder input in evaluating the programs.

 Corporate Governance and Compensation Practices and Policies
The Board of Directors is committed to maintaining sound corporate governance and a compensation structure that promotes the best interests of our shareholders.   
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Company has adopted "Corporate Governance Guidelines" and a "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics" for the Company's directors, officers and employees.  Each of our corporate governance policies is available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page of our website at www.myersindustries.com.
Corporate Governance and Compensation Practices
Shareholder Outreach
In 2018, the Company and members of the Board continued to conduct considerable shareholder outreach, through which we have requested input from our largest institutional investors and other shareholders collectively holding approximately 73% of our outstanding shares.  
Following this outreach, discussions were ultimately conducted with two of the shareholders initially approached who had indicated interest in having a conversation with our management and directors. The Company received feedback on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• corporate governance matters  
• Board diversity 
• safety, environmental and social policies and reporting practices of the Company 
[END TABLE]
We value shareholder views and insights and expect to continue to dialogue with our shareholders. 
Annual Elections
In accordance with best practices, all of our directors are elected annually.
Independent Chairman 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Since October 2009, the Company has maintained an independent Chairman. F. Jack Liebau, Jr. has served as the independent Chairman since the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
• The Company believes this leadership structure is appropriate as it further aligns the interests of the Company and our shareholders by ensuring independent leadership of the Board 
• The independent Chairman serves as a liaison between our directors and the Company's management and helps to maintain open communication and discussion by the Board 
• Our independent Chairman is an ex officio member of each of our standing committees 
• Duties of the Chairman are specified in the Charter of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and include serving in a presiding capacity, coordinating the activities of the Board, and such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may determine from time-to-time. This charter is available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page on our website at www.myersindustries.com. 
[END TABLE]
 Board and Committee Independence
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Periodic Review of Director Independence:  The Board of Directors reviews the independence of each director using the current standards for "independence" established by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and other applicable regulations and considers any other material relationships a director may have with the Company as disclosed in annual director and officer questionnaires. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a majority of the Board of Directors be comprised of independent directors and the charters of each of the Board's committees require that all committee members be independent 
• Independence Determination:  The Board has determined that Mses. Coffin, Lutey and Scaccetti and Messrs. De Feo, Foley, Liebau, Lisman and Stefanko (all of its current members except for Mr. Banyard, our President and Chief Executive Officer) are independent under these standards.  The determination of whether a director is "independent" is based upon the Board's review of the relationships between each director and the Company, if any, under the Company's "Board of Directors Independence Criteria" policy, and the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE. In connection with the Board's determination regarding the independence of each non-management director and nominee, the Board considered any transactions, relationships and arrangements as required by our independence guidelines. In particular, the Board considered the following relationships: 
• Committee Independence:  All members of the Company's Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee have been determined to be independent directors.  In addition, the Board has determined that the members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee meet the additional independence criteria required for such committee membership under the applicable NYSE listing standards  
• Other Relationships:  Except as set forth in this Proxy Statement, neither the Company nor any of the Board nominees or any of their associates have or will have any arrangements or understandings with any person with respect to any future employment by the Company or its affiliates or with respect to any future transactions to which the Company or any of its affiliates will or may be a party 
[END TABLE]
Director Resignation Policy
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pursuant to the Company's director resignation policy, in an uncontested election, any incumbent director who receives a greater number of votes "Withheld" from his or her election than votes "For" his or her election (and with respect to such incumbent director's election at least 25% of the Company's shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon were "Withheld" from the election of such director) shall submit an offer of resignation to the Board of Directors  
• The Governance Committee will then recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject any tendered resignations, and the Board will decide whether to accept or reject such tendered resignations  
• The Board's decision will be publicly disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")   
• If an incumbent director's tendered resignation is rejected, he or she will continue to serve until his or her successor is elected, or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office, or death. If an incumbent director's tendered resignation is accepted, then the Board will have the sole discretion to fill any resulting vacancy to the extent permitted by the Company's Amended and Restated Code of Regulations 
[END TABLE]
Over-Boarding Policy
The Company has adopted a policy that the maximum number of public company boards on which a non-CEO director may sit is five (including the Company's board) and the maximum number of public company boards on which a CEO director may sit is three (including the Company's board). Board Role in Risk Oversight
The Board annually reviews the Company's strategic plan, which addresses, among other things, the Company's risks and opportunities. Certain areas of oversight are delegated to the relevant Committees of the Board and the Committees regularly report back on their deliberations. This oversight is enabled by reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment, monitoring and management of enterprise-wide risks. Every year, management conducts an enterprise-wide risk assessment of the Company and each of its business segments and presents the assessment to the Board for review. The focus of this assessment includes a review of strategic, financial, operational, compliance, reputational and technology (IT) objectives and risks for the Company. In addition: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee: The Audit Committee maintains primary responsibility for oversight of risks and exposures pertaining to the accounting, auditing and financial reporting processes of the Company 
• Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee maintains primary responsibility for risks and exposures associated with oversight of the administration and implementation of our compensation policies 
• Governance Committee: The Governance Committee maintains primary responsibility for risks and exposures associated with corporate governance and succession planning 
[END TABLE]
Each committee also considers the reputational risk implicated by the oversight responsibilities described above.
Clawback Policy
The Company maintains a "Clawback Policy" that provides for the recoupment of certain incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance (whether or not based upon misconduct) with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws. The Clawback Policy is administered by the Compensation Committee and applies to current and former executive officers and such other employees who may from time to time be deemed subject to the policy by the Compensation Committee.
Succession Planning
Our Board, in coordination with the Governance Committee, oversees succession planning for the CEO and other officers of the Company. As part of its succession planning oversight, the Board reviews the senior management team's experience, skills, competence and potential, to help assess which executives have the ability to develop the attributes that the Board believes are necessary to lead and execute the Company's strategic vision.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Company maintains "Stock Ownership Guidelines" whereby our executive officers and non-employee directors are expected to hold a specified amount of our common stock.  These expectations are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CEO:  5X annual base salary 
• CFO and CLO:  3X annual base salary 
• Vice Presidents: 1X annual base salary 
• Non-Employee Directors: 5X annual cash Board retainer  
[END TABLE]
The executive officers and non-employee directors have five years from the date they become subject to the guidelines to attain the ownership requirement. These "Stock Ownership Guidelines" are available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page of the Company's website at www.myersindustries.com.
Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy
The Company prohibits directors, officers and employees from engaging in any hedging or pledging transactions with respect to Company shares. Board Member Recruiting Guidelines 
The Company's Board Member Recruiting Guidelines outline the process for nominating potential director candidates for consideration by the Governance Committee. These recruiting guidelines are available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page of the Company's website at www.myersindustries.com.
Executive Sessions of the Board and Committees 
The Board has a policy requiring the non-management directors, both as to the Board and Committees, to meet regularly in executive session without any management personnel or employee directors present. During 2018, the Board and each Committee met regularly in executive session as follows: Board, eight times; Audit Committee, six times; Compensation Committee, four times; and the Governance Committee, four times.
Presiding Directors
The Chairman of each Committee was selected as the Presiding Director for each Committee executive session.
Anonymous Reporting
The Audit Committee maintains procedures, including a worldwide telephone "hotline," which allows employees and interested parties to report any financial or other concerns anonymously as further detailed under "Shareholder Communication with Directors" below.
Code of Ethics
We have a "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics," which incorporates a "Code of Ethical Conduct for the Finance Officers and Finance Department Personnel," which embodies our commitment to ethical and legal business practices, as well as satisfying the NYSE requirements to implement and maintain such policies. The Board expects all of our officers, directors and other members of our workforce to act ethically at all times. This policy is available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page on our website at www.myersindustries.com.
Annual Board and Committee Self-Assessments
The Board conducts annual self-assessments of the Board, as well as of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance Committee, to assist in determining whether the Board and its Committees are functioning effectively.  In early 2016 and 2017, evaluations were conducted by an independent third party through telephone interviews and feedback was provided to the Board, committees and individual directors. In late 2017 through 2018 and in early 2019, the Board conducted self-assessment evaluations with the assistance of outside counsel and reviewed the results as a Board.
Shareholder Communication with Directors
Our Board provides the following methods for interested parties and shareholders to send communications to a director, to a Committee of the Board, to the non-management directors, or to the Board: Written Communication
Interested parties may send such communications by e-mail to governance@myersind.com or by mail or courier delivery addressed as follows:
Board of Directors (or Committee Chairman, Director or Non-Management Directors, as the case may be)
c/o Secretary
Myers Industries, Inc.
1293 South Main Street
Akron, Ohio 44301
All communications directed to the "Board of Directors" or to the "Non-Management Directors" will be forwarded unopened or unread to the Chairman of the Governance Committee. The Chairman of the Governance Committee in turn determines whether the communications should be forwarded to the appropriate members of the Board and, if so, forwards them accordingly. For communications addressed to a particular director or the Chairman of a particular Committee of the Board, however, the Secretary will forward those communications, unopened or unread, directly to the person or Committee Chairman in question.
Toll Free Hotline
The Company maintains a "hotline" for receiving, retaining and addressing complaints from any interested party regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters, and procedures for the anonymous submission of these concerns.
The hotline is maintained by an independent third party. Interested parties may also use this hotline to communicate with the Board.
Any interested party may contact a director, a Committee of the Board, the non-management directors, or the Board through the toll free hotline at (877) 285-4145.
The hotline is available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Note that all reports made through the hotline are directed to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Secretary. We do not permit any retaliation of any kind against any person who submits a complaint or concern under these procedures.

Each of the foregoing nominees is recommended by the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee believes that each of the nominees possesses certain key attributes that the Governance Committee believes to be important for an effective Board.  There are, and during the past ten years there have been, no legal proceedings material to an evaluation of the ability of any director, nominee, or executive officer of Myers Industries to act in such capacity or concerning his or her integrity. There are no family relationships among any of the directors, director nominees and executive officers.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the director nominees listed above. Nominating Process
The Governance Committee reviews and evaluates individuals for nomination to stand for election as a director who are recommended to the Governance Committee: in writing by any of our shareholders or by our current or past directors, executive officers, or identified by professional search firms retained by the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee also engaged a professional search firm during 2018 to assist the Committee and the Board in connection with the identification of Mr. De Feo and Ms. Lutey as potential director candidates.
Recruiting Guidelines and Director Qualifications
The Company's Board Member Recruiting Guidelines outline the process for the Governance Committee to recruit and evaluate potential director candidates. These guidelines are available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page of the Company's website at www.myersindustries.com. In considering these potential candidates for nomination to stand for election, the Governance Committee will consider:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The current composition of the Board and how well it functions as a group 
• The talents, personalities, and strengths of current directors 
• The value of contributions made by individual directors 
• The need for a person with specific skills, experiences or background relevant to the Company's strategy to be added to the Board 
• Any anticipated vacancies due to retirement or other reasons 
• Other factors that may enter into the nomination decision 
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee endeavors to select nominees that contribute unique skills and professional experiences in order to advance the performance of the Board of Directors and establish a well-rounded Board with diverse views that reflect the interests of our shareholders. The Governance Committee considers diversity as one of a number of factors in identifying nominees for directors; however, there is no formal policy in this regard. The Governance Committee views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint, in addition to traditional concepts of diversity such as race and gender.
When considering an individual candidate's suitability for the Board, the Governance Committee will evaluate each individual on a case-by-case basis. The Governance Committee does not prescribe minimum qualifications or standards for directors, however, the Governance Committee looks for directors who have personal characteristics, educational backgrounds and relevant experience that would be expected to help further the goals of the Company. In addition, the Governance Committee will review the extent of the candidate's demonstrated excellence and success in his or her chosen business, profession, or other career and the skills and talents that the candidate would be expected to add to the Board. The Governance Committee may choose, in individual cases, to conduct interviews with the candidate and/or contact references, business associates, other members of boards on which the candidate serves or other appropriate persons to obtain additional information. The Governance Committee will make its determinations on whether to nominate an individual candidate based on the Board's then-current needs, the merits of that candidate and the qualifications of other available candidates.
Shareholder Recommendation Policy
The Governance Committee will consider individuals for nomination to stand for election as a director who are recommended to it in writing by any of our shareholders that strictly follow the below procedures.  Shareholders making recommendations for directors must:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Certify that the person making the recommendation is a shareholder of the Company (including the number of shares held as of the date of the recommendation)

• Provide a letter of recommendation to the following address: Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, c/o Secretary, Myers Industries, Inc., 1293 South Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44301

In the event that the date of such meeting to elect directors is not publicly disclosed at least seventy (70) days prior to the date of such meeting, written notice of such shareholder's intent to nominate a candidate must be received by the Secretary not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first provided to the shareholders. A shareholder wishing to directly nominate an individual to serve as a director must follow the procedure outlined in Article I, Section 12 of our Amended and Restated Code of Regulations, titled "Advance Notice of Director Nomination" and then send a signed letter of nomination to the following address: Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, c/o Secretary, Myers Industries, Inc., 1293 South Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44301.

Committee Charters and Policies
The Board has adopted written charters for each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance Committee. Each committee reviews and evaluates the adequacy of its charter at least annually and recommends any proposed changes to the Board for approval. Each of the written charters and policies of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance Committee are available on the "Corporate Governance" page accessed from the "Investor Relations" page of the Company's website at: www.myersindustries.com. Director Compensation
The Company has structured its non-employee director compensation to attract and retain highly qualified directors and to compensate directors for their service, while also aligning the interests of the directors to the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders.
In addition to the compensation provided to our non-employee directors, which is described below, our Amended and Restated Code of Regulations provides that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent then permitted by law, any of our directors or former directors who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any matter, whether civil or criminal, by reason of the fact that the individual is or was a director of the Company, or serving at our request as a director of another entity. We have entered into indemnity agreements with each of our directors contractually obligating us to provide such protection. We also currently have in effect director and officer insurance coverage.
2018 Non-Employee Director Compensation
The Company's non-employee director compensation program maintained in 2018 reflected the recommendations of the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant based on the consultant's assessment of market competitiveness. The analysis included pay levels and prevalent practices for retainers, fees, equity-based compensation, and stock ownership guidelines, and affirmed that the Company's non-employee director compensation program is structured in a manner consistent with good governance, continues to be aligned with best practices, and meets the needs of the Board.
For 2018, each non-employee director received an annual cash retainer of $55,000 and an equity based award under our 2017 Incentive Stock Plan of Myers Industries, Inc., as Amended and Restated (the "2017 Plan") of $75.000. Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive any annual retainer. Director cash retainers are paid quarterly in arrears.
Until 2018, the equity based award was granted annually in arrears at the end of the non-employee directors' terms in connection with our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board agreed, to adopt a more customary practice of granting the equity based award at the beginning of the directors' terms upon election at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, subject to vesting on the first anniversary of the grant, conditioned on each director's continued service through the vesting date. Accordingly, in 2018 each non-employee director received an equity based award for their prior year of service which vested immediately, and an equity based award for their upcoming year of service which is subject to vesting at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The target value of each equity based award in 2018 was $75,000, based on the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Directors may elect to receive an equivalent number of stock units rather than shares of common stock, with payment to be made with respect to such stock unit when such director ceases to be a member of the Board. For non-employee directors who join the Board between annual meeting dates, the annual equity award is prorated for the portion of the term that such director serves.
The cash portions of our non-employee directors' annual, committee member, and committee chair retainers for 2018 is set forth below. In 2018, the Board established a Finance Committee as a temporary Ad-Hoc Board committee to provide oversight and guidance with respect to the Company's May 2018 public offering of 4,000,000 shares of its common stock. The Compensation Committee determined, and the Board approved, the annual retainers set forth below for participation in this and other future Ad Hoc committees, pro rated for the duration of service on such committees over a calendar year.

[END TABLE]
Overview
The main role and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee is to oversee our executive compensation plans and policies, administer our equity plans, and approve all compensation for our NEOs.
Compensation Philosophy 
The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's NEOs should be paid in a manner that attracts the best-available talent, drives performance, encourages an appropriate sensitivity to risk, and encourages and rewards increases in shareholder value. This philosophy is achieved through the Company's base salary, annual bonus opportunity, long-term incentive plan and other benefits, which are described in greater detail later in this Proxy Statement. Myers Industries' NEOs are compensated in a manner consistent with the Company's strategy, competitive practice, sound compensation governance principles, and shareholder interests.
The Compensation Committee's goals are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain talented and experienced executives and other key employees whose knowledge, skills and performance are crucial to our success 
• Ensure that the actual compensation paid to our executive officers correlates with financial performance  ("pay for performance") 
• Motivate our executive officers to pursue, and reward them for achieving, short-term and long-term Company goals that are intended to deliver shareholder value 
[END TABLE]
 Our Strategy and Pay for Performance Approach to Executive Compensation 
The Company's mission is to instill a culture where safety and efficiency are part of every aspect of the business and where employees are empowered to act like owners.  The Company has developed a long-term strategic vision for the Company, guided by three key operating principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Niche market focus 
• Flexible operations through the use of an asset-light business model 
• Strong cash flow growth 
[END TABLE]
The Company's compensation program is designed to compensate the Company's NEOs in a manner consistent with the Company's mission and near and long-term strategic vision. The Company's compensation program seeks to achieve this through the mixture of base pay, short and long-term incentives, and the provision of other benefits.  Base pay and other benefits provide appropriate compensation to attract and retain talent. Short-term incentives are tied to the achievement of Company growth with targets intended to advance the long-term strategic vision of the Company. Long-term incentives, which in 2018 comprised approximately 40-60% of our NEOs' compensation and which are primarily comprised of equity awards, provide executives with an ownership stake in the Company (emphasizing the "act like owners" principle of the Company) and help drive long-term shareholder value creation. Further, long-term incentive awards are based on performance metrics (EBITDA and free cash flow as a percentage of sales) that support the achievement of the Company's operating principles. 
Performance Highlights and Key Achievements in 2018
In 2018, we continued to execute on our strategy centered on a niche market focus, flexible operations through the use of an asset-light business model, and strong cash flow growth. As a result, we achieved the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Generated double-digit year-over-year sales growth in our Food & Beverage market, leading to an increase in net sales of 6.6% in our Material Handling Segment and 3.6% overall 
• Launched a new product in our Consumer market that is expected to drive mid-single-digit sales growth in that market in 2019 
• Expanded our gross margin by 280 basis points to 31.6% as a result of pricing initiatives and 80/20 and lean continuous improvement actions, combined with the benefits of the strategic footprint realignment that we completed in 2017 
• Improved adjusted operating income from $31.5 million in 2017 to $40.4 million in 2018, a 28.5% increase (excluding $33.3 million of charges related to the 2015 sale of the Company's Lawn and Garden business) 
• Reduced total debt by $74.2 million, or 49.2% 
• Reduced our leverage ratio to 1.2x as defined by our current debt agreements 
• Increased cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations by 22.9% to $60.4 million, driven by a reduction in working capital of $5.9 million, or 21.6%, despite higher sales 
• Completed public offering of 4.6 million shares of our common stock at $18.50 per share with net proceeds of approximately $79.5 million. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, we also announced a set of strategic transformation actions for our Distribution segment. The actions are expected to be implemented by the end of 2019 and include a new go-to-market strategy, a contribution margin improvement initiative, and an overhead and logistics optimization plan. The goal of the transformation is to reach a 10% EBITDA margin run-rate in 2020. As a result of these business and financial achievements, the highlights of our 2018 NEO compensation program were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement of Performance Objectives: Incentive payouts were commensurate with the business and financial achievements described above: 
• Based on the Company's adjusted operating income growth in 2018 of 28.5% compared to the growth goals of 8.0% at target and 23.0% at maximum, incentive awards under our 2018 Incentive Plan were earned at 200.0% of the targeted level for the CEO and at 200.0%% of the targeted level for the other NEOs.  
• For the Company's long-term incentive program three-year performance period ending in 2018, the Company achieved a one-year ROIC of 13% and a three-year average ROIC of 10.7% which, based on the target level of 13.7%, resulted in vesting of our long-term incentive awards at 70% of the three year targeted level. 
• Revised Long-Term Performance Metrics and Awards: Beginning with the three-year performance cycle ending in 2019, long-term incentive performance will be determined using three-year cumulative EBITDA and three-year total free cash flow as a percentage of sales, with each metric weighted at 50%. Additionally, the long-term incentive awards for such performance period are comprised solely of forms of equity (performance restricted stock units, stock options, and time-based restricted stock units)

Elements of Compensation for 2018
Our executive compensation program consists of several elements designed to provide an integrated and competitive total pay package: base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives and benefits.  A majority of the compensation package for NEOs is performance-based and the metrics are focused on paying for growth. Description of Compensation Elements 
Our 2018 executive compensation program was designed to reinforce the relationship between the interests of our NEOs and our shareholders and is comprised of three primary components: base pay (salary), annual cash bonus and long-term incentives.  The objectives and key characteristics of each element of our 2018 executive compensation are summarized below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Type of Pay & Form       Performance Periods       Objectives   
  Type of Pay & Form       Performance Periods       Objectives   
 Fixed     Base Pay (cash)     1 year• Compensation for job performance 
• Recognizes individual skills, competencies, and experience 
• Generally determined based on an individual's time in the position, experience, performance, future potential, external market conditions, and peer benchmarking 
• May be influenced/changed as a result of changes in the executive's responsibilities, an assessment of annual performance, our financial ability to pay base salaries and provide increases, and/or external market data relating to base pay practices of peers 
 At Risk     Annual Bonus (cash)     1 year• Variable cash compensation tied to the achievement of annual corporate operational goals (the Company's adjusted operating income growth and three-year average ROIC) established by the Compensation Committee each fiscal year to support long-term value creation 
• Aligns interests of executives with shareholders, with amount earned dependent on Company performance objectives designed to enhance shareholder value 
    Long-Term Incentives (performance stock unit awards, stock options, and restricted stock unit awards)     3 years• Motivates and rewards leaders for increasing shareholder value and returns while promoting our long-term interests by aiding in the retention of high-quality executives 
• Reflects the belief that a significant component of executive compensation should be at risk where the amount earned depends on achieving Company performance objectives (the Company's three-year cumulative EBITDA and three-year total free cash flow as a percentage of sales) designed to enhance shareholder value 
• Helps build executive stock ownership, consistent with our stock ownership objectives 
• Encourages retention through multi-year vesting 
[END TABLE]
 NEO Target Compensation Mix 
We believe in linking pay for performance.  The following graphs indicate the percentage of each NEO's total target direct compensation that is attributable to base salary, target bonus, and target long-term incentives. For Mr. Anversa the percentages shown were applicable during his service as Chief Financial Officer through December 11, 2018, for Mr. Brackman the percentages shown are as adjusted effective December 11, 2018 in connection with his appointment as Chief Financial Officer, and for Ms. Horton, the percentages shown are those effective for 2019 -- Ms. Horton did not receive any long-term incentive awards in 2018 due to her employment commencement date of October 8, 2018.  How Compensation is Determined
The Company believes its practices are consistent with the practices of a company of its size, reflect best practices regarding the governance of executive pay programs and reflect the executive pay program's objectives of delivering competitive and appropriate pay aligned with our shareholders' interests.
The Compensation Committee refers to market data to benchmark and help establish pay opportunities for the NEOs that are competitive for a company of our size in our industry, and for the role and experience of the individual executive. The Compensation Committee generally considers a range around the market median when establishing compensation levels for the NEOs. 
As part of its annual review and consideration of the benchmarking process used to assess the Company's pay levels and pay programs for its executives, the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant conduct an executive compensation market analysis that draws from third-party compensation surveys and publicly available data for a group of peer companies. For fiscal 2018, the compensation peer group was developed with consideration to various quantitative and qualitative criteria, including: (1) companies within 1/3x to 3x the Company's revenue, (2) companies operating within the Company's industries and end-markets, and (3) companies with similar focus and/or business complexity. Our Compensation Committee regards the Company's comparison to these companies as reference points only because finding direct publicly-traded peers within the lower end of our revenue range is difficult and does not seek to establish any specific benchmark in reference to these companies or to require changes in our executive compensation to match changes in these companies' compensation.
This peer group will continue to be used for executive compensation benchmarking purposes for fiscal year 2019.

 Consistent with the objectives of our executive pay philosophy of attracting and retaining talented and experienced executives and other key employees, paying for performance, motivating our executive officers to achieve short-term and long-term Company goals that will increase shareholder value and rewarding executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are crucial to our success, actual compensation may be above or below the median for executives in similar roles at companies of similar size and complexity, depending on an evaluation of several factors including, but not limited to, time-in-position, experience, performance, and future potential. We believe this approach is appropriate as it attracts and retains key executives, but does not position our compensation costs out of line with performance.
Compensation Elements in 2018
Base Salary
Base salary provides a fixed element of compensation that competitively rewards our NEOs' individual skills, competencies, experience and performance. Additionally, the base salaries provide our NEOs with income regardless of the Company's stock price performance, which acts as a risk-balancing measure in that it helps to avoid incentives to create short-term stock price fluctuations.  Furthermore, it helps mitigate elements beyond the control of the Company, like general economic and stock market conditions unrelated to Company performance.
The Company does not have written employment agreements with our NEOs. The Board and Compensation Committee annually review the performance of the CEO and the CEO's corporate goals and objectives and, in connection with this review, may recommend a merit-based increase to the CEO's base salary.  
For the other NEOs, base salary adjustments are based on recommendations by the CEO to the Compensation Committee.  In making such adjustments, the Company's performance and the individual NEO's scope of work, performance and competitive benchmarks are considered.  
In 2018, Mr. Brackman was the only NEO who received a base salary increase as shown in the table below. Neither Mr. Banyard nor Mr. Anversa received an increase in base salary in 2018 based on peer benchmarking. Ms. Horton's base salary was established at $375,000 upon her appointment as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary on October 8, 2018.

[END TABLE]
(1) Mr. Brackman's base salary increase included a 2.8% merit-based increase and a 3.1% adjustment upon the elimination of his eligibility to receive reimbursement for automobile related expenses. 
2018 Short-Term Incentives
The Company's annual incentive plan is a cash incentive plan in which our NEOs, alongside other senior level employees, participate.  The annual incentive plan is intended to reward management primarily for annual business growth that will help us achieve our long-term objectives.
Annual Bonus Performance Metrics
For 2018 annual bonuses, performance was determined using the following metric: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Measure  Alignment with Business Strategy  Weighting 
 Operating Income Growth  Operating income growth supports the Company's objective of cash flow growth and allows the Company to reward business performance  100% 
[END TABLE]
 Annual Bonus Performance – 2018 Objectives and Achievements
The Compensation Committee annually approves a target bonus opportunity for each NEO. Annual performance targets were established for achieving operating income growth.  As part of the annual bonus performance goal-setting process, the Board annually reviews and approves management's business and financial plan for the Company. The minimum and maximum ranges are intended to appropriately reward for results that exceed or fall short of target expectations. Bonuses can range from 0% to 200% of target, depending on actual performance, a practice that is consistent with the range of annual bonus opportunities of other companies our size. 
Goals are intended to reward for growth and business performance, consistent with the Company's strategy, and motivate management with additional compensation opportunities without encouraging excessive risk-taking.  We reward our executives with higher levels of cash compensation for results that substantially exceed target results. Conversely, we pay relatively lower levels of cash compensation for results that fail to meet minimally acceptable performance expectations.  
Our 2018 goals were set first by establishing that growth is a critical element of success.  As a step toward a long term trajectory in growth for 2018, the company set an 8% growth goal target and a 23% growth goal maximum.  To incentivize our team to provide growth, we also set a threshold of 0%, which is above our industry's historical performance level of -2% at the 25th percentile.
The following table illustrates the Company's 2018 adjusted operating income growth results and impact on the Company's annual incentive plan payout:

[END TABLE]
 Annual Bonus – 2019 Structure and Objectives
For the 2019 annual bonus plan, the Compensation Committee has determined to retain a single objective financial performance metric based on growth in operating income and has increased the goals for that metric to encourage continued corporate improvement consistent with the Company's business and financial plans. The plan goals for 2019 are 11.6% growth in operating income at target (100%), 34.0% growth at maximum (200%), and a 0% threshold (for maintaining our 2018 operating income level of $40.4 million). Our goal is to continue to drive above-market levels of growth, and the Company has determined that the targeted growth level exceeds comparable recent performance levels of our peer group. The Compensation Committee has also determined to reintroduce in 2019 a qualitative element for each named executive officer based on personal performance goals established for the executive at a weighting of 20% of each executive's total annual bonus opportunity. Payouts under this qualitative element will be based on evaluations of individual performance relative to each executive's qualitative performance goals also within a range of 0% to 200% for this element. The Committee well understands the need to align incentive compensation with objective financial performance, but also believes that including a qualitative element allows both the Committee and executive management to guide and assess continuous improvement in personal performance of the Company's leadership team.
2018 Long-Term Incentives
The Company's long-term incentive plan was established to, among other things, encourage management to drive long-term shareholder value and to align management's interests with shareholders' interests, emphasizing the "act like owners" principle of the Company. The long-term incentive plan is intended to motivate and reward leaders for increasing shareholder value and returns. The Company believes the Company's shareholders and employees are both best served by having our NEOs focused on and rewarded based on the achievement of longer-term results of the Company.  To accomplish this, the Board has, over the years, awarded a blend of stock options, service-based restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units, and performance-based long-term cash incentives to NEOs.  In particular, the use of stock options, service-based restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units are designed to meet specific reward objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% Weighting: Long-term performance restricted stock units are intended to reward our executives for achieving financial goals over a multi-year period. Long-term performance restricted stock units vest at the end of the three-year period and are based on the achievement of pre-established objectives over a three-year period 
• 30% Weighting: Stock options align our executives' interests with those of our shareholders because options only produce rewards to our executives if our stock price increases after options are granted. We believe options are performance-based awards, because the stock price appreciation that produces gains to the executive can generally be achieved if the Company's operating and financial results improve. In addition, options help build long-term executive stock ownership.  Stock options vest ratably on the first three anniversaries of the grant and are exercisable within ten years following their grant, consistent with our historical terms for option grants 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 20% Weighting: Service-based restricted stock unit grants help retain our key executives. Restricted stock units also align our executives to the total returns earned by our investors. Service-based restricted stock unit grants vest ratably over a three year period, are tied to continued service, and provide a strong device for retaining our executives 
[END TABLE]
The Company had previously included long-term performance cash awards in addition to the long-term equity awards.  Starting in 2017, the Company stopped granting long-term performance cash awards as part of its long-term incentive plan and moved to a long-term incentive award mix for executive management (including NEOs) solely comprised of equity awards (performance-based restricted stock units, stock options and restricted stock units).  However, certain NEOs may be entitled to payouts on long-term performance cash awards under prior performance periods that have not concluded.  Long-Term Performance Metrics
Prior to 2017, our long-term incentive performance metrics were based on a single metric. In 2017 the Compensation Committee revised the long-term incentive performance metrics (as described below).  These metrics were adopted to better align with the Company's strategy, drive consistent performance over time toward achieving objective financial metrics with strong alignment with shareholder value, and to more effectively correlate this performance to compensation. Additionally, these metrics are used by management to assess operating performance of the business.
The following table shows the performance periods for the Company's long-term incentive programs outstanding as of the end of 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Period  Grant Date  Settlement Date (If Earned)  Performance Measures (Weightings in%) 
 Performance Period  Grant Date  Settlement Date (If Earned)  Performance Measures (Weightings in%) 
 2016-2018  March 2016  2019  3-year average ROIC (100%) 
 2017-2019  March 2017  2020  3-year cumulative EBITDA (50%)  3-year total free cash flow as a% of sales (50%) 
 2018-2020  March 2018  2021  3-year cumulative EBITDA (50%)  3-year total free cash flow as a% of sales (50%) 
[END TABLE]
Once target values are developed, awards for each long-term element are based on an individual's position, experience, future potential, organizational level, scope of responsibilities, their ability to impact results, and any special recruiting and retention needs. For the NEOs, the Compensation Committee aimed to emphasize performance-based elements (long-term performance stock and cash incentives) and options over service-based elements (restricted stock units).   For the Company's NEOs, the following mix of target long-term incentives were set for 2018:
Long-Term Incentive Performance-Objectives and Achievements for the Three-Year Period Ended in 2018
For the three-year period ending in 2018, as described above, the Company established three-year ROIC performance objectives ranging from 8.7% (minimum) to 18.7% (maximum), with target results achieved at 13.7%.  The method for determining the corresponding awards are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):     Calculation of Award (Percentage of Target Award):

 18.7% or more     200%    
[END TABLE]
 Long-Term Incentive Plan – 2019 Structure and Objectives
For 2019, as the third year of the three-year cycle begun in 2017, the Compensation Committee has determined to continue the general structure of our long-term incentive plan consisting of 50% performance-based restricted stock units, with equally weighted metrics of three-year cumulative EBITDA and three-year total free cash flow as a percentage of sales, 30% stock options, and 20% time-based restricted stock units subject to pro rata three year vesting. The threshold, target and maximum goals established for the 2019 performance based awards exceed the levels of our 2017 and 2018 awards and will be disclosed upon the completion of the three-year performance period ending at December 31, 2021. These rigorous goals are intended to continue to drive the Company's continued growth and long-term financial success. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider, with input from Semler-Brossy, alternative performance metrics which align with shareholder interests for the performance-based component of the Company's long-term incentive plan for years after 2019.
Other Benefits
NEOs also participate in broad-based benefit plans that are available to all employees. These benefits are not tied to individual or Company performance, which is the same approach used for other employees. Moreover, changes to executives' benefits reflect the changes to the benefits of other employees.
The Company's NEOs participate in the following broad-based benefit plans that provide basic health, life and income security:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company maintains qualified and nonqualified retirement programs to provide our NEOs with the basic needs described above.  NEOs participate in our qualified retirement plan (a tax-qualified 401(k) plan, pursuant to which all participants are eligible to receive matching contributions from the Company) on the same terms as all of our other employees 
• Beginning in 2018, each of our NEOs is eligible to participate in the Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan, which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allows for deferrals above the IRS limits on qualified plans. This plan is intended to restore deferred compensation benefits that would have been earned under the tax-qualified 401(k) plan but for certain limitations imposed by the federal tax laws 
• NEOs also participate in broad-based benefit plans that are available to all employees, including health insurance and life and disability insurance

• Under the Stock Ownership Guidelines, our NEOs and non-employee directors are expected to hold a specified amount of our common stock.  These expectations are as follows: CEO: 5X annual base salary CFO and CLO: 3X annual base salary Vice Presidents: 1X annual base salary Non-Employee Directors: 5X annual cash Board retainer

• The NEOs and non-employee directors have five years from becoming subject to the guidelines to attain the ownership requirement 
• In determining stock ownership for purposes of our ownership guidelines, shares owned outright, including shares owned jointly with a spouse or separately by a spouse and/or children that live in the NEO's household, vested and unvested time-based restricted stock and stock unit awards, vested stock options, and non-employee deferred stock units, are counted 
 Accounting and  Tax Considerations• In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act") was signed into law. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as further amended by the 2017 Tax Act, restricts deductibility for federal income tax purposes of annual individual compensation in excess of $1 million to the NEOs, effective for tax years beginning after 2017, subject to a transition rule for written binding contracts which were in effect on November 2, 2017, and which were not modified in any material respect on or after such date

• Prior to the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act, Section 162(m)'s deductibility limitation was subject to an exception for compensation that qualified as "performance-based".  In 2013, our shareholders approved the Performance Bonus Plan which was designed to permit us to grant incentive awards that may qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code 
[END TABLE]
Risk Assessment of Compensation Practices
In the design and approval of the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers risks that may be inherent in such program. The Compensation Committee has designed the Company's compensation program to guard against excessive risk taking.  The following are some features of the compensation program that are designed to help the Company manage compensation-related risk:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Using a variety of vehicles for providing compensation, including salary, bonus, and equity-based compensation, comprised of cash and equity based incentives with different vesting periods, which act to focus executives on specific objectives under the Company's business plan while creating alignment with shareholders 
• Providing a mixture of fixed and variable, annual and long-term, and cash and equity compensation to encourage behavior and actions that are in the long-term interests of the Company and our shareholders 
• Placing an emphasis on performance-based awards more than service-based awards to further align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establishing, and reviewing on an annual basis, base salaries to be consistent with an employee's responsibilities 
• Diversifying incentive-based risk by using differing performance measures, including Company financial performance 
• Determining and awarding incentive award grants based on a review of multiple indicators of performance that diversify the risk associated with any single indicator of performance 
[END TABLE]
As a result, the Compensation Committee believes that the design of the Company's compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long‑term value of Myers Industries.

The Board is committed to upholding the highest legal and ethical conduct in fulfilling its responsibilities and recognizes that related party transactions can present a heightened risk of potential or actual conflicts of interest. Accordingly, it is our preference, as a general rule, to avoid related party transactions. No related party transactions occurred during fiscal year 2018.
Our Governance Committee reviews all relationships and transactions in which we and our directors, nominees for director and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. In addition, under Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and investigating any matters pertaining to our ethical codes of conduct, including conflicts of interest. CEO Pay Ratio
As a result of rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer (in the Company's case, the CEO).  In determining the median employee, a listing of all employees (the Company's full employee population, but excluding the CEO) as of December 17, 2018 was prepared and the Company applied a "consistently applied compensation measure" to determine the median employee.  For the consistently applied compensation measure, the Company looked to annual base salaries of employees for 2018.  We used an annual base salary as our consistently applied compensation measure as it represents the primary compensation component paid to all of our employees.  Non-U.S. employees were included in the determination of the median employee compensation, with the salary amounts of such non-U.S. employees converted to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of December 17, 2018.  
Mr. Banyard, the Company's CEO, had 2018 annual total compensation of $4,076,952, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.  The annual total compensation for 2018 of our median employee (other than the CEO) was calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table and determined to be $39,810.  Mr. Banyard's annual total compensation was approximately 102.41 times that of our median employee in 2018.
The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Myers Industries' directors, officers and persons who own more than ten percent of its common stock ("Section 16 Filers") to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and to furnish Myers Industries with copies of all such forms they file. These reports can be viewed on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. For the year ended December 31, 2018, based solely on the review of copies of reports furnished to us or written representations that no reports were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met in the last fiscal year by our Section 16 Filers. PROPOSAL NO. 3 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  In accordance with these responsibilities, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additional information regarding the services provided to the Company by EY during 2018 is set forth below, under the section titled "Matters Relating to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."
In selecting EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered a variety of factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The firm's independence and internal quality controls 
• The overall depth of talent 
• EY's experience with the Company's industry and companies of similar scale and size 
[END TABLE]
In determining whether to reappoint EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, the Audit Committee again took those factors into consideration along with its evaluation of the past performance of EY and EY's familiarity with the Company's business and internal control over financial reporting. EY's audit report appears in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
In accordance with SEC rules and EY policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide audit service to our company. For lead and concurring review audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the lead audit partner under this rotation policy involves discussions with EY regarding qualified audit experience and ability to devote the time necessary to serve as lead audit partner. The current EY lead audit partner at EY for the Company was appointed in 2017.
The Audit Committee believes that the continued retention of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders and, although shareholder ratification is not required under the laws of the State of Ohio, we are asking shareholders to ratify the selection of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, in order to provide a means by which our shareholders may communicate their opinions to the Audit Committee. If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment, but is not obligated to change the appointment, and may for other reasons be unable to make another appointment.

EY is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's annual financial statements and expressing an opinion on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The conformity, in all material respects, of the Company's financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and 
• The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
[END TABLE]
Each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and independent as defined under the Board of Directors Independence Criteria policy and the independence standards set by the NYSE for both directors and audit committee members.  The Board has identified each of F. Jack Liebau, Jr. (ex officio), Lori Lutey, Jane Scaccetti and Robert A. Stefanko as an "audit committee financial expert."
The Audit Committee's responsibility is one of oversight. Members of the Audit Committee rely on the information provided and the representations made to them by management, which has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control over financial reporting, and for the Company's financial statements and reports; and by the independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for performing an audit in accordance with Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board — United States ("PCAOB") and expressing an opinion on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The conformity, in all material respects, of the Company's financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America  
• The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
[END TABLE]
In the performance of our duties we have:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 
• Discussed with EY, among other matters, the fair and complete presentation of the Company's results, the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, significant accounting policies applied in the Company's financial statements, as well as, when applicable, alternative accounting treatments and the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16 (PCAOB 2012-01) and the rules of the SEC 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Received the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Rule 3526 regarding EY's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with EY its independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from the Company   
• The Audit Committee also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from the Company and its management 
[END TABLE]
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and exercising our business judgment, we recommended to the Board that the financial statements referred to above be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have selected EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, and have approved submitting the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the shareholders.
The foregoing report has been furnished by the current members of the Audit Committee, being:

Shareholder Proposals for Inclusion in Proxy Statement

[BEGIN TABLE]

• Not earlier than January 23, 2020 and not later than February 22, 2020 (subject to announcement of the Annual Meeting date, as described below) if the proposal is submitted pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Code of Regulations 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with our Amended and Restated Code of Regulations, a shareholder may submit notice of a shareholder proposal that it intends to raise at our Annual Meeting (and not desiring to be included in the Company's proxy statement) only if advance written notice of such intention is received by the Secretary not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such Annual Meeting of shareholders. In the event that the date of such meeting is not publicly disclosed at least seventy (70) days prior to the date of such meeting, written notice of such shareholder's intent to submit a proposal must be received by the Secretary not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first provided to the shareholders. A shareholder wishing to submit a shareholder proposal must follow the procedure outlined in Article I, Section 11 of our Amended and Restated Code of Regulations, titled "Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals" and then send a signed letter of proposal to the following address: Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, c/o Secretary, Myers Industries, Inc., 1293 South Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44301. The Company disclosed the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting on February 12, 2019, and received no proposals satisfying the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or the Company's Amended and Restated Code of Regulations. The Company intends to hold its 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 22, 2020.
The submission of such a notice does not ensure that a proposal can be raised at our Annual Meeting.
Incorporation by Reference
The Compensation Committee Report and the Audit Committee Report (including reference to the independence of the Audit Committee members) are not deemed filed with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any prior or future filings made by us under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate such information by reference. The section of this proxy entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" is specifically incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of Proxy Solicitation
The accompanying proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the Board, whose notice of meeting is attached to this Proxy Statement, and the entire cost of such solicitation will be borne by Myers Industries. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview and telephone by directors, officers and employees of Myers Industries. Arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons, and Myers Industries will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection therewith. 
Copy of the Form 10-K
Although a copy of the Annual Report on Form 10-K is provided to you at the time of delivery of the definitive Proxy Statement, we will mail without charge, upon written request, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, including the consolidated financial statements, schedules and list of exhibits, and any particular exhibit specifically requested. Requests should be sent to: Myers Industries, Inc., 1293 South Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44301, Attn: Investor Relations. The Annual Report on Form 10-K is also available at www.myersindustries.com and at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Notice Regarding Delivery of Security Holder Documents
The SEC now permits companies to send a single set of annual disclosure documents to any household at which two or more shareholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the Company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, such shareholders continue to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This "householding" process reduces the volume of duplicate information and reduces printing and mailing expenses. We have not instituted householding for shareholders of record; however, a number of brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of the Company's shares of common stock held through such brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of common stock of the Company, you already may have received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of the annual disclosure documents. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this Proxy Statement or our Annual Report promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
