On behalf of the Board of Directors and management team, we cordially invite you to attend Northrop Grumman Corporation's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This year's meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 15, 2019 at our principal executive office located at 2980 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, Virginia 22042 beginning at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time.
We look forward to meeting those of you who are able to attend the meeting. For those who are unable to attend, live coverage of the meeting will be available on the Northrop Grumman website at www.northropgrumman.com.
At this meeting, shareholders will vote on matters set forth in the accompanying Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement. We will also provide a report on our Company and will entertain questions of general interest to the shareholders.
2018 was another year of strong performance for our Company. Our acquisition of Orbital ATK in June added a new, fourth business sector to our Company, Innovation Systems, which was immediately accretive to earnings and enhanced our position in the critical space and missile defense domains. Sales rose 16%, operating income increased 17%, and our businesses generated a 19% increase in segment operating profit*. We also generated higher net earnings and earnings per share. These results reflect the addition of Innovation Systems and strong performance from our three legacy Northrop Grumman sectors.  
Our capital deployment strategy continues to create shareholder value. In addition to acquiring Orbital ATK, we maintained robust capital expenditures to drive innovation and affordability for our customers. We reduced debt by $2.3 billion, made voluntary contributions to our pension funds, and distributed $2.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We increased our dividend twice, totaling approximately 20%. We repurchased $1.3 billion in shares, and early in January, we completed the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase we commenced in 2018, retiring 3.84 million shares at an average price of approximately $260 per share.
In 2018, we also announced an important leadership transition. Kathy Warden, who joined Northrop Grumman in 2008, and has assumed positions of increasing responsibility in critical national security domains since then, was elected to the Board of Directors in July and assumed the CEO role this January. Ms. Warden's deep knowledge and experience, along with her demonstrated leadership across multiple Northrop Grumman businesses, make her particularly well qualified to support the achievement of our Company's many value creation opportunities. Mr. Bush continues as Chair of the Board until July 31, 2019.
We also continue to strengthen our corporate citizenship and sustainability efforts with leading environmental, social and governance practices. Female representation on our Board has increased to more than 30%. We received a Catalyst Award for the significant progress the Company made to increase the number of women and women of color in leadership positions over a sustained period from 2010-2016. Over this period, women on our senior executive team increased from 8% in 2010 to 46% in 2016, and at the vice president level from 15% to 29% over the same time period. DiversityInc named us one of their Top 50 Companies for Diversity for the ninth consecutive year. For the seventh consecutive year, Northrop Grumman earned a leadership score in CDP's 2018 climate change program. We were again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America and we also achieved the highest ESG scores from the proxy advisor, ISS. 
In 2018, as in prior years, we actively engaged with our shareholders on a variety of matters, including our strategy for long-term value creation, and ensuring our governance, compensation and sustainability practices are well designed to support long-term profitability growth and value creation.  
Your vote is important. Your proxy or voting instruction card includes specific information regarding the several ways to vote your shares. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible, even if you plan to attend the meeting. You may vote over the internet, by telephone or mobile device, by mailing a proxy or voting instruction card or in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Thank you for your support and continued interest in Northrop Grumman Corporation.

2018 Performance Highlights (page 38) 
[END TABLE]
Our focus on performance, portfolio and capital deployment continues to strengthen our foundation for long-term profitable growth and create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
2018 was another year of strong performance for our Company. We strengthened our alignment with critical national security missions with the acquisition of Orbital ATK in June. This added a new, fourth business sector, Innovation Systems. Strong performance from our three legacy Northrop Grumman sectors, along with the contribution of our new sector, drove a 16% sales increase, a 17% increase in operating income, and a 19% increase in segment operating income*. 2018 diluted earnings per share increased to $18.49. We also announced the adoption of the mark-to-market (MTM) method of accounting for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Beginning with our fourth quarter 2018 financial results, we are presenting MTM-adjusted earnings* and MTM-adjusted diluted earnings per share* as a supplemental financial measure for measuring the Company's underlying financial performance. MTM-adjusted earnings per share* increased more than 50% to $21.33. 
Our operations continued to generate strong cash flow. Cash provided by operations increased $1.2 billion to more than $3.8 billion, and free cash flow* increased by approximately $900 million to $2.6 billion. Our strong cash generation enabled us to continue deploying cash for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and employees. In 2018, our capital expenditures totaled $1.2 billion and we invested $764 million in R&D. Our capital expenditures continue to be elevated as we invest to strengthen the foundation for long-term profitable growth and drive affordability for our customers. 
We continued to return cash to shareholders. In October 2018, we commenced a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR), which was completed in January 2019. This transaction retired 3.84 million shares of our stock at an average price of approximately $260 per share. 2018 share repurchases totaled $1.3 billion. We also announced two dividend increases, which in total increased our quarterly dividend by 20% to $1.20 per share.
In July 2018, after robust and extended succession planning, the Board of Directors elected Kathy Warden to our Board and announced that she would succeed Wesley Bush as CEO, beginning on January 1, 2019. After serving nine years in the CEO role, Mr. Bush remains Chair of the Board until July 31, 2019.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights (page 37) 
[END TABLE]
We are committed to performance-based executive compensation programs that align with shareholders' interests and our strategy of investing for and delivering long-term profitable growth.
Due to strong financial performance in 2018, our 2018 Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) payout increased to 160%, from 131% in 2017. Our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) payout is 115% compared to 150% in 2017 for named executive officers (NEOs). We ranked in the 45th percentile for three-year TSR performance relative to the 2016 Performance Peer Group identified on page 42, ranked in the 64th percentile for three-year TSR performance relative to the S&P Industrials and exceeded our target for Cumulative Free Cash Flow* (Cumulative FCF*).

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Governance Highlights (pages 14-24)  
Board Structure and Governance   โ The Board is approximately 85% independent.  
  โ Each of the Audit, Compensation, Governance and Policy Committees is comprised entirely of independent directors.   
  โ Our policy limits the number of boards on which our directors serve (no more than three other public company boards without special approval) to avoid overboarding. 
  โ The independent directors regularly hold both executive sessions led by our Chairperson and independent sessions led by our Lead Independent Director. 
  โ Our Lead Independent Director, appointed annually by the independent directors, is empowered with a robust set of responsibilities and provides additional independent oversight of senior management and Board leadership.  
  โ All directors are elected annually based on a majority voting standard in uncontested elections, with a director resignation policy if a director fails to receive a majority of votes cast "for" his or her election. 
  โ The Board nominees reflect a balanced mix of directors with deep Company and industry knowledge, and fresh and diverse perspectives, with an average director tenure of 6.5 years. 
  โ The Board and each Committee annually conduct a thorough self-assessment process focused on Board or Committee performance, respectively. In addition, each director completes an individual director evaluation for each of the other directors and receives feedback on his or her own performance.   
  โ We have a director retirement policy for directors who reach the age of 75 and are committed to Board refreshment, with the addition of five new directors to the Board in the last five years. 
  โ Three of our directors - Marianne Brown, Ann Fudge and Madeleine Kleiner - have been honored by Women's Inc. as three of the most influential corporate directors of 2018. 
  โ One of our directors - William Hernandez - has been recognized by a local chapter of the NACD with a leadership in corporate governance award in 2018. 
Shareholder Rights   โ The Board has adopted a robust proxy access bylaw provision, allowing eligible shareholders to include their own director nominees in the Company's proxy materials. 
  โ Shareholders holding at least 25% of our common stock have the right to call a special meeting. 
  โ Shareholders holding at least 25% of our common stock have the right to take action by written consent. 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability   โ We have a strong ethics program with standards of business conduct that help guide and promote good governance, responsible business practices and the highest standards of integrity throughout the Company. 
  โ We have robust programs to fulfill our commitment to diversity and inclusion throughout the Company. 
  โ We publish an annual corporate responsibility report highlighting aspects of our social, environmental and governance performance and engage an independent external review panel to provide feedback and advice on our report. 
  โ We integrate environmental sustainability into our organizational culture, minimizing our environmental footprint and driving affordability. Our executive officers are accountable for achieving environmental sustainability goals, which are one of our six non-financial corporate performance metrics.   
  โ We disclose our political contributions policy and various trade association memberships on our website.   
  โ We have a robust recoupment policy which provides the Board of Directors with the ability to recoup the incentive compensation of elected officers under certain circumstances. 
Stock Ownership    โ We have stock ownership guidelines of 7x base salary for the CEO and 3x base salary for other named executive officers, as well as stock holding requirements of three years from the vesting date. 
  โ We have stock ownership guidelines of 5x the annual cash retainer for our non-employee directors. 
  โ We prohibit hedging and pledging of our common stock by directors and executive officers.

Shareholder Engagement 
[END TABLE]
We regularly engage with our shareholders to understand their perspectives on our Company, including our strategies, performance, issues of governance and corporate responsibility, and executive compensation. This ongoing dialogue, in which both members of management and directors participate, has helped inform the Board's decision-making and ensure our interests remain well-aligned with those of our shareholders.
Since our 2018 annual meeting, we have offered to engage on governance-related topics with shareholders representing approximately 60% of our outstanding shares. We have met with shareholders representing more than 40% of our outstanding shares to learn their perspectives on the Company and governance-related topics. While a number of our shareholders did not request meetings, we believe it is a best practice to offer engagement to shareholders representing a majority of our shares outstanding. These efforts are in addition to normal course outreach conducted by our Investor Relations team and members of senior management with portfolio managers and analysts, which are primarily focused on strategy and Company performance. We also meet with shareholders at investor conferences held throughout the year.
The Company has a substantial record of adopting provisions or modifying practices with the benefit of, and to reflect, shareholder input. Examples include provisions regarding proxy access, the right of shareholders to call a special meeting and the right of shareholders to act by written consent, as well as the use of full value shares and performance-based long-term incentives for our executives.

2019 Nominees for Director 
[END TABLE]
Our Board has nominated 13 directors for election at the Annual Meeting. Each of the director nominees has consented to serve, and we do not know of any reason why any of them would be unable to serve, if elected. If a nominee becomes unavailable or unable to serve before the Annual Meeting (for example, due to serious illness), the Board may determine to leave the position vacant, reduce the number of authorized directors or designate a substitute nominee. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election to the Board, an event which is not anticipated, the proxyholders will have full discretion and authority to vote, or refrain from voting, for any other nominee in accordance with their judgment.
The following pages contain biographical and other information about each of the nominees. In addition, we have provided information regarding some of the particular experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Board to conclude that each nominee should serve as a director.
Unless instructed otherwise, the proxyholders will vote the proxies received by them "FOR" the election of the director nominees listed below.

Board's Role in Risk Oversight
As noted above, the Board is responsible for overseeing our risk management activities, among other duties. Each of our Board committees assists the Board in this role. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข The Audit Committee focuses on risks that could impact our financial performance. The Audit Committee periodically receives a report from the Chief Financial Officer and members of the Finance Department addressing our financial risk management processes, systems and internal controls, the nature of the material financial risks the Company faces and how the Company responds to and mitigates these risks. The Audit Committee periodically receives a report from our General Counsel on legal and other compliance risks and how the Company is addressing and mitigating those risks. The Audit Committee receives an annual report from our Chief Compliance Officer on the Company's compliance program overall. The Audit Committee also receives quarterly reports from the Vice President, Global Corporate Responsibility on trends in ethics reporting. 
โข The Compensation Committee reviews at least annually a risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs and, together with its independent compensation consultant, evaluates the mix of at-risk compensation linked to stock appreciation.  
โข The Policy Committee assists the Board in identifying and evaluating global security, political, public relations, environmental sustainability and budgetary issues and trends that could impact the Company's business. The Policy Committee periodically receives a report from the Vice President, Global Corporate Responsibility on the Company's ethics and corporate responsibility programs. 
โข The Governance Committee regularly reviews the Company's policies and practices on issues of corporate governance, and considers issues of succession and composition of the Board, recommending proposed changes to the full Board for approval. 
[END TABLE]
The Board and its Committees provide oversight of the Company's risk management processes, including the Enterprise Risk Management Council (ERMC). The ERMC is comprised of all members of the Corporate Policy Council, the Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Corporate Secretary, head of Internal Audit and Treasurer. The ERMC seeks to ensure that the Company has identified the most significant risks and implemented effective mitigation plans for each. The full Board has responsibility for oversight of cyber and other security risks, and receives periodic briefings from our Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Leadership Structure 
[END TABLE]
Chairperson of the Board
Our Bylaws provide that our directors will designate a Chairperson of the Board from among its members. The Chairperson presides at all Board and shareholder meetings. The Chairperson interacts directly with all members of the Board and assists the Board to fulfill its responsibilities. As the Principles of Corporate Governance provide, the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders for the Board to have flexibility to determine the best director to serve as Chairperson of the Board at the time, based on consideration of all relevant factors.
Following our 2018 Annual Meeting the Board reviewed its leadership structure and determined that the appropriate leadership structure at the time was for Mr. Bush, who was then our Chief Executive Officer, to continue to serve as Chairman. The Board concluded that having our Chief Executive Officer serve as Chairman was an appropriate leadership structure for the Company and best positioned the Company to be innovative, compete successfully, present one face to our customer and advance shareholder interests in today's environment. The Board continues to believe that Mr. Bush's deep understanding of the Company's business, day-to-day operations, growth opportunities, challenges and risk management practices gained through various leadership positions enables him to provide strong and effective leadership to the Board and to ensure that the Board is informed of important issues facing the Company. The Board consists entirely of independent directors, other than Mr. Bush and Ms. Warden, and continues to exercise a strong, independent oversight function, with fully independent Board Committees and a strong Lead Independent Director with clearly articulated responsibilities.
In July 2018, the Board elected Ms. Warden to the position of Chief Executive Officer and President, effective January 1, 2019, and elected Ms. Warden to the Board, effective July 12, 2018. The Board determined that Mr. Bush should continue as Chairman of the Board through July 2019, when he will retire from the Company. As required by the Company's Principles of Corporate Governance, Mr. Bush has stated his intent to submit his resignation to the Board of Directors effective upon his retirement from the Company. The Board will continue to review and discuss the leadership structure of the Board and determine the leadership structure, including the Chairperson, that continues best to meet the needs of the Company.

All the committees are composed entirely of independent directors. The primary responsibilities of each of the committees are summarized below, together with a table listing the membership and chairperson of each committee.

Board Meetings and Executive Sessions 
[END TABLE]
The Board meets no fewer than nine times each year (including via telephonic meetings). Special meetings of the Board may be called from time to time as appropriate. On an annual basis, the Board holds an extended meeting to review our long-term strategy.
The Board holds its meetings at Company locations other than our corporate headquarters on a regular basis to provide the directors with a first-hand view of different elements of our business and an opportunity to interact with local management.
The Board meets in executive session (with the directors only and then with the independent directors only) following each in-person Board meeting and on other occasions as needed. The non-executive Chairperson or the Lead Independent Director presides over the executive sessions of the independent directors. The Audit Committee meets in executive session at each in-person Audit Committee meeting, and regularly requests separate executive sessions with representatives of our independent auditor and our senior management, including our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and our Vice President, Internal Audit. The Compensation Committee also meets in executive session from time to time and regularly receives a report from the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. The Governance and Policy Committees also meet in executive session as they deem necessary.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Meeting Attendance 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, the Board held 10 meetings. Each incumbent director serving in 2018 attended 75% or more of the total number of Board and committee meetings he or she was eligible to attend. Board members are expected to attend each annual meeting, except where the failure to attend is due to unavoidable circumstances. All of our then-serving directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Independence 
[END TABLE]
The Board has established an objective that at least 75% of our directors be independent directors. The Board and the Governance Committee annually review the relevant relationships or arrangements between the Company and our directors or parties related to the directors in determining whether such directors are independent. No director is considered independent unless the Board has determined that the director meets the independence requirements under applicable New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and SEC rules and under our categorical independence standards, which are described in our Principles of Corporate Governance. For a director to be considered independent, the Board must determine that a director has no material relationship with the Company other than as a director.
Our Principles of Corporate Governance provide that a director may be found not to qualify as an independent director if the director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข has within the prior three years been a director, executive officer or trustee of a charitable organization that received annual contributions from the Company exceeding the greater of $1 million or 2% of the charitable organization's annual gross revenues, where the gifts were not normal matching charitable gifts, did not go through normal corporate charitable donation approval processes or were made "on behalf of" a director; 
โข has, or has an immediate family member who has, within the prior three years been employed by, a partner in or otherwise affiliated with any law firm or investment bank in which the director's or the immediate family member's compensation was contingent on the services performed for the Company or in which the director or the immediate family member personally performed services for the Company and the annual fees paid by the Company during the preceding fiscal year exceeded the greater of $1 million or 2% of the gross annual revenues of such firm; or 
โข has, or has an immediate family member who has, within the prior three years owned, either directly or indirectly as a partner, shareholder or officer of another company, more than 5% of the equity of an organization that has a material business relationship with (including significant purchasers of goods or services), or more than 5% ownership in, the Company.

Independence Determination 
In connection with their annual independence review, the Board and Governance Committee considered the following relationships with organizations to which we have made payments or from which we have received payments in the usual course of our business in 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Mr. Felsinger's service as a member of the Board of Directors of Archer-Daniels-Midland; 
โข Mr. Gordon's service as a member of the Board of Directors of CBS Corporation; 
โข Mr. Hernandez's service as a member of the Board of Directors of Albemarle Corporation; 
โข Admiral Roughead's service as a member of the Board of Directors of the Center for a New American Security, a trustee of Johns Hopkins University and a member of the Board of Managers of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab;  
โข Mr. Schoewe's service as a member of the Board of Directors of General Motors; and 
โข Mr. Turley's service as a member of the Board of Directors of Citigroup and Emerson Electric. 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors considered that Ms. Fudge, Mr. Gordon, Ms. Kleiner, Mr. Turley and General Welsh served as members of the boards of, or are otherwise affiliated with, organizations to which the Company and/or the Northrop Grumman Foundation (Foundation) made contributions during 2018 in the usual course of our charitable contributions program, as well as in connection with our matching gifts program (which limits the contributions to $10,000 per year per director). The amounts paid were below the applicable thresholds under NYSE rules and our Principles of Corporate Governance. 
Following its review and the recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board affirmatively determined that all of the directors, except Mr. Bush and Ms. Warden, are independent. The independent directors constitute approximately 85% of the members of our Board. The Board previously determined that Victor H. Fazio, who served as a director until his retirement from the Board effective the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting, was independent during the time he was a director. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Election Process 
[END TABLE]
Our Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation provide for the annual election of directors. Each director will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Generally, in order to be elected, a director must receive more votes cast "for" than "against" his or her election, unless one or more shareholders provide notice of an intention to nominate one or more candidates to compete with the Board's nominees for election in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company's corporate governance documents.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Composition and Director Nominations 
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee actively considers the composition and diversity of the Board to ensure it is well positioned to serve the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. The Governance Committee regularly assesses what skills, experiences and other attributes can best contribute to the effective operation of the Board, particularly in light of the evolving needs of the Company. The Governance Committee identifies director candidates from a wide range of sources and may employ a third-party search firm to assist in the process.  
The Governance Committee evaluates potential director candidates on the basis of the candidate's background, qualifications and experience. The Governance Committee carefully considers whether each potential candidate would be able to fulfill his or her duties to the Company consistent with Delaware law and the Company's governing documents, including the Principles of Corporate Governance. The Committee recommends to the full Board nominees for election. 
Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Governance Committee pursuant to our Principles of Corporate Governance. The Governance Committee considers such director candidates recommended by shareholders similarly to other potential director candidates brought to the attention of the Governance Committee. Shareholder recommendations for director candidates under our Principles of Corporate Governance must be addressed to the Governance Committee in care of the Corporate Secretary. In addition, and as discussed immediately below, shareholders may also directly nominate director candidates in accordance with our Bylaws.

The Board carefully considered and adopted a strong and balanced proxy access framework  
For more than a year, the Board carefully considered the issue of proxy access. The Board and management engaged extensively with shareholders and monitored developments and best practices regarding proxy access. Management solicited and received input from shareholders, our customers and other stakeholders. The Board amended our Bylaws to provide our shareholders the right to proxy access, reflecting this extensive consideration and input.
Under the Company's proxy access bylaws, a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, that has maintained continuous ownership of 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock for at least three years may include in the Company's proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two nominees or nominees constituting 20% of the number of directors in office. Director nominees may receive compensation from third parties for their candidacy, up to the total annual compensation paid to directors of the Company, as well as reimbursement for reasonable expenses, provided there is full disclosure of such compensation. Under the Company's bylaw provisions, directors are treated similarly, whether nominated through proxy access or otherwise, and held to the same high fiduciary standards to serve all shareholders.  
The Company's Bylaws provide our shareholders with broad and meaningful access to the Company's proxy materials while enhancing transparency, protecting the interests of all shareholders and ensuring good governance. The terms of the Company's proxy access bylaw provisions are also broadly consistent with the terms of proxy access bylaws adopted by other Fortune 500 companies, reflecting best practices.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Qualifications 
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee is responsible for establishing the criteria for Board membership. In nominating directors, the Governance Committee bears in mind that the foremost responsibility of a director is to represent the interests of our shareholders as a whole. The activities and associations of candidates are reviewed for any legal impediment, conflict of interest or other consideration that might prevent or interfere with service on our Board.
In evaluating candidates, the Governance Committee considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the personal integrity and the professional reputation of the individual; 
โข the education, professional background and particular skills and experience most beneficial to service on our Board;  
โข how the nominee brings diversity, experience and skills valuable to the Company and Board at the time; and  
โข whether a director candidate is willing to submit to and obtain a background check necessary for obtaining and retaining a top secret security clearance. 
[END TABLE]
In evaluating director candidates, the Governance Committee aims to foster diversity of thought on our Board. The Governance Committee seeks to ensure diversity, including in race and gender, as well as in perspective, professional experience, education, skill and other qualities that contribute to our Board and the long-term interests of our Company and shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Orientation and Continuing Education  
[END TABLE]
All new directors to the Board receive in-person orientation and training that is individually tailored, taking into account the director's experience, background, education and committee assignments. The orientation program is led by members of senior management and covers a review of our strategy and operating plans, financial statements, corporate governance and key policies and practices, as well as the roles and responsibilities of our directors. 
All directors receive regular in-person training regarding our Company policies and procedures, and broad exposure to our operations and the teams. Members of senior management review with the Board the operating plan for each of our business sectors and the Company as a whole. The Board also conducts periodic site visits to our facilities as part of its regularly scheduled Board meetings. These visits allow directors to interact with a broader group of our executives and employees and gain firsthand insights into our operations.
Directors may also attend outside director and other continuing education programs to assist them in staying current on developments in corporate governance, our industry, the global environment and issues critical to the operation of public company boards.

Board Membership and External Relationships 
[END TABLE]
Directors are required to ensure that their other commitments, including for example, other board memberships, employment, partnerships and consulting arrangements, do not interfere with their duties and responsibilities as members of the Board. Directors provide notice to the General Counsel prior to accepting an invitation to serve on the board of any other organization, and the General Counsel advises the Chairperson of the Governance Committee (or the Chairperson of the Board, if notice is from the Chairperson of the Governance Committee). A director should not accept service on such other board unless advised by the Chairperson of the Governance Committee (or Chairperson of the Board, as appropriate) that such engagement will not unacceptably create conflicts of interest or regulatory issues, conflict with Company policies or otherwise interfere with the director's duties and responsibilities as a member of the Board. Directors are also required promptly to inform the General Counsel if an actual or potential conflict of interest arises, or they are concerned that a conflict may arise or circumstances could otherwise interfere with their duties and responsibilities as a director. Directors are required to seek to avoid even an appearance of an improper conflict of interest.
Directors may not serve on more than three other boards of publicly traded companies in addition to our Board without the written approval of the Chairperson of the Governance Committee (or Chairperson of the Board, as appropriate). A director who is a full-time employee of our Company may not serve on the board of more than two other public companies unless approved by the Board. When a director's principal occupation or business association changes substantially during his or her tenure as a director, the Board expects the director to tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Governance Committee, which subsequently will recommend to the Board what action to take. 
We have a retirement policy whereby a director will retire at the annual meeting following his or her 75th birthday, unless the Board determines, based on special circumstances, that it is in the Company's best interest to request that the director serve beyond such date.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Effect of Failure to Receive the Required Vote or Obtain and Retain Security Clearance 
[END TABLE]
Each director is required to tender a resignation that will be effective upon (i) the failure to receive the required vote at any future meeting at which such director faces re-election, the failure to obtain top secret security clearance within 12 months of election or appointment to the Board or the failure to retain a top secret security clearance once obtained and (ii) the Board's acceptance of such resignation. If an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election or fails to obtain and retain a top secret security clearance, the Governance Committee will consider whether the Board should accept the director's resignation and will submit a recommendation for prompt consideration by the Board. The Board will decide whether to accept or reject a resignation within 90 days, unless the Board determines that compelling circumstances require additional time. The Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factor they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a resignation, including, without limitation, any harm to our Company that may result from accepting the resignation, and the underlying reasons for the action at issue.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board and Committee Self-Evaluation 
[END TABLE]
The Board and each Committee conduct annually thorough self-assessment processes. These processes are intended to ensure and enhance the effective operation of the Board. 
The self-assessment of the Board is overseen by the Governance Committee. As part of this assessment, the Lead Independent Director and Chairperson of the Governance Committee facilitate a broad discussion of Board performance, held in executive session. Among other topics, the Board considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the Board's effectiveness in evaluating and monitoring the Company's business plan, long-term strategy and risks; 
โข whether strategic and critical issues are being addressed by the Board in a timely manner; 
โข whether the Board's expectations and concerns are openly communicated to and discussed with the Chief Executive Officer; 
โข whether there is adequate contact between the Board and members of senior management; 
โข whether the directors collectively operate effectively as a Board; 
โข whether the individual directors have the appropriate mix of attributes and skills to fulfill their duties as directors of the Company;

โข whether the Board has focused adequately on succession planning; and 
โข whether the Board is adequately responsive to shareholder communication. 
[END TABLE]
Following this review, the Board discusses the results and identifies opportunities for improvement, including any necessary steps to implement such improvements. 
Also as part of the annual self-assessment process, each non-employee director completes an individual director evaluation for each of the other non-employee directors. These assessments include, among other topics, each non-employee director's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข understanding of the Company's overall business and risk profile and its significant financial opportunities and plans;  
โข engagement during meetings and other Board functions;  
โข analysis of benefits and risks of courses of action considered by the Board; and  
โข appropriate respect for the views of other Board members. 
[END TABLE]
The Lead Independent Director or the Chairperson of the Governance Committee meets with each non-employee director individually to discuss the results of his or her assessment, including comments provided by other non-employee directors. The Lead Independent Director or the Chairperson of the Governance Committee reports generally on the overall results of these discussions to the Board in executive session. These evaluations also assist the Governance Committee with its recommendation for directors to be renominated for election to the Board of Directors.
Each of the Committees also conducts an annual self-assessment. During an executive session led by the Committee chairperson, the Committee discusses, among other topics: whether the quality of participation and discussion at the Committee meetings is effective in facilitating the Committee's obligations under its charter; the opportunity to engage in strategic discussion; and whether the Committee is covering the right topics in the right amount of detail. Following this discussion, the Committee develops and implements a list of action items, as appropriate.

Succession Planning 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that providing for strong and effective continuity of leadership is critical to the success of our Company. The Board commits significant resources to succession planning, with processes in place for the Board:

โข to work with the Chief Executive Officer to support and ensure the development of potential succession candidates for the Chief Executive Officer and other leadership positions;

Corporate Responsibility 
[END TABLE]
Corporate responsibility and sustainability are critical to our business and long-term value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. Our strong culture โ founded in ethics, integrity, diversity and inclusion, and focused on sustainable performance, profitable growth, accountability, effective governance and responsible citizenship โ enables our success. Strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs and practices help us attract and maintain the best talent, perform for our customers and create value for our shareholders.
The Policy Committee of our Board provides leadership and oversight of our ESG practices. The Committee provides oversight of our policies and programs related to both corporate responsibility and sustainability, and regularly reviews our community relations activities, among other responsibilities. We engage with a variety of stakeholders and regularly obtain feedback on our ESG performance. 
In 2018, we published our tenth annual corporate responsibility report (CRR). Using the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, we continued to report to our stakeholders on our progress in meeting various environmental, social and governance performance indicators. You may view a copy of our annual CRR at crreport.northropgrumman.com. For the eighth consecutive year, we incorporated non-financial sustainability performance metrics into our annual incentive compensation program. See page 45 in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section.
We are proud that our corporate responsibility and sustainability programs received various notable recognitions in 2018. They include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข a leadership score of A- in CDP's 2018 climate change program for the seventh consecutive year;  
โข the Catalyst award for our "Build the Best Culture, Leverage the Power of Women" campaign which drove significant increases in the percentage of women in our executive ranks; 
โข an A rating from MSCI for environmental, social and governance management and performance;  
โข Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the third consecutive year; and 
โข one of DiversityInc's Top 50 Companies for Diversity for the ninth year in a row. 
[END TABLE]
Aligned with, and an integral part of, our commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct, is our respect for human rights. This respect is embedded in our culture, and reflected in the Company's Human Rights Policy, which was adopted in 2013 and is available on the Company's website at www.northropgrumman.com/CorporateResponsibility/Pages/HumanRightsPolicy.aspx.  
The Human Rights Policy provides, among other things, that the Company treats employees, suppliers, customers and competitors with dignity and respect. The Company does not tolerate any discrimination in employment based on an individual's protected status. We do not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, bonded labor, human trafficking or other violations of human rights.  The Human Rights Policy provides employees with a well-defined reporting channel when they believe there may have been a violation of the Policy. 
Our policy is further implemented through various of our human resources, contracting, and compliance programs. It is reinforced through communications and robust training at all levels of our Company. Both the Company's policy and commitment are also implemented and enforced through our Standards of Business Conduct and our Supplier Standards of Business Conduct, which clearly articulates our requirement for ethical conduct and social responsibility at all tiers of our supply base.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, is responsible for reviewing and recommending for approval the compensation of the non-employee directors. At the request of the Compensation Committee, the independent compensation consultant prepares annually a comprehensive benchmarking of our non-employee director compensation program against the compensation programs offered by our Target Industry Peer Group (the same peer group against which executive compensation is compared). Consistent with this benchmarking, the overarching approach for non-employee director compensation is to target approximately the 50th percentile of the Target Industry Peer Group and to align our director compensation with our shareholders' interests.
In May 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the current non-employee director fee structure, effective May 16, 2018.

The Director Program was amended and restated effective January 1, 2016 (the Amended Director Program). Directors received an annual equity grant of Automatic Stock Units on May 17, 2017, which vested on May 17, 2018, and received an annual equity grant of Automatic Stock Units on May 16, 2018 which will vest on May 16, 2019. Under the Amended Director Program, directors may elect to have all or any portion of their Automatic Stock Units paid on (A) the earlier of (i) the beginning of a specified calendar year after the vesting date or (ii) their separation from service as a member of the Board, or (B) the vesting date. Directors may elect to defer to a later year all or a portion of their remaining cash retainer or committee retainer fees into a stock unit account as Elective Stock Units or in alternative investment options. Elective Stock Units are awarded on a calendar quarterly basis. Directors may elect to have all or a portion of their Elective Stock Units paid on the earlier of (i) the beginning of a specified calendar year or (ii) their separation from service as a member of the Board. Stock units awarded under the Amended Director Program will be paid out in an equivalent number of shares of our common stock. Deferral elections are made prior to the beginning of the year for which the retainer fees will be paid. Directors are credited with dividend equivalents in connection with the accumulated stock units until the shares of common stock related to such stock units are issued. 
Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in our Matching Gifts Program for Education. Under this program, the Northrop Grumman Foundation matches director contributions, up to $10,000 per year per director, to eligible educational programs in accordance with the program.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Stock Ownership Requirements and Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy 
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors are required to own common stock of the Company in an amount equal to five times the annual cash retainer, with such ownership to be achieved within five years of the director's election to the Board. Deferred stock units and Company stock owned outright by the director count towards this requirement. 
Company policy prohibits members of the Board of Directors from pledging or engaging in hedging transactions with respect to any of their Company stock, continuing to align the interests of our Board of Directors with those of our shareholders. None of the shares of Company common stock held by our directors are pledged or subject to any hedging transaction.

Related Person Transactions  
[END TABLE]
The Company has a written policy approved by the Board, for the review, approval and ratification of transactions between our Company and our directors, executive officers and other related persons (Related Person Transactions Policy). A copy of the policy is available on the Investor Relations section of our website (www.northropgrumman.com). The policy provides for related person transactions to be reviewed in advance and approved or ratified, as applicable, by the Board of Directors, the Governance Committee or the Chairperson of the Governance Committee. A related person transaction may be approved if, after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances, the reviewing party concludes that approving the related person transaction is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The policy defines a related person transaction as any transaction in which the Company was, is or will be a participant, where the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which a related person had, has or is expected to have a direct or indirect material interest. A "related person" includes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข any of our directors or executive officers; 
โข any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock; 
โข an immediate family member of any such persons; or 
โข any firm, corporation, or other entity controlled by any such persons. 
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Secretary may determine that, based on facts and circumstances, a transaction in an amount less than $120,000 should nonetheless be deemed a related person transaction. If this occurs, the transaction would be submitted for review and approval or ratification in accordance with the policy. Under exceptional circumstances, if a related person transaction has not been approved in advance, the Governance Committee will recommend to the Board of Directors such action as the Governance Committee deems appropriate, including ratification, amendment or termination of the transaction.
The policy requires each director and executive officer to complete an annual questionnaire to identify his or her related interests and to notify the Corporate Secretary of any changes in their information. 
During 2018, the Company employed one family member of an executive officer who received compensation in excess of the reporting threshold. The spouse of our Corporate Vice President and President, Enterprise Services, Shawn Purvis, was employed by the Company as a Consulting Computer Systems Architect in our Technology Services sector. He received cash compensation (base salary and bonus) of approximately $230,000 and participated in the Company's benefit plans, commensurate with his position at the Company.
State Street Corporation (State Street), acting in various fiduciary capacities, filed a Schedule 13G/A with the SEC reporting that as of December 31, 2018, State Street and certain of its subsidiaries collectively were the beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. A subsidiary of State Street is the trustee for various Northrop Grumman defined benefit and defined contribution plan trusts. Two other State Street subsidiaries provide investment management services. During 2018, those State Street subsidiaries received approximately $9.5 million for such services, with over 99% of that amount paid by the plan trusts.
BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) filed a Schedule 13G/A with the SEC reporting that as of December 31, 2018, BlackRock and certain of its subsidiaries collectively were the beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. A subsidiary of BlackRock provides investment management services for the Northrop Grumman Rabbi Trust II and certain assets within various Northrop Grumman defined benefit and defined contribution plan trusts. During 2018, the trusts paid that BlackRock subsidiary approximately $3.2 million for such services.
At the request of our Chief Executive Officer and as authorized by the Board of Directors, Wesley G. Bush has agreed to provide limited consulting service to the Company after his retirement as our Chairman in July 2019, for an initial period of five years. Consulting fees are not expected to exceed $200,000 per year.

During 2018, no member of the Compensation Committee had a relationship with the Company or any of our subsidiaries, other than as directors and shareholders, and no member was an officer or employee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries, a participant in a related person transaction or an executive officer of another entity, where one of our executive officers serves on the board of directors that would constitute a related person transaction or raise concerns of a Compensation Committee interlock.

PROPOSAL TWO: ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
[END TABLE]
Consistent with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs. This advisory vote, commonly known as "say-on-pay," gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their view on our 2018 executive compensation programs and policies for our NEOs. The vote does not address any specific item of compensation and is not binding on the Board; however, as an expression of our shareholders' views, the Compensation Committee seriously considers the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. The Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual advisory votes on the compensation of our NEOs.
We believe our compensation programs reflect responsible, measured practices that effectively incentivize our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. Our pay practices are aligned with our shareholders' interests and with leading industry practice and are governed by a set of strong policies. Examples include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Double-trigger provisions for change in control situations, and no excise tax gross-ups for payments upon termination after a change in control; 
โข A recoupment policy applicable to cash and equity incentive compensation payments; 
โข Stock ownership guidelines of 7x base salary for the CEO and 3x base salary for other NEOs, and stock holding requirements of three years from the vesting date for equity awards; and  
โข Prohibitions on hedging or pledging of Company stock. 
[END TABLE]
For a more extensive list of our best practices, refer to page 37 of this Proxy Statement. In addition, our Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) provides a detailed discussion of our performance-based approach to executive compensation. We encourage you to read the CD&A, the rest of this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Form 10-K, which describes our business and 2018 results in more detail.
Recommendation
The compensation of our executives is aligned to performance, is sensitive to shareholder returns, appropriately motivates and retains our executives, and is a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining the high caliber talent necessary to drive our business forward and build sustainable value for our shareholders. Accordingly, the Board recommends that shareholders approve the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that, as an advisory matter, the shareholders of Northrop Grumman Corporation approve the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion."
Vote Required
Approval of this proposal requires that the votes cast "for" the proposal exceed the votes cast "against" the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL TWO.

To reflect the strength of leadership already demonstrated by Ms. Warden and the Board's confidence in the succession transition and future performance, the Board of Directors approved for Ms. Warden a one-time promotion long-term incentive grant of $5,000,000. The grant is comprised of 70% Restricted Performance Stock Rights (RPSRs) for the 2018-2020 performance period and 30% Restricted Stock Rights (RSRs).
Wesley Bush will continue to serve as Chairman until his retirement on July 31, 2019. Mr. Bush has presided as CEO since January 2010, through numerous business restructuring and business divestitures which have grown shareholder value and strategically positioned the Company for future growth and success. The Board of Directors approved continued vesting of the two long-term incentive grants, previously awarded to Mr. Bush in 2017 and 2018, and as a result, these grants will continue to vest through the applicable performance and vesting periods. These grants will have the same holding requirements as described on page 50 and the modifications extend post-employment covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees, to July 31, 2022.
At the request of Ms. Warden and as authorized by the Board of Directors, Mr. Bush has agreed to provide limited consulting service to the Company after July 2019, for an initial period of five years. Consulting fees are not expected to exceed $200,000 per year.
All references to CEO compensation in this CD&A reflect Mr. Bush's compensation in connection with his service as CEO during all of 2018.

New Sector Leadership 
[END TABLE]
On June 6, 2018, Northrop Grumman completed a strategic acquisition of Orbital ATK to expand capabilities and accelerate innovation in critical global security domains. The legacy Orbital ATK business became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and its name was changed to Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, Inc., which we established as a new, fourth business sector (Innovation Systems). We elected Blake Larson, previously the Chief Operating Officer of Orbital ATK, as the President of the new operating sector.
Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated September 17, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), the majority of the value of Mr. Larson's 2018 legacy Orbital ATK long-term grants was forfeited. In recognition of Mr. Larson's proven leadership and his election as an officer of the Company, the Board approved a new, long-term incentive grant of $3,000,000 for the 2018-2020 performance period, comprised of 70% RPSRs and 30% RSRs.
Former executives of the legacy Orbital ATK company participated in change-in-control plans, the Income Security Plans (ISPs). Upon joining Northrop Grumman, Mr. Larson agreed to waive any rights to further compensation and benefits under the ISPs and the Merger Agreement retention grant. In recognition of this forfeited value, the Company provided Mr. Larson a one-time RSR award of $3,500,000. The terms of this award are reported in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 55.

We provide an attractive, flexible and market-based total compensation program tied to performance and aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Our objective is to recruit and retain the caliber of executives and other key employees capable of achieving top performance and generating value for our shareholders, customers and employees.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Pay for Performance 
โข Our incentive plans are based on peer and market benchmarked performance metrics. 
Leadership Retention and Succession 
โข Compensation is designed to be competitive within our industry and retain top talent. 
โข Programs are designed to motivate and reward NEOs for delivering operational and strategic performance over time. 
Sustainable Performance 
โข Our AIP includes both financial and non-financial metrics to ensure we are building a strong foundation for long-term sustainable performance and shareholder value creation. 
Alignment with Shareholder Interests 
โข Our compensation structure places an appropriate amount of compensation at risk based on annual and long-term results. 
โข At-risk compensation is based on financial and non-financial performance measures and relative TSR. 
โข A significant portion of compensation is delivered in equity, the vesting and value of which provides alignment with shareholder returns. 
โข Stock ownership guidelines, holding requirements for equity awards and our recoupment policy further align executive and shareholder interests. 
Benchmarking 
โข Compensation program provisions and financial objectives are evaluated on an annual basis and modified in accordance with industry and business conditions. 
โข We seek to outperform our peers (a group of top global defense companies identified as the Performance Peer Group on page 42). 
โข We use a Target Industry Peer Group (identified on page 43) for broader market executive compensation analyses that includes companies based on a peer-of-peers analysis. 
Compensation Risk Management 
โข The Compensation Committee, together with its independent compensation consultant, conducts an annual assessment of the compensation programs to determine if there are potential material risks to the Company. 
โข Both the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant evaluate the mix of at-risk compensation linked to stock appreciation. 
โข The assessment is to confirm there is an appropriate balance in the executive compensation programs, practices and policies.

How We Make Compensation Decisions 
[END TABLE]
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing our compensation policies, incentive and equity compensation plans and approving payments or grants under these plans for elected officers (other than the CEO). The Compensation Committee recommends the compensation for our CEO to the independent directors of the Board for approval and approves the compensation for the other NEOs. In performing its duties, the Compensation Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข receives advice from an independent compensation consultant who reports directly to the Compensation Committee and is discussed further below; 
โข reviews market data and other input from its independent compensation consultant; 
โข reviews and approves incentive goals and objectives (CEO goals and objectives are reviewed and approved by the independent directors); 
โข evaluates and approves executive benefit and perquisite programs; and 
โข evaluates the competitiveness of each elected officer's total compensation package. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee annually reviews and discusses with management the CD&A and provides a Compensation Committee Report for inclusion in the proxy statement.
For more information regarding the composition of the Compensation Committee and its duties and responsibilities, see "Corporate Governance โ Committees of the Board of Directors โ Compensation Committee." 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co. (the Compensation Consultant). The Compensation Consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee may replace the Compensation Consultant or hire additional consultants at any time. A representative of the Compensation Consultant regularly participates in meetings of the Compensation Committee and communicates with the Compensation Committee Chairperson between meetings as needed; however, the Compensation Committee and the independent directors of the Board make final decisions on the compensation actions for the NEOs. The Compensation Consultant also participates in executive session with the Compensation Committee. Other than the fees paid to the Compensation Consultant pursuant to its engagement by the Compensation Committee for its advice on executive and director compensation, the Compensation Consultant does not receive any fees or income from the Company.
The Compensation Consultant provides an independent review of market data and advises the Compensation Committee on the levels and structure of our executive compensation policies and procedures, including compensation matters for NEOs. The Compensation Consultant utilizes aerospace and defense industry market data and conducts an independent review of publicly available data.
The roles of the Compensation Consultant include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข reviewing and advising the Compensation Committee on our total compensation philosophy, peer groups and target competitive positioning; 
โข identifying market trends and practices and advising the Compensation Committee on program design implications; 
โข providing proactive advice to the Compensation Committee on best practices for Board governance of executive compensation, compensation-related risk management, and any areas for program design to most appropriately support the Company's business strategy and organizational values; and 
โข serving as a resource to the Compensation Committee Chairperson on setting agenda items for Compensation Committee meetings and undertaking special projects. 
[END TABLE]
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that there were no relationships between the Compensation Consultant and the Company or any of the Company's directors or executive officers that raised a conflict of interest. 
Role of Management
Our CEO makes compensation-related recommendations for elected officers to the Compensation Committee for its review and approval. The CEO's evaluation is based on each officer's compensation relative to market and the overall framework, philosophy and objectives for our executive compensation programs set by the Compensation Committee.

The recommendations for elected officers are based on an assessment of each executive's performance, skills and industry knowledge, market compensation benchmarks, and succession and retention considerations. The Chief Human Resources Officer provides a summary of historical compensation and benefits-related data when compensation decisions are considered by the Compensation Committee to ensure compensation decisions are made within our total compensation framework.
Management also provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding executive incentive and benefit plan designs and strategies. These recommendations include financial and non-financial operational goals and criteria for our annual and long-term incentive plans.

Performance Peer Group: Set Performance Targets and Evaluate Performance
The Compensation Committee uses the Performance Peer Group for purposes of setting performance targets and evaluating performance for our AIP and LTIP. The Performance Peer Group is comprised of the largest global defense companies by government revenues within the aerospace and defense market space. AIP goals for 2018 and goals for the LTIP grants made during 2018 that will vest in 2020 were established based on the 2018 Performance Peer Group.

Target Industry Peer Group: Benchmark Executive Compensation Practices 
The Compensation Committee benchmarks our executive compensation levels and practices against a Target Industry Peer Group of 14 companies, as well as against a subset of the Target Industry Peer Group containing six direct peers. Prior to the beginning of the year, the Compensation Committee sets the Target Industry Peer Group and the subset of direct peers used to benchmark compensation for the following year. To identify peer companies for compensation benchmarking purposes, the Compensation Consultant employed an objective criteria-based methodology where:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the company was identified as a peer by at least two aerospace and defense peers or proxy advisory services; 
โข the company participated in the annual Aon Hewitt executive compensation study; and 
โข revenues, total employees and market capitalization of the company were broadly similar to those of the Company.

While the Target Industry Peer Group is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee with the Compensation Consultant, our goal is to keep it as consistent as reasonably possible on a year-over-year basis. The companies that comprise the 2018 Target Industry Peer Group are listed in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]

3M Company Johnson Controls International 
The Boeing Company (1) L3 Technologies, Inc. (1)

Emerson Electric Company Rockwell Collins, Inc. 
General Dynamics Corporation (1) Textron, Inc. 
Honeywell International, Inc. (1) United Technologies Corporation 
(1) Included in the subset of six direct peers also used for compensation benchmarking 
[END TABLE]
It is the Company's pay philosophy to provide the CEO a compensation package that comprises competitive elements of base salary and target variable pay relative to the Target Industry Peer Group. In 2018, the CEO's target total direct compensation approximated the median of the Target Industry Peer Group. 
Another element of the Company's pay philosophy is to tie a significant portion of the CEO's pay to performance. As a result, the CEO's actual compensation may differ from this market median based on the Company's actual performance. 
In determining the base salary and target variable pay elements for the other NEOs, the Compensation Committee does not set any specific benchmark relative to the Target Industry Peer Group; rather, the Compensation Committee considers several factors in determining their compensation, including executive compensation levels and practices of the Target Industry Peer Group, NEO individual experience, growth in job as demonstrated through sustained performance, leadership impact, retention and pay relative to the CEO. Actual annual incentive awards and long-term incentive award opportunities reflect these factors, as well as Company performance.

Annual Incentive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Under our shareholder-approved 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan), the Compensation Committee approves the annual incentive compensation target payout percentage for each NEO other than the CEO. For the CEO, such percentage is approved by the independent directors of the Board.
The target incentive award (target bonus) represents a percentage of each NEO's base salary. Following the completion of the fiscal year, the target bonus is used by the Compensation Committee, together with its assessment of Company performance against pre-determined performance criteria, to determine the final bonus award amount.
2018 Annual Incentive
The 2018 target bonus for the CEO was 180% of base salary, which was unchanged from 2017. The 2018 target bonus for the COO was 120% of base salary and 100% of base salary for the CFO and other NEOs, including Mr. Larson, as the new Innovation Systems sector president. Mr. Larson's final bonus award reflects the time he served in his role as an elected officer of Orbital ATK and of Northrop Grumman.
Final bonus awards for each NEO were determined by multiplying the Northrop Grumman Company Performance Factor (CPF) by the target bonus. The CPF can range from 0% to 200%.
Annual Incentive Formula for 2018 (1):
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Base Salary  X   Target Payout%  =   Target Bonus  
  Base Salary  X   Target Payout%  =   Target Bonus  
  Base Salary  X   Target Payout%  =   Target Bonus  
  Target Bonus  X   CPF  =   Final Bonus Award  
  Target Bonus  X   CPF  =   Final Bonus Award  
[END TABLE]
Annual performance evaluations are conducted by the CEO for each NEO, other than the CEO, and reviewed with the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee considers this performance information as well as the comparison to market data.
The Compensation Committee approves bonus amounts for all NEOs except the CEO, whose annual bonus is recommended by the Compensation Committee to the independent members of the Board for approval. The Compensation Committee has discretion to make adjustments to the annual bonus payouts for NEOs, except the CEO, if it determines such adjustment is warranted. For example, in instances where Company performance has been impacted by unforeseen or unusual events, the Compensation Committee has exercised its authority to increase the final awards as necessary to preserve the intended incentives and benefits. The Compensation Committee has also adjusted payouts downward in the past, despite performance targets having been met, when it determined that particular circumstances had a negative impact on the Company but were not reflected in the performance calculation.

2018 Annual Incentive Goals and Results
For the AIP, we use a mix of financial and non-financial metrics to measure our performance. Our AIP metrics reflect our commitment to investing for and achieving long-term profitable growth; maintaining alignment with shareholders' interests; and incentivizing top performance against our industry peers. For 2018, the Compensation Committee again selected Pension-adjusted OM Rate* and Pension-adjusted Net Income* Growth and refined the cash performance metric to Pension-adjusted Cash Flow from Operations* from the previous metric of Pension-adjusted Cash Flow from Operations Conversion*. The financial metrics are each weighted at 1/3 and are defined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Pension-adjusted OM Rate*: establishes high program performance expectations for the Company and is calculated as OM rate (operating margin divided by sales) before net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment (the difference between pension expense charged to contracts and included as cost in segment operating income* in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and the service component of pension expense determined in accordance with GAAP (FAS)). 
โข Pension-adjusted Cash Flow from Operations*: recognizes the importance of converting net income into cash. The metric is calculated as cash provided by operating activities before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions*. Pension-adjusted Cash Flow from Operations* enables management to make capital investment decisions that support long-term profitable growth without impacting performance-based incentive compensation. 
โข Pension-adjusted Net Income* Growth: incentivizes management to achieve relative long-term profitable growth greater than a projected industry growth rate. Pension-adjusted Net Income* Growth is calculated as net income before the after-tax impact of the total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. 
[END TABLE]
In addition to these financial goals, we established non-financial goals to align our objectives with all our stakeholders. Performance against non-financial metrics can result only in a downward adjustment to the financial metric score. For 2018, we selected the following non-financial metrics:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Customer Satisfaction: measured in terms of customer feedback, including customer-generated performance scores, award fees and verbal and written feedback. 
โข Diversity: measured in terms of improving representation of females and people of color in all management level positions with respect to internal and external benchmarks. 
โข Engagement & Inclusion: measured based on performance at or above the global high performing norm for engagement and inclusion indices and an accountability metric (as reported in a company-wide employee survey). 
โข Environmental Sustainability: measured in terms of reductions in absolute greenhouse gas emissions and potable water use consumption, and improvement in solid waste diversion (i.e., waste diverted from landfill disposal). 
โข Quality: measured using program-specific objectives, including defect rates, process quality, supplier quality, planning quality or other appropriate criteria for program type and phase. 
โข Safety: measured by total case rate, defined as the number of Occupational Safety & Health Administration recordable injuries as well as by lost work day rate associated with those injuries. 
[END TABLE]
Our AIP provides for payout levels from 0% to 200% of target. The minimum, target and maximum performance levels are derived based on an analysis of the past performance of our Performance Peer Group (Pension-adjusted Net Income* Growth is based on projected market growth rates). Specific values are identified for each metric at selected points in the range between minimum and maximum and other values are determined by linear interpolation between these points. No payout is made if performance is below the minimum. Above target payout can be earned only if the Company's performance exceeds the performance threshold noted in the table below. The maximum 200% payout is based upon top quartile past performance of the Performance Peer Group. This structure rewards superior performance by aligning above-target payouts to outperforming our peer benchmarks and provides reduced awards for below target performance.

In determining the Company Performance Factor, both financial and non-financial performance against goals is assessed. The Company financial performance for the three metrics shown in the table below was 166%. As approved by the Compensation Committee, Company performance calculations exclude the impacts of the addition of Innovation Systems, certain Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses and certain impacts related to the Company's 2018 adoption of the MTM method of accounting for its pension and OPB plans as detailed in "Appendix A - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".

Pension-adjusted OM Rate* 1/3 9.9% 11.4% 67% 
Pension-adjusted Cash Flow from Operations* 1/3 $3.4B $3.2B 32% 
Pension-adjusted Net Income* Growth 1/3 $1.9B $2.4B 67% 
        166% 
* This metric is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, see "Appendix A - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
[END TABLE]
Performance against the annual non-financial metrics cannot exceed 100% and can result only in a downward adjustment to the financial performance score. The Company demonstrated strong performance in 2018 overall against the non-financial goals, and the Compensation Committee approved a non-financial score of 96.5%. In consideration of both the financial and non-financial performance, the 2018 Company Performance Factor was determined to be 160%.
Consistent with Mr. Larson's continued leadership of the legacy Orbital ATK business in the newly established Innovation Systems sector, Mr. Larson's 2018 final bonus award was determined based on the pre-established annual incentive goals under the Executive Officer Incentive Plan, 75% based on financial metrics and 25% based on operational objectives. For Mr. Larson, the Compensation Committee approved a performance range of 0%-200%. For 2018, the Orbital ATK financial metrics and targets consisted of Earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) ($540M), Revenue ($4.8B), Free Cash Flow ($226M), equally weighted at 30% and Orders ($4.7B) weighted at 10%. The 2018 operational objectives were aimed at improving company processes and business systems, achieving certain cost reductions, and providing strong support to business group initiatives. The Compensation Committee assessed the 2018 performance and approved a score of 160%. In 2019, Mr. Larson will participate in the same AIP applicable to Northrop Grumman elected officers.
Decisions for 2018 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the independent members of our Board approved, a 2018 annual incentive award of $4,562,000 for Mr. Bush and a 2018 annual incentive award of $1,920,000 for Ms. Warden. As CEO, Ms. Warden recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, the other NEOs' annual incentive awards.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
2018 Long-Term Incentive Program
In determining the amount of the individual long-term incentive award for an NEO (other than the CEO), the Compensation Committee considers an elected officer's individual performance during the preceding year, growth in job as demonstrated through sustained performance, leadership impact, retention and pay relative to the CEO, as well as market data for the elected officer's position based on the Target Industry Peer Group analysis.
In 2018, after determining the award value for the NEOs as described above, the Compensation Committee granted awards in the form of RPSRs to ensure sustainability and achievement of business goals over time and RSRs to provide retention value. The awards were comprised of 70% RPSRs and 30% RSRs. The Compensation Committee determined this long-term incentive mix would appropriately motivate and reward the NEOs to achieve our long-term objectives and further reinforce the link between their interests and the interests of our shareholders.
The RPSRs will vest and be distributed following the completion of the three-year performance period (commencing January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020) if goals are met. The RSRs generally vest 100% after three years. Earned RPSRs and RSRs may be paid in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash at the Compensation Committee's discretion. An executive generally must remain employed through the vesting period to earn an award. Vesting for termination due to death, disability, retirement or change in control is discussed in the "Termination Payments and Benefits" section on page 66. Dividend equivalents accrue on both RPSR and RSR awards earned and will be paid upon distribution of the RPSRs and RSRs.
The Compensation Committee evaluates RPSR performance requirements each year to ensure they are aligned with our business objectives. For the 2018 RPSR grant, the Compensation Committee determined that for the NEOs, performance metrics will continue to be relative TSR and Cumulative FCF*, equally weighted at 50%. The current metrics and weightings reflect the Company's continued emphasis on operational performance directly impacted by management decisions and behaviors, while maintaining strong alignment with shareholder interests. Based on the performance against these metrics, shares earned for 2018 RPSR grants can vary from 0% to 150% of the rights awarded.
TSR is measured by comparing cumulative stock price appreciation with reinvestment of dividends over a three-year period to the Performance Peer Group (50% of relative TSR portion of award) and to the S&P Industrials (50% of relative TSR portion of award), which comprises companies within the S&P 500 classified as Industrials, reflecting the range of similar investment alternatives available to our shareholders. To smooth volatility in the market, the TSR calculation is based on the average of the 30 calendar days immediately prior to the start of the performance period and the last 30 calendar days of the performance period. The maximum relative TSR payout is capped at 100% of target shares if the absolute TSR is negative, even if the relative TSR would have resulted in a higher score.
Cumulative FCF* focuses on cash generation after capital investments and is calculated as the aggregate free cash flow before the after-tax impact of total pension funding* over a three-year period. Free cash flow* includes funds available to create shareholder value after investing in the business through capital expenditures.
Recently Completed RPSR Performance Period (2016 โ 2018)
In February 2016, when granting RPSRs to NEOs who were elected officers at the time of the grant, the Compensation Committee selected relative TSR weighted at 70% and Cumulative FCF* weighted at 30% as the performance metrics for the awards and established the performance criteria for the awards as set forth in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed performance for the January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 RPSR performance period. The combined weighted score for the metrics generated an overall performance score of 115% (excluding the impact of Innovation Systems as detailed in "Appendix A - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures").
In February 2019, the NEOs received payouts in stock with respect to the outstanding RPSR awards that were granted in February 2016 for the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018 (as described further in footnote 3 to the Outstanding Equity Awards Table on page 56).
[BEGIN TABLE]
Other Benefits 
[END TABLE]
This section describes other benefits the NEOs receive. These benefits are not performance related and are designed to provide a competitive package for purposes of attracting and retaining the executive talent needed to achieve our business objectives. These benefits include retirement benefits, certain perquisites and severance arrangements.
Retirement Benefits
We maintain tax-qualified retirement plans (both defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution savings plans) that cover most of our workforce, including the NEOs. We also maintain nonqualified retirement plans that are available to our NEOs, which are designed to restore benefits that were limited under the tax-qualified plans or to provide supplemental benefits. Compensation, age and years of service factor into the amount of benefits provided under the plans. Thus, the plans are structured to reward and retain employees of long service and recognize higher performance levels as evidenced by increases in annual pay. Additional information about these retirement plans and the NEO benefits under these plans can be found in the Pension Benefits Table and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table, on pages 58 and 63, respectively.
The Compensation Committee assesses aggregate benefits available to the NEOs and has previously imposed an overall cap, generally limited to no more than 60% of final average pay, on pension benefits for the NEOs (except for small variations due to contractual restrictions under the plans). The nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plans in which our NEOs participate were frozen as to pay and service as of December 31, 2014.
Retiree Medical Arrangement
The Special Officer Retiree Medical Plan (SORMP) was closed to new participants in 2007 and the life insurance benefit was removed in 2018. Participants in the SORMP are entitled to retiree medical benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Mr. Bush is eligible for SORMP benefits due to his date of hire and years of service as an executive. The other NEOs became elected officers after the SORMP was closed to new participants and are not eligible for SORMP benefits. The estimated cost of the SORMP benefit reflected in the Termination Payment Table is the present value of the estimated cost to provide future benefits using actuarial calculations and assumptions.
Perquisites
Our NEOs are eligible for certain limited executive perquisites that include financial planning, income tax preparation, physical exams and personal liability insurance. The Compensation Committee believes these perquisites are common within the competitive market for total compensation packages for executives and are useful in attracting, retaining and motivating talented executives. Perquisites provided to the NEOs in 2018 are detailed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 53.
Security Arrangements
Given the nature of our business, we maintain a comprehensive security program. As a component of that program, we provide residential and/or travel protection that we consider necessary to address our security requirements. In selecting the level and form of protection, we and the Board consider security risks faced by those in our industry in general and security risks specific to our Company and its individuals. Based on security threat information obtained and an ongoing dialogue with law enforcement officials, the Board has required that Mr. Bush and other NEOs receive varying levels of residential and travel protection.
Since we require this protection under a comprehensive security program and it is not designed to provide a personal benefit (other than the intended security), we do not view these security arrangements as compensation to the individuals. We report these security arrangements as perquisites as required under applicable SEC rules. In addition, we would report them as taxable compensation to the individuals if they were not excludable from income as working condition fringe benefits under Section 132 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Board has determined that the CEO should avoid traveling by commercial aircraft for purposes of security, rapid availability and communications connectivity during travel, and should use Company-provided aircraft for all air travel. If, as a result, the CEO uses Company-provided aircraft for personal travel, the costs of such travel are imputed as income and are subject to the appropriate tax reporting according to Internal Revenue Code regulations.

[END TABLE]
We regularly review the nature of the security threat and associated vulnerabilities with law enforcement and security specialists and will continue to revise our security program as appropriate.
In September 2018, the Board of Directors approved security protection for Ms. Warden as the incoming CEO, at the same level that such security protection is currently provided to the CEO, effective immediately.
Severance Benefits
We maintain the Severance Plan for Elected and Appointed Officers of Northrop Grumman Corporation (Severance Plan), which is available to our NEOs who qualify and are approved to receive such benefits. Mr. Bush is not eligible to participate in the Severance Plan. The purpose of the Severance Plan is to help bridge the gap in an executive's income and health coverage during a period of unemployment following termination, and to ensure certain benefits for the Company.
We do not maintain any change in control severance plans. In addition, we do not provide excise tax gross-ups for any payments received upon termination after a change in control.
Upon a "qualifying termination" (defined below) the Company will provide severance benefits to eligible NEOs under the Severance Plan. Provided the NEO signs a release and agrees to certain restrictions, he or she may receive: (i) a lump sum severance benefit equal to one and one-half times annual base salary and target bonus, (ii) a prorated performance bonus for the year of termination, (iii) continued medical and dental coverage for the eighteen-month severance period, (iv) income tax preparation/financial planning fees for the year of termination and the following year and (v) outplacement expenses up to 15% of salary, all subject to management approval. The cost of providing continued medical and dental coverage is based upon current premium costs. The cost of providing income tax preparation and financial planning is capped at $18,500 for the year of termination and $18,500 for the year following termination.
A "qualifying termination" includes one of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข involuntary termination, other than for cause or mandatory retirement; or 
โข election to terminate in lieu of accepting a downgrade to a non-officer position (i.e., good reason). 
[END TABLE]
Change in Control Benefits
We do not maintain separate change in control programs or agreements. The only change in control benefits available to the NEOs are those described in the terms and conditions of the grants under the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2011 Plan).
[BEGIN TABLE]
Policies and Procedures 
[END TABLE]
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We maintain stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs to further promote alignment of management and shareholder interests. These guidelines require that NEOs own Company stock with a value denominated as a multiple of their annual salaries, which can be accumulated over a five-year period from the date of hire or promotion into an elected officer position.
The guidelines are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position Stock Value as a Multiple of Base Salary 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 7x base salary 
Other NEOs 3x base salary 
[END TABLE]
Shares that satisfy the stock ownership guidelines include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Company stock owned outright; 
โข unvested RSRs; and 
โข the value of shares held in the Northrop Grumman Savings Plan or Northrop Grumman Financial Security and Savings Program. 
[END TABLE]
Unvested RPSRs are not included in calculating ownership until they are converted to actual shares owned.
The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with our stock ownership guidelines on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2018, all NEOs were in compliance with the ownership guidelines. The Compensation Committee continues to monitor compliance and will conduct a full review again in 2019.

[END TABLE]
Stock Holding Requirements 
We have a holding period requirement for payouts from long-term incentive grants, further emphasizing the importance of sustainable performance and appropriate risk-management behaviors. Under this policy, NEOs are required to hold, for a period of three years, 50% of their net after-tax shares received from RPSR distributions and RSR vestings. These restrictions generally continue following termination and retirement; however, shares acquired from RPSR distributions following termination or retirement occurring more than one year after separation from the Company are not subject to the holding requirement.
Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy
Company policy prohibits our NEOs and other elected officers from hedging, entering into margin transactions involving Company stock, and pledging Company securities as collateral for loans or other transactions.
Recoupment Policy
The Company's recoupment policy provides that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the Board has discretion to recoup incentive compensation paid to an elected officer in the event of a restatement or if an elected officer engages in illegal conduct that causes significant financial or reputational harm to the Company; 
โข the Board has discretion to recoup incentive compensation paid to the elected officer in the event the elected officer fails to report such misconduct of another, or is grossly negligent in fulfilling his or her supervisory responsibilities to prevent such misconduct; and 
โข the CEO has discretion to recoup under similar circumstances incentive compensation provided to non-elected officers or other employees. 
[END TABLE]
The Company's recoupment policy applies to a three-year look back of performance-based short- or long-term, cash or equity incentive payments. It provides for certain disclosure in the event of recoupment, consistent with SEC and other legal requirements.
Risk Management
The Compensation Committee annually reviews our compensation program and together with the independent compensation consultant assesses potential compensation-related risks to the Company. Based on this assessment for 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the risk profile is appropriate and substantial risk management features are incorporated into our compensation program. This determination reflects the following conclusions from the detailed risk assessment:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข there is appropriate balance to mitigate compensation-related risk in the executive compensation program's design between fixed and variable pay, cash and stock components, short- and long-term measures, financial and non-financial measures, and formulaic and discretionary decisions; 
โข there are appropriate policies in place to mitigate compensation-related risk, including the Compensation Committee's and its advisor's independence, transparent disclosure, officer stock ownership guidelines and holding period requirements, and hedging and recoupment policies; and 
โข there are no incentive or commission arrangements below the executive level that potentially encourage excessive risk-taking behavior. 
[END TABLE]
Grant Date for Equity Awards
Annual grant cycles for equity awards occur in February at the same time salary increases and annual incentive targets are determined. This timing allows the Compensation Committee to make decisions on each of these compensation components at the same time, utilizing a total compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves annual long-term incentive grants during its scheduled meeting, which occurs following announcement of our year-end financial results. Equity grants may also be granted on an interim basis throughout the year for special situations, such as new executive hires, promotions or retention.
Tax Deductibility of Pay
Under prior law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limited the annual tax deduction to $1 million per person for compensation paid to the Company's CEO and the next three highest-paid NEOs, other than the Chief Financial Officer (collectively, covered employees). Certain compensation, including qualified performance-based compensation, was not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements were met.
The 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, modified Section 162(m). The 2017 Tax Act expanded the definition of covered employees to include the Company's Chief Financial Officer and any employee who was a covered employee for any taxable year

beginning after December 31, 2016. The 2017 Tax Act also repealed the performance-based compensation exception to the deduction limit. These amendments, effective January 1, 2018, do not apply to compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, that was not materially modified after such date.
Say-on-Pay
Our shareholders are asked annually to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our NEOs. We regularly engage with our shareholders to understand their concerns regarding executive compensation. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and discusses the results of the say-on-pay vote. In 2018, our executive compensation programs continued to receive strong support from shareholders with 97% approval at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Based on its review and feedback from shareholder engagement, the Compensation Committee determined that our programs are effective and aligned with shareholder interests, and no substantive changes were required.

The 2018 value shown for Mr. Bush includes the value of his annual grant issued in February 2018 of $10,000,294 and the incremental amount that must be recognized in accordance with accounting standards for the modification to the 2017 and 2018 long-term incentive grants. The modification recognized Mr. Bush's significant business contributions and continuing role with the Company as Chairman as well as the extension of the post-employment covenants. The fair value of awards was computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are disclosed in Note 14 of the Company's 2018 Form 10-K. The maximum grant date fair values of the 2018 RPSRs are as follows, noting the grants assume a 150% maximum payout:

(4) These amounts relate solely to the increased present value of the NEO's pension plan benefits using mandatory SEC assumptions (see the descriptions of these plans under the Pension Benefits table on page 58). The amount accrued in each year differs from the amount accrued in prior years due to an increase in age, service and pay (salary and bonus).The change in pension value is also highly sensitive to changes in the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments to be made over the life of the executive.

In 2018, the aggregate change in actuarial present value of pension benefits is a negative amount for Mr. Bush (-$2,645,152), Ms. Warden (-$25,448) and Mr. Caylor (-$32,265) due primarily to increased interest rates. In accordance with SEC rules, the negative amounts are reported as $0 in the above table.
Mr. Bedingfield was hired after the Company's defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants, and as a result he does not participate in any defined benefit pension plans. 
Mr. Larson is a participant in the Orbital ATK Pension and Retirement Plan and Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. In 2018, the aggregate change in actuarial present value of his pension benefit is due to an increase in interest rates, benefits and age. 
There were no above-market earnings in the nonqualified deferred compensation plans (see the descriptions of these plans under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table on page 63).
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5) Amounts include, as applicable, (a) the value of perquisites and personal benefits, (b) basic life insurance premiums, (c) matching contributions through the Northrop Grumman Foundation made to eligible educational institutions and to non-profit organizations under a Company program, and (d) Company contributions to defined contribution and deferred compensation plans. Where the value of the items reported in a particular category for an NEO exceeded $10,000 in 2018 (other than perquisites and personal benefits, which are subject to different thresholds as described below), those items are identified and quantified below. 
[END TABLE]
Perquisites and Personal Benefits - Perquisites and other personal benefits provided to certain NEOs are as follows: security, travel-related perquisites (including use of Company aircraft or ground transportation services for personal travel and incidental expenses for family members if accompanying the NEO while on business travel), financial planning/income tax preparation services, insurance premiums paid by the Company on the NEO's behalf, executive physicals and other nominal perquisites or personal benefits. We determine the incremental cost for perquisites and personal benefits based on costs or charges incurred by the Company for the benefits. 
As discussed in "Key Components of Our Programs - Security Arrangements," the Company provides NEOs with certain residential and travel security protection due to the nature of our business and security threat information. The amounts reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column include expenses for certain residential and travel security that we treat as perquisites under relevant SEC guidance, even though the need for such expenses arises from the risks attendant with their positions with the Company. The Company calculates the cost of travel security coverage based on the hourly rates and overhead fees charged directly to the Company by the firms providing security personnel. If Company security personnel are used, their hourly rates are used to calculate the cost of coverage. The Company calculates the value of personal use of Company aircraft based on the incremental cost of each element. Fixed costs that would be incurred in any event to operate Company aircraft (e.g., aircraft purchase costs, maintenance not related to personal trips and flight crew salaries) are not included.
The cost of any category of the listed perquisites and personal benefits did not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of total perquisites and personal benefits for any NEO in 2018, except for the following: (i) costs attributable to security protection for Mr. Bush ($654,674), which includes personal travel on Company aircraft consistent with the Company's security program ($418,746); (ii) costs attributable to security protection for Ms. Warden ($252,625), which includes personal travel on Company aircraft consistent with the Company's security program ($68,963); and (iii) costs attributable to security protection for Mr. Bedingfield ($49,603). The amount of the Company's security costs for Mr. Bush has been reduced by $82,578, which reflects the portion of the security perquisite that Mr. Bush voluntarily reimbursed to the Company for himself and his family related to personal travel on the corporate aircraft ($76,619) and other security related costs ($5,959).
Contributions to Plans - In 2018, we made the following Company contributions to the defined contribution and deferred compensation plans:

2018 Pension Benefits 
[END TABLE]
The following table provides information about the pension plans in which the NEOs participate (described in more detail on the following pages), including the present value of each NEO's accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2018, calculated pursuant to SEC specifications for this table. Our policy generally limits an executive's total benefit under these plans to be no more than 60% of final average pay. Mr. Bush has voluntarily elected to limit his OSERP benefit to no more than 50% of final average pay.

(1) Mr. Bedingfield was hired after the Company's defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants, and as a result he does not participate in any defined benefit pension plans. 
(2) Credited service under OSERP for Mr. Bush and Mr. Caylor is less than actual service because credited service under this plan stopped as of December 31, 2014. In addition, Mr. Bush's credited service under his other plans is less because of his transfers among those plans due to Company acquisitions. Each NEO's actual service is as follows: Mr. Bush: 31.67; Ms. Warden: 10.33; Mr. Caylor: 16.5; Mr. Larson: 37.5. 
(3) Amounts are calculated using the following assumptions: 
โข The NEO retires on the earliest date he/she could receive an unreduced benefit under each plan; 
โข The form of payment is a single life annuity except for Mr. Larson whose OATK DB SERP benefit is paid as a lump sum; and 
โข The discount rate is 4.30% for the Pension Plan, 4.33% for the S&MS Pension Plan and 4.31% for all other plans. The mortality tables are the RP-2014 annuitant mortality tables adjusted for actual experience and projected generationally with an adjusted version of Scale MP-2018 for the OATK P&R Plan and RP-2006 annuitant mortality tables projected generationally with an adjusted version of Scale MP-2018 for all other plans except the OATK DB SERP which uses no mortality. These are the same assumptions used for the valuation of benefits in the Company's financial statements.

Pension Plans and Descriptions 
[END TABLE]
Most of the pension plans were closed to new hires in 2008. Prior to that time, the Company consolidated the pension plan provisions from diverse Heritage Formulas to a Cash Balance Formula. Over time, the Company also transitioned officers, including NEOs, from SERPs to a deferred compensation plan, called the Officers Retirement Account Contribution Plan. In addition, all final average pay formulas were frozen as of December 31, 2014.
Due to the acquisition of Orbital ATK and the inclusion of Mr. Larson as an NEO, this summary includes information relating to the Orbital ATK plans in which Mr. Larson participates. These plans were closed to new hires in 2006. They also transitioned to a Cash Balance Formula and the portion of Mr. Larson's benefit that is based on a final average pay formula was frozen on June 30, 2013.
The pension plans in which NEOs participate are listed below in alphabetical order.
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข ERISA 2 is the ERISA Supplemental Program 2. This plan makes participants whole for benefits they lose under the Pension Plan due to certain Internal Revenue Code limits. 
โข OATK DB SERP is the Orbital ATK Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. This plan provides a supplement pension benefit for certain heritage Orbital ATK executives. In addition, the plan makes participants whole for benefits they lose under the Orbital ATK P&R Plan due to certain Internal Revenue Code limits. 
โข OATK P&R Plan is the Orbital ATK Pension and Retirement Plan. This is a tax qualified pension plan covering a broad base of heritage Orbital ATK employees. 
โข OSERP is the Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program. This plan provides a supplemental pension benefit for certain Company officers. 
โข OSERP II is the Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program II. This plan provides a pension benefit for certain Company officers. 
โข Pension Plan is the Northrop Grumman Pension Plan. This is a tax qualified pension plan covering a broad base of Company employees. 
โข S&MS Pension Plan is the Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Salaried Pension Plan (former TRW plan). This is a tax qualified pension plan covering a broad base of Company employees. 
โข SRIP is the Northrop Grumman Supplementary Retirement Income Plan (former TRW plan). This plan makes participants whole for benefits they lose under the S&MS Pension Plan due to certain Internal Revenue Code limits. 
Pension Plan, S&MS Pension Plan and OATK P&R Plan (Tax Qualified Plans) 
[END TABLE]
Due to acquisitions, the Company acquired various pension plans with different types of pension formulas (Heritage Formulas). These are described in detail in the Heritage Formulas table that follows. Prior to 2005, the Company transitioned the various Heritage Formulas in these plans to a Cash Balance Formula. The Cash Balance Formula is a percentage of pay credited to a hypothetical account, which grows with interest. At retirement, the Cash Balance Account is converted to a monthly pension benefit (further information is included in the Cash Balance Formula section below). Except as provided below, the final benefit from each plan is the sum of the two formulas: the Heritage Formula benefit plus the Cash Balance Formula benefit.
The OATK P&R Plan also transitioned to a Cash Balance Formula, details of which are noted below and in the Cash Balance Formulas section.
The following explains the formulas applicable to each NEO:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Mr. Bush receives a benefit under a Heritage Formula and a Cash Balance Formula in the Northrop Grumman Retirement Plan, a subplan of the Pension Plan (NGR Subplan). He receives a separate benefit under a Heritage Formula in the S&MS Pension Plan due to his TRW-related service. He ceased to be eligible for future service growth under this plan and the SRIP when he began participating in the NGR Subplan.

โข Mr. Caylor receives a benefit under a Heritage Formula and a Cash Balance Formula in the S&MS Pension Plan. 
โข Mr. Larson does not have a Heritage Formula benefit. He receives benefits from two distinct Cash Balance Formulas: the Old Cash Balance Formula which includes pay-based credits from April 1, 1992 through June 30, 2013 and the New Cash Balance Formula from July 1, 2013. The value of his benefit accrued prior to April 1, 1992 was converted to an opening balance in the Old Cash Balance Formula.

Cash Balance Formulas 
[END TABLE]
The Cash Balance Formula in the Pension Plan and the S&MS Pension Plan is a hypothetical account balance consisting of pay credits plus interest. It has the following features:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Pay credits are a percentage of pay that vary based on an employee's "points" (age plus service) and are credited monthly. The range of percentages applicable to the NEOs on December 31, 2018 was 5.5% โ 9.0%. 
โข Interest is credited at the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rate. The December 31, 2018 interest credit rate was 3.04%. 
โข Eligible pay is salary plus bonus, as limited by Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17). 
โข Eligibility for early retirement occurs at age 55 with 10 years of service. Benefits may be reduced if commenced prior to Normal Retirement Age (65). 
[END TABLE]
The OATK P&R Plan Cash Balance Formulas are also hypothetical account balances consisting of pay credits plus interest. The features of the Old and New Cash Balance Formulas are as follows:
Old Cash Balance Formula (pay credits ceased on June 30, 2013)
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Pay credits are a percentage of pay that vary based on an employee's service. Due to Mr. Larson's service of more than 25 years at June 30, 2013, he was receiving 8.5% of pensionable earnings and an additional 5.5% of earnings in excess of the Social Security Wage Base at that time. 
โข Interest is credited at one-twelfth of the average of the one-year Treasury Constant Maturities during the 12 months ending September 30 of the prior calendar year. The minimum annual interest crediting rate is 3.06%. After June 30, 2013, interest credits continue to apply to this benefit. The post-2018 interest credit rate is assumed to be 3.50% (this is consistent with the valuation of the Old Cash Balance benefit in the Company's financial statements). 
โข Eligible pay is salary plus bonus, as limited by Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17). 
โข Eligibility for early retirement occurs at age 55 with five years of service. Benefits may be reduced if commenced prior to Normal Retirement Age (65).

New Cash Balance Formula (pay credits commenced on July 1, 2013)
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Pay credits are a percentage of pay that vary based on an employee's age plus service and are credited annually at the end of each calendar year or earlier termination. The percentage applicable to Mr. Larson as of December 31, 2018 is 4.0%. 
โข Interest is credited at the end of each year at 4.0%. Interest is prorated for commencements during the calendar year. 
โข Eligible pay is salary plus bonus, as limited by Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17). 
โข After termination of employment, a participant's New Cash Balance benefit may be distributed immediately, regardless of age, in a variety of actuarially equivalent monthly annuities or as a lump sum. 
ERISA 2, SRIP and OATK DB SERP (Nonqualified Restoration Plans) 
[END TABLE]
ERISA 2, SRIP and a portion of OATK DB SERP are nonqualified plans that restore benefits provided for under the Pension Plan, S&MS Pension Plan and OATK P&R Plan, respectively, but for the limits on eligible pay imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17) and the overall benefit limitation of Internal Revenue Code section 415. Benefits and features in these restoration plans otherwise are generally the same as described above for the underlying tax qualified plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
OSERP, OSERP II and OATK DB SERP (Nonqualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans) 
[END TABLE]
These plans provide supplemental pension benefits. They were closed to new hires on or before 2009. In addition, final average pay and associated service under these plans were frozen as of December 31, 2014 or earlier, as noted below.

Deferred Compensation Plans and Descriptions 
[END TABLE]
The deferred compensation plans in which the NEOs participate are listed below, in alphabetical order:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Deferred Compensation Plan is the Northrop Grumman Deferred Compensation Plan. In 2010, this plan was closed to new hires and existing participants ceased to be able to make contributions. Before 2011, eligible executives were allowed to defer a portion of their salary and bonus. No Company contributions were made to the plan. 
โข OATK DC SERP is the Orbital ATK Nonqualified Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. This plan provides contribution credits on behalf of certain heritage Orbital ATK executives, including Mr. Larson. Mr. Larson is eligible for an annual match allocation of 4.5% of compensation in excess of the IRS compensation limit, assuming he has made the maximum allowable before-tax or Roth 401(k) contributions to the 401(k) Plan for the calendar year. 
โข OATK NQ Def Comp is the Orbital ATK Deferred Compensation Plan. The plan allows eligible employees, including Mr. Larson, to defer up to 70% of salary and 100% of cash or equity incentive compensation. The Company may credit to participants' accounts under the plan certain additional amounts relating to matching contributions foregone under the 401(k) Plan due to compensation limits in that plan. The Company may also make additional discretionary contributions to participants' accounts.

โข Officers Retirement Account Contribution Plan (ORAC) is the Northrop Grumman Officers Retirement Account Contribution Plan. This plan allows eligible executives, including NEOs, to receive a Company contribution of 4% of base salary and bonus. 
โข Savings Excess Plan (SEP) is the Northrop Grumman Savings Excess Plan. This plan allows eligible employees, including the NEOs, to (i) defer up to 50% of their salary and bonus beyond the compensation limits of the tax qualified plans and receive a Company matching contribution of up to 4% on a maximum of 8% of pay and (ii) receive RAC contributions beyond the compensation limits in the qualified plans.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
Consistent with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (the pay ratio rule), we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Bush, as of our fiscal year-end December 31, 2018. We believe the pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
In June 2018, we acquired Orbital ATK. The approximately 15,000 Orbital ATK employees are not included in our pay ratio for 2018, as permitted by SEC rules. Excluding the acquisition, there were no significant changes to our global employee population and, our compensation plans remained consistent with the prior year. As such, we do not reasonably believe there have been changes that would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure and, accordingly, are using the same median employee to calculate this year's pay ratio.
We calculated the median employee's annual total compensation in the same manner as the CEO's annual total compensation was calculated in the Summary Compensation Table on page 53. The median employee's annual total compensation was $105,191, which includes other forms of compensation such as financial and wellness benefits. The CEO's annual total compensation was $24,185,259, as reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table. Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 230 : 1. 
Because the CEO pay ratio is intended to provide greater transparency to annual CEO pay and how it compares to the pay of the median employee, we are providing a supplemental ratio that excludes the one-time modification of Mr. Bush's 2017 and 2018 long-term incentive awards from his total annual compensation. The resulting 2018 supplemental ratio was 164 : 1, which we believe allows for better comparability to the prior year.

Terms of Equity Awards 
[END TABLE]
The terms of equity awards granted to the NEOs under the 2011 Plan provide for accelerated vesting if an NEO's employment terminates for certain reasons.
Generally for RPSRs, vesting of a prorated portion of each award occurs from termination due to early retirement, death or disability, and full vesting occurs upon normal retirement (mandatory at age 65), all subject to the Compensation Committee's approval of the earnout percentage based on the RPSR performance metrics for the three-year performance period.
Generally for RSRs, vesting of a prorated portion of each award occurs from termination due to early retirement, and full vesting occurs upon normal retirement (mandatory at age 65), death or disability.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Possible Accelerated Equity Vesting Due to Change in Control 
[END TABLE]
The terms of equity awards to the NEOs under the 2011 Plan provide for possible accelerated vesting of RPSRs and RSRs when the Company is involved in certain types of change in control events, which are more fully described in the 2011 Plan (e.g., certain business combinations after which the Company is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity does not assume the awards). Possible acceleration would occur with respect to RPSRs and RSRs in certain change in control events that result in a termination of the NEO (other than for cause) within the specified period (double trigger). The acceleration of awards requires this double trigger, unless an acquiring company fails to assume the awards. The award terms provide that acceleration will not occur to the extent that it would result in an excise tax that decreases the after-tax value of the awards to an NEO.
In cases where acceleration would occur under these limited change in control provisions, distributions for RPSRs and RSRs would be in full.
The table below provides the estimated value of accelerated equity vesting if such a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018. The estimated value is computed by multiplying unvested shares as of December 31, 2018 by the closing market price of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year ($244.90). For RPSRs, Company performance is assumed to be at target levels through the close of each three-year performance period.

Termination Payments and Benefits 
[END TABLE]
The following table provides estimated payments and benefits that the Company would have provided to each NEO if his or her employment had terminated on December 31, 2018 for the reasons set forth in the table below. The Company stock price is assumed to be $244.90, the closing market price on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year. These payments and benefits are payable based on:

โข the Severance Plan; 
โข the 2011 Plan and the terms and conditions of equity awards made pursuant to the plan; and 
โข the SORMP (Retiree Medical).

Due to the many factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon termination events, actual amounts paid or distributed to NEOs may be different from the values shown in the table. Factors that may affect these amounts include timing during the year of the occurrence of the event, our stock price and the NEO's age. The amounts described below are in addition to an NEO's benefits described in the Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Tables on pages 58 and 63, respectively, as well as benefits generally available to our employees such as distributions under our savings plan, disability or life insurance benefits and accrued vacation.

(3) Long-term Incentives include grants of RPSRs and RSRs. Results in a benefit under Voluntary Termination only if eligible for retirement treatment under the terms and conditions of the grants. 
(4) Represents SORMP benefits outlined in "Key Components of Our Programs - Retiree Medical Arrangement." Mr. Bush is the only NEO eligible for benefits under this plan due to his date of hire and years of service as an executive.

If termination results from death, the retiree medical insurance expense would be less than the disability amount indicated. 
(5) Represents the following benefits under the Severance Plan, assuming a termination date of December 31, 2018: (i) cash severance equivalent to one and a half times the sum of the annual base salary and target annual bonus, (ii) continued medical/dental coverage for the severance period, (iii) financial planning/income tax preparation fees for the year following termination and (iv) outplacement services up to 15% of salary.

PROPOSAL THREE: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee believes that the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and proposes and recommends that the shareholders ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of Deloitte as our independent auditor for 2019. Deloitte served as our independent auditor for 2018, and Deloitte or its predecessors have served as the independent auditor for the Company (including certain of its predecessor companies) since 1975. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, oversight, evaluation and termination, if necessary, of our independent auditor. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and pre-approving audit and non-audit services and related fees for the independent auditor. In addition, the Audit Committee, at least annually, reviews and evaluates with management and our internal auditors Deloitte's performance and periodically considers whether to change the independent auditor. The Audit Committee also reviews the performance of Deloitte's lead audit partner, and the Audit Committee and its Chairperson oversee the rotation of Deloitte's lead audit partner and are involved in the selection of the lead audit partner.
Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Audit Committee is submitting the selection of Deloitte to shareholders as a matter of good corporate governance. If the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment of Deloitte, the Audit Committee will consider this in its selection of auditor for the following year. A representative from Deloitte will attend the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions.

Audit fees for 2018 and 2017 also include $1,834,000 and $1,544,000, respectively, for foreign statutory audits. Fees for foreign statutory audits are reported in the year in which the audits are performed. For example, foreign statutory audit fees reported in 2018 relate to audits of the Company's foreign entities for the fiscal year ended 2017. The remaining 2018 audit fees primarily relate to audit services associated with the Company's acquisition of Orbital ATK, services associated with the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and services associated with the pension accounting method change and Preferability Letter.

Audit-related fees exclude fees that totaled $1,377,000 and $1,423,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to benefit plan audits which are paid for by the plans. 
(3) Tax-related fees during 2018 and 2017 reflect fees of $507,000 and $637,000, respectively, for services concerning foreign income tax compliance, foreign Value Added Tax compliance and other tax matters. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services 
[END TABLE]
It is the Audit Committee's policy to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services provided by our independent auditor in order to provide reasonable assurance that the provision of these services does not impair the auditor's independence. Pre-approval may be given at any time. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority for any individual project up to $100,000 to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee.
The decisions of the Chairperson to pre-approve a permitted service are reported to the Audit Committee at its next meeting. The independent auditor is required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditor in accordance with this pre-approval policy, as well as the fees for the services performed to date.

Proposal Four: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Human Rights Policy 
[END TABLE]
Report on Implementation of Human Rights Policy
2019 - Northrop Grumman Corporation
Whereas: Corporations have a responsibility to respect human rights within company-owned operations and through business relationships under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). To meet this responsibility, companies are expected to conduct human rights due diligence to assess, identify, prevent, mitigate, and remedy adverse human rights impacts. Due diligence should address any human rights impacts a company causes or contributes to through its own business activities and those which are directly linked to its products or services. Meaningful implementation of a human rights policy requires effective due diligence systems.
Northrop Grumman is the third largest government contractor in the United States, and the U.S. Government accounts for 85% of the company's 2017 sales. Developing products and services for the Department of Defense (DoD), the Intelligence Community, and other agencies whose activities may be linked to human rights violations may expose Northrop Grumman to legal, financial, and reputational risks. Therefore, it is essential for the company to conduct human rights due diligence to evaluate and mitigate human rights risks associated with its government contracts.
In February 2018, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $95 million contract with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Biometric Identity Management to develop technology for the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) database.1 This database will expand the capacity of DHS to collect, store, and share biometric data, such as facial images, fingerprints, iris images, and voice, as well as biographical data, including personal identification numbers, citizenship status, and nationality.2 There are concerns that the algorithms used to identify facial images that may be stored in the database have inherent racial bias.3 The HART database will amplify the surveillance capabilities of government agencies, presenting risks to privacy and First Amendment rights and causing harm to immigrant communities. Through the provision of services through the DHS contract, Northrop Grumman may be linked or contribute to these adverse human rights impacts. 
While Northrop Grumman adopted a Human Rights Policy in 2013, it does not disclose how the policy is operationalized to reduce the risks that the company may cause or contribute to adverse human rights impacts. Investors are unable to assess how Northrop Grumman embeds respect for human rights into the process for vetting and implementing contracts with the U.S. Government or foreign governments, or the effectiveness of any systems which may be in place to prevent or mitigate human rights risks. 
Resolved: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors prepare a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, on Northrop Grumman's management systems and processes to implement its Human Rights Policy.
Supporting Statement: We recommend the report include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข The company's human rights due diligence process and indicators used to assess effectiveness; 
โข The role of the Board in oversight of human rights risks; and 
โข Systems to embed respect for human rights into business decision-making processes for its operations, contracts, and supply chain.

PROPOSAL FOUR: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL  
[END TABLE]
The Company is strongly committed to supporting and maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct and respect for human rights. This respect is embedded in the Company's culture, and reflected in the Company's Human Rights Policy adopted in 2013. 
The Human Rights Policy, by its nature, reflects our policies and addresses how they are implemented. For example, the Policy provides that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข The Company treats employees, suppliers, customers and competitors with dignity and respect. The Company does not tolerate any discrimination in employment based on an individual's protected status. Northrop Grumman does not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, bonded labor, or human trafficking. 
โข Northrop Grumman is committed to the highest standards of ethical and business conduct as it relates to the procurement of goods and services. The Company expects suppliers to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the values set forth in our Standards of Business Conduct. 
โข Employees who believe there may have been a violation of this policy should report it through established channels, including to their supervisor, Business Conduct Officer, the Law Department or Human Resources, or the OpenLine. 
โข Northrop Grumman will periodically review this policy to determine whether revisions are appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
The Company's Standards of Business Conduct also reflect our commitment to human rights. Our Standards of Business Conduct, which applies to our directors, officers, employees, consultants and contractors, provide, among other things, for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข The Company's commitment to a culture that values and fosters diversity and inclusion. 
โข The Company will not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital or parental status, pregnancy or childbirth or related conditions, religion, creed, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status or any other protected status. 
โข Reasonable accommodations for qualified persons based on disabilities, religious beliefs and pregnancy/childbirth. 
โข A workplace where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. 
โข Protecting the privacy of others, including the protection of personal information of our employees, contractors, customers and suppliers. 
โข Supporting and enhancing the communities in which our employees live and work, including maintaining outreach programs and partnering with local organizations. The Company does not provide funding or support to organizations that improperly discriminate against others or take positions or actions contrary to our Company values. 
โข Our policies, practices and procedures reflect a strong commitment to human rights as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Company does not condone the use of child or forced labor, indentured servitude, human trafficking or other violations of human rights. The Company expects its partners and suppliers to share this commitment and adopt and enforce principles similar to those in our Human Rights Policy. 
[END TABLE]
Like Proponents, the Board of Directors recognizes the importance of working to ensure that those seeking to do business with the Company also respect basic human rights. The Company states as follows in its most recent Corporate Responsibility Report:
We expect our suppliers will treat others with dignity and respect, encourage diversity, remain receptive to diverse opinions, promote equal opportunity and foster an inclusive and ethical culture. They must refrain from violating the rights of others and address any adverse human rights impact on their operations. This includes child labor, human trafficking, harassment, nondiscrimination, wage and benefit compensation and social dialog.
The Company maintains a Supplier Standards of Business Conduct that also makes clear our commitment to ethical conduct and social responsibility at all tiers of our supply base. These standards are based, in part, on the supplier codes from the Defense Industry Initiative and the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct. The Company's suppliers receive an annual notification about our policies and values. The Company asks our suppliers and those who work with them, including employees and subcontractors, to comply with our Supplier Standards of Business Conduct. The Company regularly communicates our commitments to our suppliers regarding social responsibility and regulatory areas, including EEO/Affirmative Action, conflict minerals, counterfeit parts, anti-human trafficking and cybersecurity. 
The Company also publishes several times a year an Ethics Newsletter that is disseminated to all employees. In June 2018, the focus of the newsletter was Human Rights, and the importance of human rights to all aspects of our business. 
The Company continued to win numerous awards in 2018 recognizing our outstanding ethical culture and respect for human rights. They included:

The Company is committed to respecting human rights and has been transparent about both the Company's policies and how they are implemented. Management holds all employees accountable for protecting and enhancing our culture, including the respect for human rights, and does so subject to active oversight by our Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors believes, however, that this Proposal Four is both unnecessary (we are already committed to robust human rights policies and transparency in how they are implemented) and inappropriate, suggesting unworkable requirements on the day-to-day operations - of the Company and our customers - through a shareholder proposal.
The essence of this proposal appears to us to be aimed not so much at our conduct, but rather at the conduct of the US Government. The focus of Proponents' concern seems to be how our customers will or might use the products we provide and the indirect consequences of the manner in which the US Government deploys them at a given point in time and under various circumstances. To be sure, the Company can and does take seriously the potential consequences of its products and the identity of the customers to whom we can and will sell them. The Company's management systems and processes (on which Proponents seek a report) cannot, however, resolve Proponents' apparent underlying concerns that the Government might use our products in a way that is unacceptable to Proponents.
In addition, we note that much of the relevant information regarding our human rights policy is already publicly available on our website for shareholders to review. Such information includes, for example, our Corporate Responsibility Report, as well as information regarding:

โข Conflicts Minerals Statement  
โข Environmental Sustainability 
โข Environmental Recognition 
โข Global Supplier Diversity Program 
โข Supplier Standards of Business Conduct  
โข Operation IMPACT 
[END TABLE]
It is also important to note that the specific management systems and processes on which Proponents seek a report implicate daily operations and a wide array of business considerations. By seeking to micromanage these processes, the Proposal would infringe on the Company's ability to run its day-to-day business operations.
The Board of Directors and Company management share Proponents' concern for human rights. The Company has previously adopted a strong human rights policy and continually evaluates our programs to implement that policy. The Board of Directors has considered this proposal and appreciates the feedback from Proponents. However, the Board does not believe that the report proposed by Proponents will provide any enhancements to our current human rights policies. To the contrary, the Board believes that this Proposal Four is neither necessary nor an appropriate way to ensure the Company meets its responsibilities. The Board believes strongly that the proposal is not in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. The Board therefore opposes this proposal and recommends that it should not be adopted. 
Vote Required
Approval of this proposal requires that the votes cast "for" the proposal exceed the votes cast "against" the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal.

PROPOSAL FIVE:  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL  
[END TABLE]
Mr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, a beneficial owner of 50 shares of common stock of the Company, the proponent of a shareholder proposal, has stated that he intends to present a proposal at the Annual Meeting. The proposal and supporting statement, for which the Board of Directors accepts no responsibility, is set forth below. The Board of Directors opposes the shareholder proposal for the reasons stated below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal Five: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Independent Board Chairman  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement.
If the Board determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.
This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.
An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the strategic planning capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent.
This proposal is particularly important now because during the Chairman/CEO tenure of Wesley Bush the role of Lead Director was neglected. Donald Felsinger, the former Chairman/CEO of Sempra Energy, was Lead Director and was also on the executive pay committee while Mr. Bush was realizing as much as $41 million in annual pay.
A former Chairman/CEO is inclined to be friendly to a person in the same shoes as he was recently in - but this conflict of interest is not good for shareholders. It is noteable that just before Mr. Felsinger left Sempra Energy (as its Chairman and CEO) that this proposal topic received 55% support from Sempra shareholders.
An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the strategic planning capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company.
Please vote yes:
Independent Board Chairman - Proposal 5
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to Proposal Five 
[END TABLE]
The Company's shareholders have considered, and declined to provide majority support to, similar independent board chairman proposals five times since 2007, with only approximately 25% of votes cast in favor of the proposal when it was last presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors continues to oppose this proposal because it deprives the Board of important flexibility to determine the most effective leadership structure to serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board believes the Company and its shareholders are best served when the Board retains the opportunity to utilize its experience, knowledge and judgment, together with ongoing feedback from our shareholders, to determine which director is best suited to serve as Chair in light of the facts and circumstances at the time, allowing the Board to operate efficiently and effectively to protect and enhance long-term success and shareholder value.
Under our Principles of Corporate Governance, the Board has the authority to determine whether the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer should be held by the same or different persons. The Board has the flexibility to consider what is best for the Company and its shareholders, in light of all facts and circumstances known to the Board at the time. The Board considers a wide range of factors when determining the most effective leadership structure for the Board. These factors include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the role of the Board and the responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director and the Chair;  
โข the experience of the management team;  
โข the particular challenges facing the Company, both at the time and in the near future;  
โข the evolving environment in which we operate and the requirements on management and the Board;  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL FIVE:  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL  
PROPOSAL FIVE:  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the importance of presenting one leadership "face" to our customers; and  
โข the importance of promoting a clear, unified strategic vision for the Company, assuring that strategies adopted by the Board are well-positioned for execution by management. 
[END TABLE]
The Board has previously and effectively used this flexibility to separate the role of Chair and CEO during leadership transitions, and most recently, with the CEO transition from Mr. Bush to Ms. Warden, with Mr. Bush continuing as Board Chair. The practice of separating the roles during leadership transitions so that a company's former CEO or another experienced director can continue to provide perspective to a new CEO is a proven, successful approach among companies and can help to facilitate a seamless leadership transition. It is one example of the advantages to our Company and shareholders of our current Bylaws, which enable the Board to determine the best construct for the Company for the time. Under today's circumstances, and considering in particular Mr. Bush's recent service as our CEO, the Board has determined the Company is best served if Mr. Bush continues as Chairman and if Mr. Felsinger continues as Lead Independent Director, further enhancing the Board's effective exercise of independent judgment and oversight of management. Prior to Mr. Bush's retirement as Chair in July 2019, the Board will re-evaluate and, based on the circumstances as they have evolved, determine the appropriate Board leadership structure.
When the Chair is not independent, the Company's Bylaws specifically provide that the independent directors of the Board may designate a Lead Independent Director from among them. The Board has repeatedly exercised that authority and Mr. Felsinger currently serves as our Lead Independent Director. During his tenure as Lead Independent Director, Mr. Felsinger has engaged with investors and demonstrated strong leadership skills, independent thinking and a deep understanding of our business and our shareholders' interests. Indeed, he was recognized by the NACD as the Director of the Year for 2016, during his service as our Lead Independent Director. 
Our Principles of Corporate Governance prescribe a strong role for our Lead Independent Director, who has significant authority with respect to the operation and functioning of the Board. Among other duties, the Principles of Corporate Governance specify that the Lead Independent Director shall: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข approve meeting agendas and information sent to the Board;  
โข approve the schedule of Board meetings;  
โข call and chair meetings of the independent directors (a regular occurrence at our in-person meetings);  
โข interview Board candidates (along with the Chair and the Chair of the Governance Committee) and help ensure a robust succession plan for Board committees and Board composition;  
โข preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chair is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors;  
โข serve as a liaison between the Chair and the independent directors; and  
โข meet with major shareholders, as requested. Any shareholder is able to communicate directly with the Lead Independent Director as described on page 24 of this Proxy Statement and on the Company's website.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the above responsibilities, the Lead Independent Director has in practice performed additional duties beyond those described in the Principles of Corporate Governance. The Lead Independent Director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข serves as a significant advisor to the Chair, providing guidance and direction to the Chair on a range of significant matters, including strategy, CEO succession, Board succession, shareholder communications and the content/nature of Board meetings;  
โข has discussions on a regular basis with the Chair between Board meetings; 
โข supports and facilitates engagement between the CEO/senior management and independent directors; and 
โข chairs an executive session of independent directors at Board meetings.  
[END TABLE]
The designation of a Lead Independent Director by the independent directors of the Board demonstrates the Board's continuing commitment to strong corporate governance, Board independence and the important role of the Lead Independent Director. In addition, there are several other structural safeguards that provide effective independent oversight by the Board. Eleven of the Company's thirteen directors are independent, and the Board regularly holds scheduled sessions of the independent directors at each Board meeting, which are led by the Lead Independent Director. The Chairs and all members of the Committees - Audit, Compensation, Governance and Policy - are independent directors. The independent directors have ample opportunity to, and regularly do, assess the performance of the CEO and provide meaningful direction. The Board is responsible for the election of the CEO and oversees a robust succession planning process, closely involved in identifying and developing potential successors and effecting orderly CEO transitions.
The Company has adopted numerous other governance practices that further demonstrate our commitment to good corporate governance for our shareholders. We have adopted significant stock ownership guidelines for both our employees and our directors, eliminated change of control agreements, prohibited the hedging and pledging of Company stock, and implemented a strong recoupment policy, to name a few such examples. Our shareholders have approved separate management proposals granting the 
76 I NOTICE OF 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS AND PROXY STATEMENT 
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL FIVE:  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL  
PROPOSAL FIVE:  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL  
[END TABLE]
right to call a special meeting and to act by written consent. Management routinely communicates with shareholders to understand and seek to address any concerns they may have or suggestions as to how we can continue to enhance our governance practices. 
In addition, the Board has successfully recruited, and our shareholders have approved, a diverse group of accomplished, independent directors who bring a wide range of experiences to benefit the Company. The average tenure of our independent directors is 6.5 years, reflecting a healthy mix of tenure and new perspective. As part of its ongoing and active Board refreshment efforts, the Board has added four new independent directors, two of whom were women, in the last four years.
The Board believes that the Company's balanced and flexible corporate governance structure, including a Lead Independent Director with well-defined, comprehensive and meaningful duties, and strong corporate governance practices, make it not only unnecessary, but ill-advised to adopt a policy that would mandate that the Chair be an independent director. The Board believes that adopting such a rule would only limit the Board's ability to select the director it believes is best suited to serve as Chair of the Board, and is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING  
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING  
[END TABLE]
Why did I receive a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" but not a full set of proxy materials? 
We distribute our proxy materials to shareholders via the internet under the "Notice and Access" approach permitted by the rules of the SEC. This approach reduces the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting and our distribution costs, while providing a timely and convenient method of accessing the proxy materials and voting. On March 29, 2019, we mailed a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" to participating shareholders, containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the internet.
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
You may vote your shares of our common stock if you owned your shares as of the close of business on March 19, 2019 (Record Date). As of the Record Date, there were 169,959,030 shares of our common stock outstanding. You may cast one vote for each share of common stock you hold as of the Record Date on all matters presented.
How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting?
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Persons returning executed proxy cards will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum even if they abstain from voting on any or all proposals. Shares held by brokers who vote such shares on any proposal and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
How can I receive a paper copy of the proxy materials?
Instead of mailing a printed copy of this Proxy Statement and accompanying materials to each shareholder of record, we have elected to provide a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice) as permitted by the rules of the SEC. The Notice instructs you as to how you may access and review all of the proxy materials and how you may provide your proxy. If you would like to receive a printed or electronic copy of this Proxy Statement and accompanying materials, you must follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice.
What am I being asked to vote on and what are the Board of Directors' recommendations?

What is a broker non-vote?
Brokers who hold shares of common stock for the accounts of their clients may vote these shares either as directed by their clients or in their own discretion if permitted by the stock exchanges or other organizations of which they are members. Members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are permitted to vote their clients' proxies in their own discretion on certain matters if the clients have not furnished voting instructions within ten days of the meeting. However, NYSE Rule 452 defines various matters as "non-routine," and brokers who have not received instructions from their clients do not have discretion to vote their client's shares on such "non-routine" matters, resulting in a "broker non-vote." 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, your broker has discretionary voting authority under NYSE rules to vote your shares, without instructions from you, on the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent auditor. However, your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares, without instructions from you, on the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs or the shareholder proposals, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters.
How do I vote my shares?
If you hold shares as a record holder, you may vote by proxy prior to the Annual Meeting, as discussed below, or you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by a properly executed proxy will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the shareholder's instructions. If no instructions are given, the shares will be voted according to the recommendations of the Board. Registered shareholders and plan participants may go to www.envisionreports.com/noc to view this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 By Internet Registered shareholders and plan participants may vote on the internet, as well as view the documents, by logging on to www.envisionreports.com/noc and following the instructions given. 
 By Telephone Registered shareholders and plan participants may grant a proxy by calling 800-652-VOTE (800-652-8683) (toll-free) with a touch-tone telephone and following the recorded instructions. 
     By QR Code Registered shareholders and plan participants may vote by scanning the QR code on their proxy card or notice with their mobile device. 
 By Mail Registered shareholders and plan participants must request a paper copy of the proxy materials to receive a proxy card and may vote by marking the voting instructions on the proxy card and following the instructions given for mailing. A paper copy of the proxy materials may be obtained by logging on to www.envisionreports.com/noc and following the instructions given. 
[END TABLE]
If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the proxy card gives discretionary authority to the proxyholders named on the card to vote the shares in their best judgment. A shareholder who executes a proxy may revoke it at any time before its exercise by delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary or by delivering a valid, later-dated proxy, or a later-dated vote by telephone or on the internet, in a timely manner. In addition, a shareholder attending the Annual Meeting in person may revoke the proxy by giving notice of revocation to the inspector of election at the meeting or by voting by ballot at the meeting.
How do I vote my shares if they are held by a bank, broker or other agent?
Persons who own stock beneficially through a bank, broker or other agent may not vote directly and will need to instruct the record owner to vote their shares using the procedure identified by the bank, broker or other agent. Beneficial owners who hold our common stock in "street name" through a broker receive voting instruction forms from their broker. Most beneficial owners will be able to provide voting instructions by telephone or on the internet by following the instructions on the form they receive from their broker. Beneficial owners may view this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report on the internet by logging on to www.edocumentview.com/noc. A person who beneficially owns shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other agent can vote his or her shares in person at the Annual Meeting only if he or she obtains from the bank, broker or other nominee a proxy, often referred to as a "legal proxy," to vote those shares, and presents the proxy to the inspector of election at the meeting together with his or her ballot.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial owners who hold shares in "street name" may revoke a proxy or change a vote by submitting a new, later-dated voting instruction form, contacting the bank, broker or other agent or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting by obtaining a legal proxy as described above.
How do I vote my shares held under a Northrop Grumman savings plan?
If shares are held on an individual's behalf under any of our savings plans, the proxy will serve to provide confidential instructions to the plan Trustee or Voting Manager who then votes the participant's shares in accordance with the individual's instructions. For those participants who do not vote their plan shares, the applicable Trustee or Voting Manager will vote their plan shares in the same proportion as shares held under the plan for which voting directions have been received, unless the Employee Retirement Income Security Act requires a different procedure.
Voting instructions from savings plan participants must be received by the applicable plan Trustee or Voting Manager by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 12, 2019 in order to be used by the plan Trustee or Voting Manager to determine the votes cast with respect to plan shares.

APPENDIX A - USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
[END TABLE]
This Proxy Statement contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC Regulation G and indicated by an asterisk in this Proxy Statement. While we believe investors and other users of our financial statements may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating our financial performance and operational trends, they should be considered as supplemental in nature, and therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Definitions and reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Proxy Statement are provided below. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP financial measures.
Certain of the non-GAAP financial measures below are used as internal measures for performance-based compensation decisions, as further discussed in the "Key Components of our Programs" section of Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The Compensation Committee has discretion to make adjustments to these measures in instances where the Company's performance has been impacted by unforeseen or unusual events. For 2018, the Compensation Committee adjusted the calculation of certain of these measures in order to exclude the impact of certain events or transactions that were not contemplated when the performance metrics were established.
Cash flow metrics: We use cash flow metrics as internal measures of financial performance and for performance-based compensation decisions. We also use these measures as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, payments of dividends and share repurchases. The following cash flow metrics may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Cash provided by operating activities before after-tax discretionary pension contribution: Cash provided by operating activities before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Cash provided by operating activities before after-tax discretionary pension contributions is reconciled below. 
Pension-adjusted cash flow from operations: Cash provided by operating activities before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. As approved by the Compensation Committee, this metric has been adjusted to exclude the impacts of the addition of Innovation Systems and Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses. Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses are primarily comprised of advisory, legal and other costs related to the completion of the transaction. Pension-adjusted cash flow from operations is reconciled below.
Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is reconciled below.
Free cash flow before after-tax total pension funding: Free cash flow before the after-tax impact of total pension funding. As approved by the Compensation Committee, this metric has been adjusted to exclude the impacts of the addition of Innovation Systems and Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses. Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses are primarily comprised of advisory, legal and other costs related to the completion of the transaction. Free cash flow before after-tax total pension funding is reconciled below.
Cumulative free cash flow: The aggregate free cash flow before the after-tax impact of total pension funding over a three-year period. 
Pension-adjusted metrics: For financial statement purposes, we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with GAAP (FAS). However, the cost of these plans is charged to our contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the related U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) that govern such plans. We use pension-adjusted metrics as internal measures of financial performance and for performance-based compensation decisions. The following pension-adjusted measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance based upon the pension costs charged to our contracts. 
Net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment: The difference between pension expense charged to contracts and included as cost in segment operating income in accordance with CAS and the service cost component of pension expense determined in accordance with FAS. Net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment is presented below.
Pension-adjusted operating income: Operating income before the net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment as defined above. As approved by the Compensation Committee, this metric has been adjusted to exclude Innovation Systems operating income, intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation, and Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses, which were not contemplated when the performance metrics were established for 2018. Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses are primarily comprised of advisory, legal and other costs related to the completion of the transaction. Pension-adjusted operating income is reconciled below. 
Pension-adjusted operating margin rate: Pension-adjusted operating income as defined above, divided by sales (excluding Innovation Systems sales). Pension-adjusted operating margin rate is reconciled below.

APPENDIX A - USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
[END TABLE]
Total net FAS/CAS pension adjustment: The combined net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment and net FAS (non-service) pension benefit. 
After-tax net pension adjustment: The net income impact, after tax at the statutory rate of 21 percent, of the net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment and net FAS (non-service) pension benefit as defined above. After-tax net pension adjustment is presented below. 
Pension-adjusted net income: Net income before the after-tax net pension adjustment as defined above. As approved by the Compensation Committee, this metric has been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Company's 2018 MTM pension expense, Innovation Systems operating income, intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation, and Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses. Orbital ATK transaction-related expenses are primarily comprised of advisory, legal and other costs related to the completion of the transaction. Pension-adjusted net income is reconciled below. 
Segment operating income: Total earnings from our four segments including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and the service cost component of FAS pension expense. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. Segment operating income is reconciled below.
Segment operating margin rate: Segment operating income as defined above, and reconciled below, divided by sales. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors.
MTM-adjusted net earnings: Net earnings excluding MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the Company's underlying financial performance by presenting the Company's operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. This measure is also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management's assessment of the Company's operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. MTM-adjusted net earnings is reconciled below.
MTM-adjusted diluted EPS: Diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the Company's underlying financial performance per share by presenting the Company's diluted earnings per share results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. MTM-adjusted diluted EPS is reconciled below.
