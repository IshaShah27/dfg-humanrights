 PROXY STATEMENT
 _________________
 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
 TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 23, 2019
_________________
 Solicitation of Proxies
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by and on behalf of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Scientific Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for use at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at La Quinta Inn & Suites, 10 Aero Road, Bohemia, New York, 11716, on Wednesday, January 23, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. (New York time), and at any adjournments or postponements thereof.
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company will be asked to: (1) elect two Directors of the Company to serve until the Company's annual meeting of stockholders with respect to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and the election and qualification of their successors; (2) ratify the appointment of Nussbaum Yates Berg Klein & Wolpow, LLP, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019; and (3) transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof.
 Record Date, Voting Rights
Only stockholders of record of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.05 per share (the "Common Stock"), as of the close of business on November 28, 2018 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. On the Record Date, there were 1,513,914 shares of Common Stock issued and 1,494,112 outstanding. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote.
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by a properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock as of the Record Date is necessary to constitute a quorum. In the determination of the number of shares of Common Stock present at the Annual Meeting for quorum purposes abstentions and broker "non-votes" are included. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares of Common Stock for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.
 Voting of Proxies, Revocation, Solicitation
All stockholders who deliver properly executed and dated proxies to the Company prior to the Annual Meeting will be deemed present at the Annual Meeting regardless of whether such proxies direct the proxy holders to vote for or against, or to withhold or abstain from voting. The proxies, when properly executed and returned to the Company, will be voted in accordance with the instructions given therein by the person executing the proxy. In the absence of instructions, properly executed proxies other than with respect to broker "non-votes" will be voted FOR (1) the election of the Board's nominees, Ms. Helena R. Santos and Mr. James S. Segasture as Class A Directors of the Company; and (2) the ratification of the appointment by the Board of Directors of Nussbaum Yates Berg Klein & Wolpow, LLP, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
Any stockholder who executes and delivers a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted by delivering a written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Company at the address of the Company set forth in this proxy statement, by submitting a properly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by appearing at the Annual Meeting and requesting the return of the proxy or by voting in person. In accordance with applicable rules, boxes and designated spaces are provided on the proxy card for stockholders to mark if they wish either to vote for or withhold authority to vote for the nominees for Directors, or to vote for, against or to abstain from voting for the proposal to ratify the appointment by the Board of Directors of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
A stockholder's attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy given by that stockholder. Stockholders vote at the Annual Meeting by casting ballots (in person or by proxy), which are tabulated by a person who is appointed by the Board of Directors before the Annual Meeting to serve as inspector of election at the Annual Meeting and who has executed and verified an oath of office.
It is anticipated that this proxy statement, the enclosed proxy card, and the Company's Annual Report will be mailed to the Company's stockholders on or about December 10, 2018.

 PROPOSAL 1
 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 General
The Company's Certificate of Incorporation provides for a classified Board of Directors, consisting of three classes, each class serving a three-year term on a staggered basis. Two are Class A Directors, one is a Class B Director, and two are Class C Directors. At the Annual Meeting, the two Class A Directors are to be elected to serve until the annual meeting of stockholders with respect to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"), the Board held three meetings, at each of which all Directors were present. Shares of Common Stock represented by executed and returned proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted for the nominees hereinafter named if authority to do so is not specifically withheld. If for any reason said nominee shall become unavailable for election, which is not now anticipated, the proxies will be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors.
The Directors of the Company are elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. A plurality means that the nominee with the largest number of votes is elected as Director. In tabulating the vote, abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be disregarded and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
 The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the election of the nominees identified below to the Board of Directors.

The Compensation Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to each executive officer. Executive compensation, in all instances except for the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), is based on recommendations from the CEO. The CEO makes a determination by comparing the performance of each executive being reviewed with objectives established at the beginning of each fiscal year and with objectives established during the business year with regard to the success of the achievement of such objectives and the successful execution of management targets and goals.
  With respect to the compensation of the CEO, the Committee considers performance criteria, 50% of which is related to the direction, by the CEO, of the reporting executives, the establishment of executive objectives as components for the successful achievement of Company goals and the successful completion of programs leading to the successful completion of the business plan for the Company and 50% is based on the achievement by the Company of its financial and personnel goals tempered by the amount of the income or loss of the Company during the fiscal year.
 The compensation at times includes grants of options under its stock option plan to the named executives. Each officer is employed pursuant to a long-term employment agreement, containing terms proposed by the Committee and approved as reasonable by the Board of Directors. The Board is cognizant that as a relatively small company, the Company has limited resources and opportunities with respect to recruiting and retaining key executives. Accordingly, the Company has relied upon long-term employment agreements and grants of stock options to retain qualified personnel.
Compensation for each of its executive officers provided by their employment agreements were based on the foregoing factors and the operating and financial results of the segments under their management.
The following table summarizes all compensation paid by the Company to each of its executive officers for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

 PROPOSAL 2
 APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors, subject to stockholders' approval, appointed Nussbaum Yates Berg Klein & Wolpow, LLP (the "Firm") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The Firm has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company since 1991. A representative of the Firm is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, and will have an opportunity to make a statement to the stockholders and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. The ratification of the appointment will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions will be included in determining the number of shares of Common Stock present or represented and entitled to vote for purposes of approval and will have the effect of votes "against" the proposal. Broker "non-votes" will not be counted in determining the number of shares of Common Stock present or represented and entitled to vote to approve the proposal and will therefore not have the effect of votes either "for" or "against".
Stockholder ratification of the appointment is not required by the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or otherwise. If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Board of Directors will reconsider whether to retain that firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Board of Directors in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee, currently the entire Board of Directors, determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
The following is a description of the fees incurred by the Company for services by the firm of Nussbaum Yates Berg Klein & Wolpow, LLP (the "Firm") during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
The Company incurred for the services of the Firm fees of approximately $70,000 and $69,000 for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, in connection with the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and quarterly reviews; and $6,000 for each fiscal year for the preparation of the Company's corporate tax returns.
In approving the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform the audit and non-audit services, the Board of Directors as the Company's audit committee evaluates the scope and cost of each of the services to be performed including a determination that the performance of the non-audit services will not affect the independence of the firm in the performance of the audit services.
 The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Nussbaum Yates Berg Klein & Wolpow, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
