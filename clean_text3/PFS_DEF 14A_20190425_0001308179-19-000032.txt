The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, April 25, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Renaissance Woodbridge Hotel, 515 U.S. Highway 1 South, Iselin, New Jersey.
A Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials is first being sent to our stockholders on March 15, 2019.
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
Date, Time and Place: Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on April 25, 2019, 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Renaissance Woodbridge Hotel, 515 U.S. Highway 1 South, Iselin, New Jersey 
Record Date: March 1, 2019.
Shares Entitled to Vote: 66,592,587 shares of Provident common stock were outstanding on the record date and are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Purpose of the Annual Meeting: To consider and vote on the election of four directors, an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers, approval of the 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, and the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Vote Required: Subject to our majority voting policy described under the heading "Corporate Governance Matters" in this Proxy Statement, directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, without regard to either broker non-votes or proxies as to which authority to vote for the nominees proposed is withheld. The advisory vote to approve executive compensation, the approval of the long-term equity incentive plan and the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm are each determined by a majority of the votes cast, without regard to broker non-votes or proxies marked "ABSTAIN".
Board Recommendation: Our board of directors recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" each of the nominees for director listed in this Proxy Statement, "FOR" approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers, FOR the approval of the 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, and "FOR" the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Provident: Provident is a Delaware corporation and the bank holding company for Provident Bank, an FDIC-insured New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank that operates a network of full-service branch offices throughout northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. Our principal executive offices are located at 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302. Our telephone number is (732) 590-9200.
Who Can Vote
March 1, 2019 is the record date for determining the stockholders of record who are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On March 1, 2019, 66,592,587 shares of Provident common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, were outstanding and held by approximately 4,745 holders of record. The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting.
How Many Votes You Have
Each holder of shares of our common stock outstanding on March 1, 2019 will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record. However, our certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders of record who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock are not entitled to vote any of the shares held in excess of that 10% limit. A person or entity is deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an affiliate of, as well as by any person acting in concert with, such person or entity.
Matters to Be Considered
The purpose of the Annual Meeting is to elect four directors, vote on an advisory basis on executive compensation, approve the 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, and ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. We may adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting for the purpose of allowing additional time to solicit proxies.
Our board of directors is not aware of any other matters that may be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, we intend that shares represented by properly submitted proxies will be voted, or not voted, by the persons named as proxies in their best judgment.
How to Vote
You may vote your shares:
If you return an executed Proxy Card without marking your instructions, your executed Proxy Card will be voted "FOR" the election of the four nominees for director, "FOR" approval of the executive compensation paid to our named executive officers, "FOR" the approval of the 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Participants in Provident Benefit Plans
If you are a participant in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan or 401(k) Plan, or any other benefit plans sponsored by us through which you own shares of our common stock, you will have received a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials by e-mail. Under the terms of these plans, the trustee or administrator votes all shares held by the plan, but each participant may direct the trustee or administrator how to vote the shares of our common stock allocated to his or her plan account. If you own shares through any of these plans and you do not vote by April 21, 2019, the respective plan trustees or administrators will vote your shares in accordance with the terms of the respective plans.
Quorum and Vote Required
The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (unvoted proxies submitted by a bank or broker) will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
Subject to our majority voting policy described under the heading "Corporate Governance Matters" in this Proxy Statement, directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, without regard to either broker non-votes or proxies as to which authority to vote for the nominees proposed is "Withheld." The advisory vote on executive compensation, the approval of the long-term equity incentive plan, and the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm are each determined by a majority of the votes cast, without regard to broker non-votes or proxies marked "Abstain."
Revocability of Proxies
You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by:
Written notices of revocation and other communications regarding the revocation of your proxy should be addressed to:
Provident Financial Services, Inc.
100 Wood Avenue South   P.O. Box 1001   Iselin, New Jersey 08830-1001
If your shares are held in street name, you should follow your bank's or broker's instructions regarding the revocation of proxies.
Solicitation of Proxies
Provident will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from you. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, we will request that banks, brokers and other holders of record send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. We will reimburse such holders of record for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions. Equiniti (US) Services LLC will assist us in soliciting proxies, and we have agreed to pay them a fee of $5,000 plus reasonable expenses for their services. If necessary, we may also use several of our employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from stockholders, personally or by telephone, facsimile, e-mail or letter.
Householding
Unless you have provided us contrary instructions, we have sent a single copy of these proxy materials to any household at which one or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same household. Each stockholder in the household will receive a separate Proxy Card. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information and helps reduce our expenses. If you would like to receive your own set of proxy materials, please follow these instructions:
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Your board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the nominees for director listed in this Proxy Statement, "FOR" approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers, "FOR" approval of the 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, and "FOR" the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
Persons and groups who beneficially own in excess of five percent of Provident's issued and outstanding shares of common stock are required to file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding such beneficial ownership. The following table shows, as of March 1, 2019, certain information as to persons who beneficially owned more than five percent of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. We know of no persons, except as listed below, who beneficially owned more than five percent of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of March 1, 2019.
Principal Stockholders
Management
The following table shows certain information about shares of our common stock owned by each nominee for election as director, each incumbent director whose term of office continues following the Annual Meeting, each named executive officer identified in the summary compensation table included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, and all nominees, incumbent directors and executive officers as a group, as of March 1, 2019.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers and anyone holding 10% or more of our common stock (reporting persons) to file reports with the SEC showing the holdings of, or transactions in, our common stock. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports, and written representations from each such reporting person that no other reports were required, we believe that in 2018 all reporting persons filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a).
Proposal 1 Election of Directors
General
Our board of directors currently consists of ten members and is divided into three classes, with one class of directors elected each year. Each member of our board of directors also serves as a director of Provident Bank. Directors are elected to serve for a three-year term and until their respective successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director is not eligible to be elected or appointed to either board of directors after reaching age 73.
Four directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve for a three-year term and until their respective successors shall have been elected and qualified. On the recommendation of our Governance/Nominating Committee, our board of directors nominated Thomas W. Berry, James P. Dunigan, Frank L. Fekete and Matthew K. Harding for election as directors at the Annual Meeting.
All of the nominees for election at the Annual Meeting currently serve as directors of Provident and Provident Bank, and other than Mr. Dunigan, each of them was previously elected by our stockholders. Mr. Dunigan was recommended for consideration by the non-management directors and was appointed to the boards of directors of Provident and Provident Bank on May 24, 2018. No arrangements or understandings exist between any nominee and any other person pursuant to which any such nominee was selected. Unless authority to vote for any or all of the nominees is withheld, it is intended that the shares represented by each fully executed Proxy Card will be voted "FOR" the election of all nominees.
Each of the nominees has consented to be named a nominee. In the event that any nominee is unable to serve as a director, the persons named as proxies will vote with respect to a substitute nominee designated by our current board of directors. At this time, we know of no reason why any of the nominees would be unable or would decline to serve, if elected.
Board of Directors
Our board of directors is comprised of individuals with considerable and varied business experiences, backgrounds, skills and qualifications. Collectively, they have a strong knowledge of our company's business, strategy and markets and are committed to enhancing long-term stockholder value.
Our Governance/Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and selecting director candidates who meet the evolving needs of our board of directors. Director candidates must have the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity. Additional criteria weighed by the Governance/Nominating Committee in the director identification and selection process include the relevance of a candidate's experience to our business, enhancement of the diversity of experience of our board, the candidate's independence from conflict or direct economic relationship with our company, and the candidate's ability and willingness to devote the proper time to prepare for, attend and participate in meetings. The Governance/Nominating Committee also takes into account whether a candidate satisfies the criteria for independence under our Independence Standards and the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, and if a nominee is sought for service on the Audit Committee, the financial and accounting expertise of a candidate, including whether the candidate qualifies as an Audit Committee financial expert.
While the Governance/Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy regarding diversity on our board of directors, consideration is given to nominating persons with different perspectives and experience to enhance the deliberation and strategic decision-making processes of our board of directors.
The following table states the name, the year service as a director commenced, and the term expiration date for each of our nominees for election as directors and each incumbent director whose term of office continues following the Annual Meeting.
The age and business experience of each of our nominees for election as directors and the incumbent directors whose term of office continues following the Annual Meeting, and directorships held by them with other public companies during the past five years, as well as their qualifications, attributes and skills that led our board of directors to conclude that each such person should serve as a director are as follows:

CorporateGovernance Matters
Our board of directors and management are committed to maintaining sound corporate governance principles and the highest standards of ethical conduct. We are in compliance with applicable corporate governance laws and regulations. The following are some key features of our corporate governance practices:
Board of Directors Meetings and Committees
Our board of directors meets quarterly, or more often as may be necessary. The board of directors met eight times in 2018. There are five standing committees of the board of directors: the Audit, Compensation, Risk, Technology and Governance/Nominating Committees. The board of directors of Provident Bank meets monthly at least 11 times a year, as required by New Jersey banking law.
All directors attended no fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings held by the board of directors and all committees of the board on which they served (during the period they served) in 2018. When the Provident and Provident Bank board of directors and committee meetings are aggregated, all directors attended no fewer than 75% of the aggregated total number of meetings in 2018. We have a policy requiring each director to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All persons serving on the board of directors at the time of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 26, 2018 attended the meeting.
Board Leadership Structure
Our board of directors believes that combining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions, together with the appointment of an independent Lead Director, is the appropriate board leadership structure for our company. Carlos Hernandez currently serves as the Lead Director. Our board of directors has determined that the Chief Executive Officer is most knowledgeable about our business and corporate strategy, and is in the best position to lead the board of directors, especially in relation to its oversight of corporate strategy formation and execution. Management accountability and our board's independence from management are best served by maintaining a super majority of independent directors, electing an independent Lead Director, and maintaining standing board committees that are comprised of independent leadership and members. The Lead Director plays an important role on our board of directors and has the following responsibilities:
Risk Oversight/Risk Committee
Our entire board of directors is engaged in risk management oversight. A separate standing Risk Committee of the board facilitates our board's risk oversight responsibilities. The current members of the Risk Committee are: Ms. Brooks (Chair) and Messrs. Adamo, Berry and Dunigan. Each member of the Risk Committee is considered independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards. The Risk Committee's charter is posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank. The Committee met seven times during 2018.
The Risk Committee oversees the overall risk management activities employed by management in pursuit of:
Our Risk Committee receives regular reports from management and other standing board committees regarding relevant risks and the actions taken by management to adequately address and mitigate those risks.
Corporate Governance Principles
Our board of directors has adopted Corporate Governance Principles which are posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank. These Corporate Governance Principles cover the general operating policies and procedures followed by our board of directors including:
The Corporate Governance Principles provide for our board of directors to meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without management at least two times a year. Five executive sessions were conducted in 2018. The Lead Director presided over these executive sessions conducted by the non-management directors, all of whom are independent.
Director Independence
The New York Stock Exchange rules provide that a director does not qualify as independent unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with the company. The New York Stock Exchange rules require our board of directors to consider all relevant facts and circumstances in determining the materiality of a director's relationship with Provident and permit the board of directors to adopt and disclose standards to assist the board in making independence determinations. Accordingly, our board of directors has adopted Independence Standards to assist the board in determining whether a director has a material relationship with the company. These Independence Standards, which should be read with the New York Stock Exchange rules, are available on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank.
Our board of directors conducted an evaluation of director independence, based on the Independence Standards and the New York Stock Exchange rules. In connection with this review, our board of directors considered relevant facts and circumstances relating to relationships that each director and his or her immediate family members and their related interests had with Provident. In connection with its evaluation of director independence, the board considered the following relationships and transactions:
After its evaluation, our board of directors affirmatively determined that Messrs. Adamo, Berry, Dunigan, Fekete, Gallagher, Harding, Hernandez, and Pugliese and Ms. Brooks is each an independent director. The board of directors determined that Mr. Martin is not independent because he serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Provident.
Governance/Nominating Committee
The current members of our Governance/Nominating Committee are: Messrs. Hernandez (Chair), Berry, Fekete, and Gallagher. Each member of the Committee is considered independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards. The Committee's charter is posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank. The Committee met six times during 2018.
The functions of our Governance/Nominating     Committee include, among other things:
Our Governance/Nominating Committee identifies nominees for director by first assessing the performance, qualifications and skills of the current members of our board of directors willing to continue service. Current members of the board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue service are first considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the board with that of obtaining a new perspective. In the case of a current member of the board of directors, prior to re- nomination an evaluation of the board member's performance is conducted by the Governance/Nominating Committee using a written self- evaluation submitted by the current member and input from each other director obtained by the Lead Director. The Lead Director provides feedback to each current member being considered for re-nomination based on the input received from other directors.
If a vacancy should exist on our board, or if the size of the board is increased, the Committee will solicit suggestions for director candidates from all board members. In addition, the Committee is authorized by its charter to engage a third party to assist in the identification of director nominees. Persons under consideration to serve on our board of directors must have the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity.
Annual Board Performance Evaluation
Each year the board of directors conducts an evaluation of the board's performance that seeks feedback from directors on the functioning of the board, including the board's committee structure and leadership, culture, process and resources. Typically, this evaluation is conducted using written questionnaires and the responses are reviewed with the Governance/Nominating Committee and at an executive session of the board conducted by the Lead Director. The board of directors has utilized, and annually considers the use of a third party to assist it in the annual performance evaluation.
Procedures for the Recommendation of Directors by Stockholders
If a determination is made that an additional candidate is needed for our board, the Governance/Nominating Committee will consider candidates properly submitted by our stockholders. Stockholders can submit the names of qualified candidates for director by writing to the Corporate Secretary at Provident Financial Services, Inc., 100 Wood Avenue South, P.O. Box 1001, Iselin, New Jersey 08830-1001. The Corporate Secretary must receive a submission not less than 120 days prior to the date of Provident's proxy materials for the preceding year's Annual Meeting. A stockholder's submission must be in writing and include the following information:
Stockholder submissions that are timely and that meet the criteria outlined above will be forwarded to the Chair of our Governance/Nominating Committee for further review and consideration. A nomination submitted by a stockholder for presentation at an Annual Meeting of our stockholders must comply with the procedural and informational requirements described later in this Proxy Statement under the heading "Advance Notice Of Business To Be Conducted at an Annual Meeting."
Majority Voting Policy
Our board of directors believes that each director should have the confidence and support of our stockholders. To that end, the board has adopted a majority voting policy that applies in uncontested elections of directors at a stockholders' meeting. The policy is not applicable in any contested director election. Under the majority voting policy, any incumbent director nominee in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" than votes cast "FOR" at a stockholders meeting shall promptly tender his or her proposed resignation following the certification of the stockholder vote.
The Governance/Nominating Committee will promptly consider the resignation and will recommend to the board whether to accept the resignation or take other action, including rejecting the resignation and addressing any apparent underlying causes of the failure of the director to obtain a majority of votes "FOR" his or her election. The board will act on the Governance/Nominating Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote. The company will publicly disclose the board's decision and process in a periodic or current report filed with or furnished to the SEC within 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote. Any director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Governance/Nominating Committee's or full board's deliberations, considerations or actions regarding whether or not to accept or reject the resignation or take any related action.
Stockholder and Interested Party Communications with the Board
Our stockholders and any other interested party may communicate with the board of directors, the non-management directors, the Lead Director or with any individual director by writing to the Chair of the Governance/Nominating Committee, c/o Provident Financial Services, Inc., 100 Wood Avenue South, P.O. Box 1001, Iselin, New Jersey 08830-1001. A communication from a stockholder should indicate that the author is a stockholder and, if shares of our common stock are not held of record, the letter should include appropriate evidence of stock ownership.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, and all persons performing similar functions. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank. Amendments to and waivers from our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will also be disclosed on Provident Bank's website.
Transactions With Certain Related Persons
Federal laws and regulations generally require that all loans or extensions of credit by Provident Bank to directors and executive officers must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the general public and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. However, regulations also permit directors and executive officers to receive the same terms through benefit or compensation plans that are widely available to other employees, as long as the director or executive officer is not given preferential treatment compared to participating employees.
As of December 31, 2018, Provident Bank had aggregate loans and loan commitments totaling $57,739 to its executive officers, none of which originated in 2018. It is the policy of Provident Bank that no loan or extension of credit of any type shall be made to any member of the board of directors or to their immediate family, or to any entity which is controlled by a member of the board of directors or their immediate family.
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires directors and executive officers to promptly disclose any interest they may have in any proposed transaction involving Provident or Provident Bank, and any such director or executive officer shall abstain from any deliberation or voting on the transaction. Any such transaction requires the approval of a majority of the directors who have no interest in the proposed transaction. In addition, our directors and executive officers annually disclose any transactions, relationships or arrangements they or their related interests may have with Provident or Provident Bank. These disclosures, together with information obtained from each director's annual statement of interest form, are used to monitor related party transactions and make independence determinations.
Anti-Hedging Policy
Our stock trading policy prohibits our directors, officers and employees from engaging in any transaction designed to hedge or offset the economic risk of owning shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any hedging, derivative or other similar transaction that is specifically designed to reduce or limit the extent to which declines in the trading price of our common stock would affect the value of the shares of common stock owned by a director, officer or employee is prohibited. In addition, the policy provides that our directors, officers and employees should avoid pledging their shares of our common stock as collateral for a margin account or loan.
Technology Committee
Our board of directors formed a Technology Committee in April, 2018. The current members of our Technology Committee are: Messrs. Pugliese (Chair) and Harding and Ms. Brooks. Each member of the Technology Committee is considered independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards.
The Technology Committee assists the board of directors in its oversight responsibility of our technology strategy, including trends and significant investments, and technology-related risks. The Technology Committee met three times in 2018. Our Technology Committee operates under a written charter approved by our board of directors, which is posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank.
Audit Committee Matters
Audit Committee
The current members of our Audit Committee are: Messrs. Fekete (Chair), Adamo, Dunigan, and Harding. Each member of the Audit Committee is considered independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards and under SEC Rule 10A-3.
The duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee include, among other things:
Our Audit Committee met ten times during 2018. The Audit Committee reports to our board of directors on its activities and findings. The board of directors believes that Messrs. Adamo and Fekete each qualify as an Audit Committee financial expert as that term is defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Audit Committee Report
Pursuant to rules and regulations of the SEC, this Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that Provident specifically incorporates this information by reference, and otherwise shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC subject to Regulation 14A or 14C of the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Our Audit Committee operates under a written charter approved by our board of directors, which is posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank.
Management has primary responsibility for the internal control and financial reporting process, and for making an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and to issue an opinion on those financial statements, and for providing an attestation report on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.
As part of its ongoing activities, our Audit Committee has:
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to our board of directors that the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and related notes be included in Provident's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and filed with the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee approved the re-appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, subject to the ratification of this appointment by our stockholders.

Compensation Committee Matters
Compensation Committee
The current members of our Compensation Committee are: Messrs. Gallagher (Chair), Harding and Pugliese and Ms. Brooks. Each member of the Compensation Committee has been determined to be independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards. The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing the performance of, and the compensation payable to, our named executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer; the compensation payable to our non-management directors; management development and succession planning; and reviewing and evaluating incentive compensation plans and risks associated with such plans. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for the engagement of the compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"). The Compensation Committee's oversight of our incentive compensation plans includes setting corporate performance measures and goals consistent with principles of safety and soundness, approving awards and administering long-term equity awards.
Director compensation is established by our board of directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee and is discussed in this Proxy Statement under the heading "Director Compensation."
The Compensation Committee's charter is posted on the "Governance Documents" section of the "Investor Relations" page of Provident Bank's website at www.provident.bank. The Compensation Committee met seven times during 2018.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Messrs. Gallagher, Harding, and Pugliese and Ms. Brooks served as members of the Compensation Committee during 2018. None of these directors has ever been an officer or employee of Provident and, none of them are executive officers of any other entity where one of our executive officers serves on the compensation committee or the board of directors, or which had any transactions or relationships with us in 2018 that would require specific disclosures in this Proxy Statement under SEC rules.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
The following discussion provides an overview and analysis of our Compensation Committee's philosophy and objectives in designing Provident's compensation programs, as well as the compensation determinations and rationale for those determinations relating to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the next three most highly compensated executive officers whom we collectively refer to as our "named executive officers." Our named executive officers for 2018 were:
Executive Summary
Our executive compensation program is designed to align pay with performance in a manner consistent with safe and sound business practices and sustainable financial performance consistent with our stockholders interests. The key features of our executive compensation program are:
Financial and Strategic Highlights
Our Compensation Committee believes that executive compensation should be linked to Provident's overall financial performance and strategic success and the contribution of its executives to that performance.
Highlights of Provident's 2018 financial and operating performance include:
Key Executive Compensation Actions
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the components of our executive compensation program with advice from its independent compensation consultant and after giving due consideration to the most recent nonbinding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation which resulted in a favorable vote of approximately 97% of the votes cast on the matter.
Highlights of key compensation actions taken in 2018 were:
Compensation Consultants
Our Compensation Committee retained the services of FW Cook to assist with compensation planning and analysis. FW Cook was retained by and reported directly to the Compensation Committee and did not perform any other services for Provident, Provident Bank or their affiliates or their management. The Compensation Committee periodically meets with its compensation consultant in executive session without management.
The Compensation Committee considered the independence of FW Cook in light of SEC rules and New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards, and received a report from FW Cook addressing the independence of the firm and its consultants, which included the following factors: (1) that no other services were provided to Provident; (2) fees paid by Provident as a percentage of the firm's total revenue; (3) policies or procedures maintained by the firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) that there were no business or personal relationships between the firm and its consultants and any member of the Compensation Committee; (5) any company stock owned by the firm and its consultants; and (6) that there were no business or personal relationships between Provident's executive officers and the firm and its consultants. The Compensation Committee discussed these considerations and concluded that the work performed by FW Cook and its consultants involved in the engagement did not raise any conflict of interest and concluded that they were independent Compensation Committee consultants.
Executive Compensation Philosophy
Our Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program is consistent with promoting sound risk management and long-term value creation for our stockholders. The program is intended to align the interests of our executive officers and employees with stockholders by rewarding performance against established corporate financial goals, strong executive leadership and superior individual performance. By offering annual cash incentives, long-term equity compensation and competitive benefits, we strive to attract, motivate and retain a highly qualified and talented team of executives who will help maximize long-term financial performance and earnings growth.
The total compensation paid to each named executive officer is based on the executive's level of job responsibility, corporate financial and market performance measured against annual and three-year goals, an assessment of the executive's individual performance and the competitive market. For the named executive officers and other members of executive management, annual and long-term incentive compensation is linked more directly to corporate financial performance, because these executives are in leadership roles that influence corporate financial results.
Benchmarking and Peer Groups
The Compensation Committee is responsible for the design, implementation and administration of the compensation program for our executive officers. FW Cook was engaged in 2017 to review our executive compensation program for 2018, which included a review and recommendation of an appropriate peer group for assessing competitive compensation practices, and for making performance comparisons. The Compensation Committee used the following two peer groups when making its 2018 executive compensation determinations:
The individual peer banks remained substantially the same as those used in prior years, except that in 2018 F.N.B. Corp. and Signature Bank were removed from the peer group because their asset size significantly exceeded that of the peer group, and Lakeland Bancorp, OceanFirst Financial and Sterling Bancorp were added to the peer group as those companies are more comparable to Provident in asset size, competitive market and business mix. The current members of the peer group are as follows:
The Compensation Committee evaluates the peer groups annually for suitability and may modify peer groups from time to time based on mergers and acquisitions within the industry or other relevant factors. While our executive compensation program targets each named executive officer's base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term equity compensation at median levels, actual compensation paid to a named executive officer may vary based on other factors, such as the individual's performance, experience and competitive market conditions.
Role of Management
Although the Compensation Committee is ultimately responsible for designing our executive compensation program, input from our Chief Executive Officer is critical in ensuring that the Compensation Committee has the appropriate information needed to make informed decisions. The Chief Executive Officer participates in compensation-related actions associated with the other named executive officers purely in an informational and advisory capacity. He presents the other named executive officers' performance summaries and recommendations relating to their compensation to the Compensation Committee for its review and approval. The Chief Executive Officer neither recommends nor participates in Compensation Committee deliberations regarding his own compensation.
Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation
We pay our named executive officers in accordance with a pay for performance philosophy by providing competitive compensation for demonstrated performance. The Compensation Committee employs a total compensation approach in establishing executive compensation opportunities, consisting of base salary, annual cash incentive compensation, long-term equity awards (which may include performance- and/or time-vesting restricted stock and/or stock options), a competitive benefits package and limited perquisites.
As illustrated below in 2018, 64% of the target compensation (base salary, cash incentives and long-term equity) for Mr. Martin, and 52% of the target compensation to our other named executive officers, was performance-based and not guaranteed.
Base Salary
A competitive base salary is necessary to attract and retain talented executives. Each year, our Compensation Committee evaluates each named executive officer's base salary level. In general, competitive base salary information and peer market data are furnished to the Compensation Committee by the independent compensation consultant, and each named executive officer's base salary level is compared to the peer market data at the median. In setting base salary levels the Compensation Committee also assesses each individual named executive officer's performance, leadership, operational effectiveness and experience in the industry, as well as competitive market conditions.
In establishing base salaries for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered our company's financial performance as well as the peer group and market compensation analysis performed in 2017 by FW Cook. Based on that information, the Compensation Committee determined that the base salary increases for Mr. Martin and the other named executive officers reflected below were appropriate because of strong financial performance in 2017, our relative positioning to peers and broad merit increase budgets. Mr. Kuntz and Ms. Murray received larger base salary increases to account for larger competitive deficits to the median base salary of the peer group for comparable roles.
Annual Cash Incentive Payment/Executive Annual Incentive Plan for 2018
Annual cash incentive opportunities are provided to our named executive officers in order to align the attainment of annual corporate financial performance objectives with executive compensation. At the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee assigns corporate financial goals and a range of annual cash incentive award opportunities to each named executive officer. The award opportunities are linked to a specific target and range of performance results for multiple corporate financial performance measures and are calculated as a percentage of the named executive officer's base salary.
Our Compensation Committee established the performance goals for 2018 under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, which provided the opportunity for a cash incentive payment based upon the achievement of corporate goals. The targeted levels of incentive opportunity for 2018 were as follows:
For Mr. Martin and the other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee established the following 2018 goals (collectively, the "Corporate Goals") and relative weightings for the Executive Annual Incentive Cash Plan:
Under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, cash incentive payments based on Provident's actual 2018 financial performance would be made if financial performance met or exceeded 90% of any one of the Corporate Goals ("Threshold"). The payout curve under the annual incentive plan provides a 50% of Target payout for each metric at Threshold performance achievement and 150% of Target for each metric at Maximum performance achievement.
The overall actual achievement of Corporate Goals for 2018 was above Threshold and slightly below Target for all three performance goals which are measured on a GAAP basis (Earnings Per Share, Net Income, and Expense Ratio). The Executive Annual Incentive Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to adjust performance goals for extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items. There were no adjustments to the performance goals made by the Compensation Committee in 2018. Based upon the foregoing, and giving effect to the relative weightings of the performance goals, the Compensation Committee authorized payouts below the Target level under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan to the named executive officers as noted in the following table.
Long-Term Equity Incentives
Our Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan provides the opportunity to grant various forms of equity incentives on a performance-vesting and time-vesting basis. The Compensation Committee believes that stock ownership by our officers and employees provides a significant incentive in building long-term stockholder value by further aligning the interests of officers and employees with stockholders. This component of compensation increases in importance as Provident's common stock appreciates in value and serves as a retention tool for executives. The inclusion of performance-vesting awards also encourages a long-term strategic focus.
It is the policy of the Compensation Committee to make equity grants when the window for trading by directors and officers in Provident common stock is open under Provident's stock trading policy. Throughout the year, equity awards may be granted to new hires and promoted employees, or to existing employees to recognize superior performance with a grant date effective as of the date of the next regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting that falls when the window for trading is open under our stock trading policy.
The Compensation Committee established the equity component of total compensation as a percentage of base salary for Mr. Martin and other named executive officers, based upon competitive total compensation data previously provided by the independent compensation consultant. To maintain competitive total compensation and to further align executive pay with long-term financial performance, the Compensation Committee generally follows the guidelines below with respect to annual performance-vesting and time-vesting equity grants:
The composition of the 2018 long-term equity awards was as follows:
The Compensation Committee determined that for equity grants made in 2018 to all named executive officers including Mr. Martin, 75% of the value of the grants would be subject to performance-vesting, and 25% of the value would be time-vesting over three years. The time-vesting component of Mr. Martin's equity grant was in the form of stock options which the Compensation Committee viewed as performance-based because value is only realized if there is stock price appreciation over the term of the options.
Performance-vesting grants are measured at the end of a three-year period based upon performance goals established by the Compensation Committee at the time of the equity grant. Currently the performance goals include projections of a multi-year core return on average assets and return on average tangible equity. The core return on average assets measure may exclude unanticipated and non-recurring items of revenue or expense as determined by the Compensation Committee.
The return on average tangible equity portion of the award is subject to a relative total shareholder return ("TSR") modifier measured against the SNL Small Cap US Banks & Thrifts Index Peer Group. The modifier provides for (i) a downward 20% adjustment of payout if our TSR is below the 25th percentile and (ii) an upward 20% adjustment of payout if our TSR is at or above the 75th percentile. Between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, the modifier has no impact on payout.
This performance framework is designed to encourage conduct that drives long-term strategic decisions suited to maximizing stockholder value, while maintaining a meaningful impact on total compensation from our three-year relative total shareholder return and maintaining an appropriate level of at-risk compensation for retention purposes.
The Compensation Committee has determined that the performance goals for long-term equity awards are appropriately set such that participants will attain: (i) the Threshold level of performance if minimum expected levels of performance are achieved, which the Committee believed were reasonably likely to be attained; (ii) the Target level of performance if projected business plan expectations are achieved, which the Committee believed had approximately an even likelihood of either being attained or not being attained; and (iii) the Maximum level of performance, which sets a cap on how much incentive compensation will be paid in the event the Target level is meaningfully exceeded, which the Compensation Committee believes is difficult to achieve.
No dividends are paid with respect to any stock award subject to performance-vesting conditions unless and until the performance conditions are met and vesting occurs, and only on that portion of the stock award that actually vests.
Benefits
We offer the named executive officers benefits that are generally available to all employees, including medical and dental, disability insurance, group life insurance coverage, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") and a 401(k) Plan with discretionary employer matching contributions. Certain of the named executive officers have accrued benefits under a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was frozen as of April 1, 2003 following the adoption of the ESOP. In addition to pension benefits, medical and life insurance benefits are made available to certain employees when they retire. Although these post-retirement benefits have been eliminated, certain employees with ten or more years of service at the time the benefits were eliminated, including Mr. Martin, still qualify for these post-retirement benefits upon retirement. The named executive officers are also eligible for nonqualified benefits under the Non-Qualified Supplemental Defined Contribution Plan designed to make up for the IRS limits on contributions to the tax-qualified 401(k) Plan and ESOP.
Perquisites
The Compensation Committee believes that perquisites should be provided on a limited basis. The following perquisites are currently provided: a club membership for Mr. Martin and the use of a company-owned automobile for Messrs. Martin and Blum. Messrs. Lyons and Kuntz and Ms. Murray are paid a monthly car allowance. All of the named executive officers are eligible for an annual medical examination at Provident's expense. These limited perquisites are provided to maintain a competitive compensation package.
Elements of Post-Termination Benefits
Employment Agreement
Mr. Martin has an employment agreement with a twelve month term that renews on August 31 of each year for an additional twelve months. The employment agreement provides that if Mr. Martin's employment is terminated for reasons other than for cause, Mr. Martin would be entitled to:
Mr. Martin may resign from employment for good reason and receive these termination benefits in the event of certain adverse changes in his employment conditions. Under the employment agreement, the termination benefits are subject to Mr. Martin's compliance with non-solicit and non-compete provisions for a period of six months following his termination. The employment agreement does not provide for benefits for a termination following Mr. Martin's death, retirement or disability or following a change in control. Benefits relating to a termination following a change in control are provided for in a separate change in control agreement between Provident and Mr. Martin described in the following section "Change in Control Agreements".
Change in Control Agreements
Change in control agreements are reserved for a limited number of executives. Benefits are payable under the change in control agreements after the executive's qualifying termination event as described below following a change in control of Provident. We have entered into a three-year change in control agreement with Messrs. Martin, Blum, Kuntz, and Lyons and a two-year change in control agreement with Ms. Murray. Each of the agreements renews on the anniversary date of its respective effective date so that the remaining term is three years (or two years in the case of Ms. Murray) unless otherwise terminated.
Under the agreements:
Following a change in control and during the term of the agreement, the executive is entitled to a severance payment if:
Good reason is generally defined to include:
The change in control severance payment is equal to three times (and in the case of Ms. Murray two times) the highest level of aggregate annualized base salary and other cash compensation paid to the executive during the calendar year termination occurs, or during either of the immediately preceding two calendar years, whichever is greater. In addition, the executive is generally entitled to receive life, health, dental and disability coverage for the remaining term of the agreement. The gross benefits under the change in control agreements for the named executive officers, other than Mr. Martin, are reduced to avoid an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code if doing so results in a greater after-tax benefit to the executive.
The Compensation Committee considers these severance and change in control benefits to be an important part of the executive compensation program and consistent with market practice. The Compensation Committee believes that providing appropriate severance benefits helps attract and retain highly-qualified executives by mitigating the risks associated with leaving a previous employer and accepting a new position with Provident, and by providing income continuity following an unexpected termination.
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our Compensation Committee recommended, and our board of directors adopted, stock ownership levels for senior executives expressed as an amount of Provident common stock having a value equal to a multiple of base salary as follows:
Each of the named executive officers currently exceeds these guidelines. An executive's vested restricted stock awards, unvested time-vesting restricted stock awards, and shares of Provident common stock held in the ESOP and 401(k) Plan count toward compliance with the ownership guidelines.
Prohibition on Hedging
Our stock trading policy prohibits the named executive officers and others from engaging in any transaction designed to hedge or offset the economic risk of owning shares of our common stock. In addition, the policy provides that they should avoid pledging their shares of our common stock as collateral for a margin account or loan.
Clawback Policy
Our cash and equity incentive awards are subject to clawback provisions contained in our Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan Document. The clawback provisions provide that if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, whether or not as a result of misconduct, any executive officer who received incentive-based compensation based on erroneous data during the three-year period preceding the date of the accounting restatement, is required to reimburse the Company for compensation paid in excess of what would have been paid based on the data reported in the accounting restatement.
The cash and equity incentive awards granted to an employee are also subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Such events include termination of employment for cause, violation of material Company policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply, or other conduct that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company.
Risk Assessment
The Compensation Committee believes that any risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Provident. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the mix and design of the elements of our executive compensation program do not encourage management to assume excessive risks. The Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan Document serves as a core governance document for our cash and equity incentive compensation plans, establishing lines of authority, a foundation for relevant internal controls and procedures, and risk mitigation and accountability features, including clawbacks and deferrals.
The Compensation Committee assesses risks posed by the compensation plans maintained for the benefit of, and incentive compensation paid to, officers and employees. This comprehensive risk assessment is performed by our Chief Risk Officer, General Auditor and Chief Compliance Officer and is presented to and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The risk assessment includes an evaluation of:
The risk assessment conducted in 2018 concluded that our incentive compensation plans provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward, are compatible with effective controls and risk management, and are supportive of strong governance, including active oversight by the board of directors.
Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation
Under 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") on December 22, 2017, publicly-held corporations are subject to limits on the deductibility of executive compensation. Deductible compensation is limited to $1 million per year for each covered employee, defined as the publicly-held corporation's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and three additional highest compensated officers during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 2016. The Tax Act provides "grandfathered" treatment for certain compensation in excess of the $1 million deductibility limitation, including compensation that is "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) prior to the Tax Act, if payable pursuant to a written binding contract in effect as of November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect thereafter.
Our stock option grants and other performance-vesting equity grants awarded prior to November 2, 2017 are expected to continue to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation that is exempt from the deductibility limitation under Section 162(m). A number of requirements must be met for particular compensation to qualify for tax deductibility, so there can be no assurance that the incentive compensation awarded will be fully deductible in all circumstances.
The Compensation Committee has historically attempted to structure its compensation arrangements to achieve deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the benefit of such deductibility is considered by the Compensation Committee to be outweighed by the need for flexibility or the attainment of other objectives. As was the case prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Compensation Committee will continue to monitor issues concerning the deductibility of executive compensation. Since compensation objectives may not always be consistent with the requirements for tax deductibility, the Compensation Committee is prepared, when it deems appropriate, to enter into compensation arrangements under which payments will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, deductibility will be one of many factors considered by the Compensation Committee in ascertaining appropriate levels or modes of compensation.

OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018
Option Exercises and Stock Vested
The following table shows certain information about restricted stock awards that vested and stock options that were exercised in 2018.
Pension Benefits
We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen. All participants in the pension plan are 100% vested.
Pension plan participants generally become entitled to retirement benefits upon their later attainment of age 65 or the fifth anniversary of participation in the plan, which is referred to as the normal retirement date. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 1.35% of the participant's average final compensation up to the average social security level, plus 2% of the participant's average final compensation in excess of the average social security level multiplied by the participant's years of credited service to a maximum of 30 years.
Vested retirement benefits generally are paid beginning on the participant's normal retirement date. Participants with accrued benefits in the pension plan prior to April 1, 2003 continued to vest in their pre-April 1, 2003 accrued benefit.
A participant may elect to retire prior to age 65 and receive early retirement benefits if retirement occurs after completion of at least five consecutive years of vested service and attainment of age 55. If an early retirement election is made by a participant, retirement benefits will begin on the first day of any month during the ten-year period preceding the participant's normal retirement date, as directed by the retiring participant. If a participant elects to retire prior to attaining age 65 and after completing five years of credited service, his or her accrued pension benefit will be a reduced benefit calculated pursuant to the terms of the pension plan. However, if a participant elects to retire early after both attaining age 60 and completing 25 years of credited service, his or her accrued pension benefit will be unreduced. If the termination of service occurs after the normal retirement date, the participant's benefits will begin on the participant's postponed retirement date.
The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to each of our named executive officers, including the number of years of service credited to each named executive officer, under each of the pension plans determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in Provident's financial statements.
PENSION BENEFITS AT AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
The following table shows certain information about the participation by each named executive officer in our non-qualified defined contribution plans at and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION AT AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
We maintain a Non-Qualified Supplemental Defined Contribution Plan (the "Supplemental Plan"), which is a non-qualified plan that provides additional benefits to certain employees whose benefits under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP are reduced by tax law limitations applicable to tax-qualified plans. The Supplemental Plan requires a contribution for each participant who also participates in the 401(k) Plan and ESOP equal to the amount that would have been contributed under the terms of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP but for the tax law limitations, less the amount actually contributed under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP. The Supplemental Plan provides for a phantom stock allocation for qualified contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified ESOP and for matching contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified 401(k) Plan due to tax law limitations. Vesting of these supplemental benefits is subject to the same terms and conditions as the benefits provided under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP. The 401(k) portion of the benefit under the Supplemental Plan is credited with interest at an annual rate equal to the bond equivalent yield on United States Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of ten years. The ESOP portion of the benefit under the Supplemental Plan is credited with dividends payable on Provident common stock.
Benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan are payable to the participant in a lump sum during the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the earliest to occur of: (i) separation from service; (ii) disability; or (iii) death of the participant. The 401(k) portion of the benefit under the Supplemental Plan is paid in cash and the ESOP portion of the benefit is paid in cash unless the committee administering the Supplemental Plan determines in its sole discretion to pay the equivalent benefit in the form of Provident common stock.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Provident has entered into an employment agreement and a three-year change in control agreement with Mr. Martin, and three-year change in control agreements with Messrs. Lyons, Blum and Kuntz, and a two-year change in control agreement with Ms. Murray.
The following tables reflect the amount of compensation and benefits payable to each of the named executive officers at December 31, 2018 pursuant to such individual's employment agreement or change in control agreement, as applicable, in the event of termination of such executive's employment under the circumstances noted in the tables. No payments are required due to a voluntary termination under the employment agreement and the change in control agreements.
The amount of compensation and benefits payable to each named executive officer upon an involuntary termination without cause or a termination by the executive for Good Reason, in each case following a change in control and in the event of disability (with respect to Mr. Martin's employment agreement) is shown in the following tables. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, and thus include amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to the executive upon his or her termination. The amounts shown relating to unvested options and stock awards are based on the fair market value of our common stock on December 31, 2018 of $24.13 per share. The actual amounts that may be paid out to each executive can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from Provident. The amounts shown in the following tables do not take into account any reductions that may be required in order to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 280G best net benefit provisions in each of the named executive officers' agreements. There is no such best net benefit provision in Mr. Martin's agreement.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018
Pay Ratio Disclosure
The following is a reasonable estimate calculation, prepared in accordance with SEC rules, of the ratio of the total annual compensation paid to Mr. Martin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, to the median of the total annual compensation of all of our employees, except Mr. Martin for 2018.
Our median employee for this calculation was determined using total annual compensation data for all of our active employees, excluding Mr. Martin as of December 31, 2018. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis, and we did not annualize or prorate the data used in the calculation. Total annual compensation used to arrive at the median employee was consistent with that used to calculate total annual compensation for the named executive officers as required by the SEC, excluding the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings and the value of other benefits available on a non-discriminatory basis to all of our employees, such as company contributions to health, life and disability insurance.
After identifying the median employee as described above, we determined that the median employee had a total annual compensation of $58,024 for 2018, which was determined using the same methodology as required by the SEC for named executive officers as set forth in the summary compensation table. The total annual compensation for Mr. Martin for the same period shown in the summary compensation table presented earlier was $2,194,752. The ratio of Mr. Martin's total annual compensation to the median total annual compensation of all other employees for 2018 was 38:1.
Director Compensation
Elements of Director Compensation
Director Fees
As discussed under this caption, director compensation is paid to our non-management directors only. Mr. Martin receives no director compensation for his service on the board of directors.
Our board of directors establishes director compensation based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. Periodically, the Compensation Committee will engage the services of a third party and will consult external surveys to assist it in a review of director compensation.
We pay annual director fees based on a fiscal year covering the period starting May 1 and ending on April 30. We do not pay "per meeting" fees. The current director fee schedule is as follows:
Director Benefits
An annual medical examination is made available to each director under an arrangement with a designated service provider.
Retirement Plan for the Board of Directors of Provident Bank
The Retirement Plan for the Board of Directors of Provident Bank was terminated in 2005 to eliminate the accrual of benefits for directors with less than ten years of service as of December 31, 2006. For directors having ten or more years of service as of December 31, 2006 (includes two current directors), the plan provides cash payments for up to ten years based on age and length of service requirements. The maximum payment under this plan to a board member who terminates service on or after the normal retirement age as defined in the plan with at least ten years of service on the board is 40 quarterly payments of $1,250. We may suspend payments under this plan if Provident Bank fails to meet Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance minimum capital requirements. The plan further provides that, in the event of a change in control (as defined in the plan), the undistributed balance of a director's accrued benefit will be distributed to him within 60 days of such change in control.
Voluntary Fee Deferral Plans
Our directors may elect to defer the receipt of all or a portion of the cash compensation paid to them for service on the board of directors. Elections to defer fees and the scheduled distribution of amounts deferred and earnings on those amounts shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Deferred fees are credited to a memorandum account established for the benefit of each participant, and credited amounts currently earn interest at the prevailing prime rate.
In connection with its acquisition of First Sentinel Bancorp, Inc., Provident assumed the First Savings Bank Directors' Deferred Fee Plan, which was frozen prior to the completion of the acquisition. This plan will be paid out in accordance with the provisions of its governing documents.
The following table sets forth for the year ended December 31, 2018 certain information as to total remuneration paid to directors who served on the board of directors in 2018 other than Mr. Martin, who is not paid director fees. Compensation paid to Mr. Martin is included in this Proxy Statement under the heading "Executive Compensation--Summary Compensation Table."
Director Compensation Table
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis appearing earlier in this Proxy Statement describes our executive compensation program and the compensation decisions made by our Compensation Committee with respect to the Chief Executive Officer and other officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (who are referred to as the "named executive officers"). At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our board of directors recommended, and the stockholders approved, a non-binding vote in favor of holding an annual advisory vote on executive compensation. As a result, we determined to hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation until the next required stockholder vote relating to the frequency of stockholder voting on executive compensation. Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the board of directors is requesting stockholders to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Provident Financial Services, Inc. ("Provident") approve the compensation paid to Provident's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative accompanying the tables."
Our executive compensation program is based on a pay for performance philosophy that is designed to support our business strategy and align the interests of our executives with our stockholders. Our board of directors believes that the link between compensation and the achievement of its long- and short-term business goals has helped our company's financial performance over time, while not encouraging excessive risk-taking by management.
For these reasons, the board of directors is recommending that stockholders vote "FOR" this proposal. While this advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the board of directors value the views of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of this vote in future executive compensation decisions.
Our board of directors has adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the Provident Financial Services, Inc. 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2019 Equity Plan"). The purpose of the 2019 Equity Plan is to provide additional incentives for our officers, employees, directors and other service providers to promote our growth and performance and to further align their interests with those of our stockholders. If the 2019 Equity Plan is approved by stockholders, no more awards will be granted under the Provident Financial Services, Inc. Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Prior Plan"), which is the only existing equity plan of the company.
Governance Highlights of the 2019 Equity Plan
The 2019 Equity Plan incorporates certain governance best practices, including:
Summary of the 2019 Equity Plan
The following is a summary of the material features of the 2019 Equity Plan, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the 2019 Equity Plan, attached hereto as Appendix A.
Administration
The 2019 Equity Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee, members of which are "disinterested board members," as defined in the 2019 Equity Plan. The Compensation Committee has power within the limitations set forth in the 2019 Equity Plan to make all decisions and determinations regarding the selection of participants and the granting of awards; establishing the terms and conditions relating to each award; adopting rules, regulations and guidelines for carrying out the Plan's purposes; and interpreting and otherwise construing the 2019 Equity Plan.
The Compensation Committee also has the authority to reduce, eliminate or accelerate any restrictions or vesting requirements applicable to an award at any time after the grant of the award.
Approval of the 2019 Equity Plan by the stockholders authorizes the Compensation Committee to determine the number of awards to be granted to non-employee directors, subject to the individual limitations in the 2019 Equity Plan as set forth therein and discussed further below.
Eligibility
Employees and directors of, or service providers to, the company or its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Equity Plan, except that non-employees may not be granted incentive stock options. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to determine the employees, directors and service providers who will be granted an award under the 2019 Equity Plan.
Number of Shares Authorized
The 2019 Equity Plan authorizes the issuance to participants of up to (A) 1,350,000 shares of the company's common stock, plus (B) the number of shares of our common stock that remain available for awards under the Prior Plan on the day the 2019 Equity Plan is approved by our stockholders (such sum of (A) plus (B) the "Share Limit") pursuant to grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, including incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, any of which may vest based either on the passage of time or achievement of performance, or a combination of each.
If any award granted under the 2019 Equity Plan or under the Prior Plan expires, terminates, is canceled or is forfeited without being settled or exercised or is settled without the issuance of shares of common stock, shares of the company's common stock subject to such award will be made available for future grant under the 2019 Equity Plan. In addition, if shares issuable upon the vesting or settlement of an award are withheld by the company, or if shares owned by a participant are surrendered or tendered to the company, in payment of taxes required or permitted to be withheld in respect of the award (other than an award of stock options), such shares will be made available for future grants under the 2019 Equity Plan. If any shares are surrendered or tendered to pay the exercise price of, or satisfy the withholding taxes owed with respect to, a stock option, such shares will not again be available for grant under the 2019 Equity Plan.
As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,457,429 shares of company common stock available under the Prior Plan, which would result in a Share Limit of 2,807,429 shares of company common stock if the 2019 Equity Plan was approved by the stockholders on such date. The actual Share Limit will reflect incremental changes in the number of shares remaining available under the Prior Plan to reflect issuances and forfeitures of awards following such date through the actual date that stockholders approve the 2019 Equity Plan. The following table includes more specific information regarding outstanding equity awards issued under our Prior Plan as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and shares available for future awards under the Prior Plan as of December 31, 2018.
The following table sets forth information regarding the share usage for each of the last three fiscal years for all Awards reported in our Form 10-Ks for those periods. The share usage has been calculated as the quotient of (i) the sum of (x) all stock options granted in such year and (y), all time-vesting and performance-vesting stock awards granted in such year, divided by (ii) the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during such year.
Limitations
The 2019 Equity Plan includes the following limitations:
Adjustments
In the event of a corporate transaction involving the stock of the company, such as a recapitalization, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend or a stock split, the number of shares covered by awards then outstanding under the 2019 Equity Plan, the limitation on awards under the 2019 Equity Plan and/or the exercise price of outstanding stock options and other equitable substitutions or adjustments will be made proportionally and uniformly to reflect such corporate transaction, as applicable.
Types of Awards
The Compensation Committee may determine the type and terms and conditions of awards under the 2019 Equity Plan, which will be set forth in an award agreement delivered to each participant. Each award will be subject to the conditions established by the Compensation Committee as set forth in the recipient's award agreement and will be subject to vesting conditions and restrictions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Awards may be granted as incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards or restricted stock units any of which may vest based either on the passage of time or achievement of performance, as follows:
Stock Options. A stock option is the right to purchase shares of common stock at a specified price for a specified period of time.
Restricted Stock. A restricted stock award is a grant of shares of company common stock to a participant for no consideration (or such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law) that is subject to certain restrictions as may be determined by the Compensation Committee for a specified period.
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units may be denominated in shares of common stock and are similar to restricted stock awards except that no shares of common stock are actually issued to the award recipient at the time of grant of a restricted stock unit. Rather, the restricted stock units are settled, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, when the units are earned or at a later date.
Performance Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant any award under the 2019 Equity Plan in the form of a performance award by conditioning the vesting of the award on the satisfaction of certain performance goals of the company and/or the participant.
Performance Measures
The performance measures can include, but are not limited to: book value or tangible book value per share; basic earnings per share (e.g., earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; or earnings per share); basic cash earnings per share; diluted earnings per share; return on equity; return on average tangible equity; net income or net income before taxes; net interest income; non-interest income; non-interest expense to average assets ratio; cash general and administrative expense to average assets ratio; efficiency ratio; cash efficiency ratio; financial return ratios; core earnings, capital ratios; increase in revenue; total stockholder return; net operating income, operating income; net interest margin or net interest rate spread; stock price; assets, growth in assets, loans or deposits, asset quality level, charge offs, loan reserves, non-performing assets, loans, deposits, growth of loans, loan production volume, non-performing loans, deposits or assets; regulatory compliance or safety and soundness; achievement of balance sheet or income statement objectives and strategic business objectives, or any combination of these or other measures.
Performance measures may be based on the performance of the company as a whole or on any one or more subsidiaries or business units of the company or a subsidiary and may be measured relative to a peer group, an index or a business plan and may be considered as absolute measures or changes in measures. The terms of an award may provide that partial achievement of performance measures may result in partial payment or vesting of the award or that the achievement of the performance measures may be measured over more than one period or fiscal year. In establishing any performance measures, the Compensation Committee may provide for the exclusion of the effects of one or more items, including but not limited to: (i) extraordinary, unusual, and/or nonrecurring items of gain or loss; (ii) gains or losses on the disposition of a business; (iii) dividends declared on the company's stock; (iv) changes in tax or accounting principles, regulations or laws; or (v) expenses incurred in connection with a merger, branch acquisition or similar transaction.
Vesting of Awards
The Compensation Committee shall specify the vesting schedule or conditions of each award.
Change in Control
The 2019 Equity Plan uses a double trigger change in control feature, providing for an acceleration of vesting upon an involuntary termination of employment or service simultaneous with or following a change in control.
Awards Subject to Clawback Policy
Awards granted under the 2019 Equity Plan are subject to clawback if the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the company, as a result of misconduct with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws and the forfeiture provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 apply. Awards are also subject to clawback provisions contained in our Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan Document, as described in this Proxy Statement in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the heading "Clawback Policy".
Amendment and Termination
Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2019 Equity Plan or any award granted under the 2019 Equity Plan. However, except as provided in the 2019 Equity Plan, no amendment or termination may adversely impair the rights of an outstanding award without the participant's (or affected beneficiary's) written consent. The board of directors may not amend the 2019 Equity Plan to allow repricing of a stock option, materially increase the aggregate number of securities that may be issued under the Plan (other than as provided in the 2019 Equity Plan), materially increase the benefits accruing to a participant, or materially modify the requirements for participation in the 2019 Equity Plan, without approval of stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board may, without stockholder approval, amend the 2019 Equity Plan at any time, retroactively or otherwise, to ensure that the Plan complies with current or future law and our board of directors may unilaterally amend the 2019 Equity Plan and any outstanding award, without participant consent, in order to conform to any changes in the law or any accounting pronouncement or interpretation thereof.
Duration of Plan
The 2019 Equity Plan will have a term of ten years following the date on which it is approved by the stockholders, and no awards may be granted after that date.
Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following is a summary of the federal income tax consequences that may arise in conjunction with participation in the 2019 Equity Plan.
Non-Qualified Stock Options. The grant of a non-qualified stock option will not result in taxable income to the participant. Except as described below, the participant will realize ordinary income at the time of exercise in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the exercise price for those shares, and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes, provided, however, that such deduction may be limited under Sections 162(m) and 280G of the Code. Gains or losses realized by the participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.
Incentive Stock Options. The grant of an incentive stock option will not result in taxable income to the participant. The exercise of an incentive stock option will not result in taxable income to the participant provided the participant was, without a break in service, an employee of the company or a subsidiary during the period beginning on the date of the grant of the option and ending on the date three months prior to the date of exercise (one year prior to the date of exercise if the participant is disabled, as that term is defined in the Code). We will not be entitled to a tax deduction upon the exercise of an incentive stock option.
The excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the exercise of an incentive stock option over the exercise price is an adjustment that is included in the calculation of the participant's alternative minimum taxable income for the tax year in which the incentive stock option is exercised. For purposes of determining the participant's alternative minimum tax liability for the year of disposition of the shares acquired pursuant to the incentive stock option exercise, the participant will have a basis in those shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.
If the participant does not sell or otherwise dispose of the shares within two years from the date of the grant of the incentive stock option or within one year after the exercise of such stock option, then, upon disposition of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed as a capital gain. A capital loss will be recognized to the extent that the amount realized is less than the exercise price. If the foregoing holding period requirements are not met, the participant will generally recognize ordinary income at the time of the disposition of the shares in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price, or (ii) the excess, if any, of the amount realized upon disposition of the shares over the exercise price, and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. If the amount realized exceeds the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, any additional amount will be a capital gain. If the amount realized at the time of disposition is less than the exercise price, the participant will recognize no income, and a capital loss will be recognized equal to the excess of the exercise price over the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares.
Restricted Stock. A participant who has been granted a restricted stock award will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, provided that the stock subject to the award is not delivered at the time of grant, or if the stock is delivered, it is subject to restrictions that constitute a "substantial risk of forfeiture" for federal income tax purposes. Upon the later of delivery or vesting of shares subject to an award, the holder will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the then fair market value of those shares and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. Gains or losses realized by the participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of delivery or vesting. Dividends paid to the holder will also be compensation income to the participant and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes, provided, however, that such deduction may be limited under Sections 162(m) and 280G of the Code. A participant who makes an election under Code Section 83(b) will include the full fair market value of the restricted stock award (or portion of the award subject to such election) in taxable income in the year of grant at the grant date fair market value. The Compensation Committee has the right to prohibit participants from making Code Section 83(b) elections.
Restricted Stock Units. A participant who has been granted a restricted stock unit will not realize taxable income at the time of grant and will not be entitled to make an election under Code Section 83(b) since no stock is actually transferred to the recipient on the date of grant. At the time a restricted stock unit vests, assuming the award is distributed at that time, the recipient will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common stock or the amount of cash received. If the restricted stock unit is not distributed at the time it vests, no income will be recognized at that time and taxation will be deferred until the value of the restricted stock unit is distributed. At the time the recipient recognizes taxable income on a restricted stock unit, we will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the same amount recognized by the award recipient provided, however, that such deduction may be limited under Sections 162(m) and 280G of the Code.
Withholding of Taxes. We may withhold amounts from participants to satisfy withholding tax requirements. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, participants may have shares withheld from awards to satisfy tax withholding requirements up to an amount that will not trigger adverse accounting for the company.
Change in Control. Any acceleration of the vesting or payment of awards under the 2019 Equity Plan in the event of a change in control or termination of service that is contingent upon a change in control may cause part or all of the consideration involved to be treated as an "excess parachute payment" under the Section 280G of the Code, which may subject the participant to a 20% excise tax and preclude deduction by the company.
Deduction Limits. Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits our ability to deduct for tax purposes compensation in excess of $1.0 million per year for each of our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and three other executive officers named in the summary compensation table (each, a "covered employee") of our annual proxy statement, as well as any employee who has been designated a covered employee for any fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2016. Compensation resulting from awards under the 2019 Equity Plan will be counted toward the $1.0 million limit.
Tax Advice. The preceding discussion is based on federal tax laws and regulations presently in effect, which are subject to change, and the discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the federal income tax aspects of the 2019 Equity Plan. A participant may also be subject to state and local taxes in connection with the grant of awards under the 2019 Equity Plan.
Other Information
The number, types and terms of awards to be made pursuant to the 2019 Equity Plan are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and have not been determined at this time.
Required Vote and Recommendation of the Board of Directors
In order to approve the 2019 Equity Plan, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, either in person or by proxy.
Our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018 was KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee has re-appointed KPMG LLP to continue as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, subject to the ratification by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, and they will be given an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Stockholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise. However, our board of directors is submitting the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, our Audit Committee will reconsider whether it should select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change is in the best interests of Provident and its stockholders.
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed to Provident for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP for the audit of the annual financial statements, review of the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by KPMG LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings and engagements were $954,000 and $934,000 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Audit-Related Fees. The aggregate fees billed to Provident for assurance and related services rendered by KPMG LLP that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit and review of the financial statements and that are not already reported in "Audit Fees" above, were $140,450 and $123,900 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These services included audits of our employee benefit plans.
Tax Fees. No fees were billed to Provident for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as the Audit Committee currently has a policy that the independent registered public accounting firm shall not perform the preparation and filing of our corporate tax returns, tax compliance and other tax-related services.
All Other Fees. No fees were billed to Provident for other permissible services rendered by KPMG LLP during each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Pre-Approval Policy. Our Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee up to a maximum amount of $25,000 between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided the Chair reports any such approvals to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The full Audit Committee pre-approves all other services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related fees.
Submission of Stockholder Proposals
To be eligible for inclusion in our proxy materials for next year's Annual Meeting of stockholders, any stockholder proposal under SEC Rule 14a-8 to take action at such meeting must be received at our executive office at 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302, no later than November 15, 2019. Any such proposals shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Advance Notice of Business to be Conducted at an Annual Meeting
Our Bylaws provide an advance notice procedure for certain business or nominations to our board of directors to be brought before an Annual Meeting of stockholders. For a stockholder to properly bring business before an Annual Meeting, the stockholder must give written notice to our Corporate Secretary not less than 120 days prior to the date of Provident's proxy materials for the preceding year's Annual Meeting, or by no later than November 15, 2019 for next year's Annual Meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the date of the Annual Meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year's Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such Annual Meeting is first made. The notice must include the stockholder's name, record address, and number of shares owned; describe briefly the proposed business; the reasons for bringing the proposed business before the Annual Meeting; and any material interest of the stockholder in the proposed business. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to require Provident to include in its proxy materials under SEC Rule 14a-8 any stockholder proposal that does not meet all of the requirements for inclusion established by the SEC in effect at the time such proposal is received.
Other Matters
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, our board of directors knows of no matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than as described in this document. However, if any other matters shall properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and shall be voted upon, the proposed proxy will be deemed to confer authority to the individuals named therein to vote the shares represented by the proxy in accordance with their best judgment as to any such matters.

The purpose of this Provident Financial Services, Inc. 2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the "Plan") is to promote the long-term financial success of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the "Company"), and its Subsidiaries, including Provident Bank (the "Bank") by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company's stockholders through the ownership of Company common stock. The "Effective Date" of the Plan is ____________, 2019, which is the expected date of the approval of the Plan by the Company's stockholders. The Plan shall remain in effect as long as any awards under it are outstanding; provided, however, that no Awards may be granted under the Plan after the day immediately prior to the ten-year anniversary of the Effective Date. Upon stockholder approval of this Plan, no further awards shall be granted under the Prior Plan, and the Prior Plan shall remain in existence solely for the purpose of administering outstanding grants thereunder.
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee"), in accordance with Section 5.1.
Each Employee or Director of, or service provider to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who is granted an Award in accordance with the terms of the Plan shall be a "Participant" in the Plan. The grant of Awards under the Plan shall be limited to Employees and Directors of, and service providers to, the Company or any Subsidiary.
Capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in Article 8 and elsewhere in the Plan.
Any Award under the Plan may be granted singularly, or in combination with another Award (or Awards). Each Award under the Plan shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and such additional terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Committee shall provide with respect to such Award and as evidenced in the Award Agreement. Every Award under the Plan shall require a written Award Agreement. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.6, an Award may be granted as an alternative to or replacement (subject to Section 2.7) of an existing award under the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any Subsidiary (provided, however, that no reload Awards shall be granted hereunder) or as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plan or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including without limitation the plan of any entity acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary. The types of Awards that may be granted under the Plan include:
The Committee shall specify the vesting schedule or conditions of each Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, Awards granted under the Plan shall vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the Award is granted; provided, that the following Awards shall not be subject to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement: any (i) substitute Awards granted in connection with awards that are assumed, converted or substituted pursuant to a merger, acquisition or similar transaction entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) Awards to Non-Employee Directors that vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, and (iii) any additional Awards the Committee may grant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 3.2 (subject to adjustment under Section 3.4); and, provided, further, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the Committee's discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any Award or acceleration in the event of death, Disability or a Change in Control in the terms of the Award Agreement or otherwise.
If any Award would be considered "deferred compensation" as defined under Code Section 409A ("Deferred Compensation"), the Committee reserves the absolute right (including the right to delegate such right) to unilaterally amend the Plan or the Award Agreement, without the consent of the Participant, to maintain exemption from, or to comply with, Code Section 409A. Any amendment by the Committee to the Plan or an Award Agreement pursuant to this Section shall maintain, to the extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without violating Code Section 409A. A Participant's acceptance of any Award under the Plan constitutes acknowledgement and consent to such rights of the Committee, without further consideration or action. Any discretionary authority retained by the Committee pursuant to the terms of this Plan or pursuant to an Award Agreement shall not be applicable to an Award which is determined to constitute Deferred Compensation, if such discretionary authority would contravene Code Section 409A. Unless otherwise provided in a valid election form intended to comply with Code Section 409A, all Awards that are considered Deferred Compensation hereunder shall settle and be paid in no event later than 2 ½ months following the end of the calendar year with respect to which the Award's substantial risk of forfeiture lapsed.
Except for adjustments pursuant to Section 3.4 or in connection with a Change in Control, and reductions of the Exercise Price approved by the Company's stockholders, neither the Committee nor the Board shall have the right or authority to make any adjustment or amendment that reduces or would have the effect of reducing the Exercise Price of a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan, whether through amendment, cancellation (including cancellation in exchange for a cash payment in excess of the Stock Option's in-the-money value or in exchange for Stock Options or other Awards) or replacement grants, or other means.
The Committee shall establish the effect of a Termination of Service on the continuation of rights and benefits available under an Award and, in so doing, may make distinctions based upon, among other things, the cause of Termination of Service and type of Award. Unless otherwise specified by the Committee and set forth in an Award Agreement, the following provisions shall apply to each Award granted under this Plan:
The shares of Stock with respect to which Awards may be made under the Plan shall be shares currently authorized but unissued, currently held or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, subsequently acquired by the Company, including shares purchased in the open market or in private transactions.
Delivery of shares of Stock or other amounts under the Plan shall be subject to the following:
Subject to the provisions of Section 3.4 (relating to the adjustment of shares and cancellation of Stock Options in exchange for a cash or stock payment of the in-the-money value) and except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement:
For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred upon the earliest to occur of the following:
The Plan shall be administered by the members of the Compensation Committee of the Company who are Disinterested Board Members. If the Committee consists of fewer than two Disinterested Board Members, then the Board shall appoint to the Committee such additional Disinterested Board Members as shall be necessary to provide for a Committee consisting of at least two Disinterested Board Members. Any members of the Committee who do not qualify as Disinterested Board Members shall abstain from participating in any discussion or decision to make or administer Awards that are made to Participants who at the time of consideration for such Award are persons subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Board (or if necessary to maintain compliance with the applicable listing standards, those members of the Board who are "independent directors" under the corporate governance statutes or rules of any national Exchange on which the Company lists, or has listed or seeks to list its securities, may, in its discretion, take any action and exercise any power, privilege or discretion conferred on the Committee under the Plan with the same force and effect under the Plan as if done or exercised by the Committee.
The Committee's administration of the Plan shall be subject to the following:
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the applicable rules of an Exchange upon which the Company lists its shares or the Plan, or as necessary to comply with the exemptive provisions of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it, including (a) delegating to a committee of one or more members of the Board who are not "Disinterested Board Members," the authority to grant Awards under the Plan to eligible persons who are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act; or (b) delegating to a committee of one or more members of the Board who would be eligible to serve on the Compensation Committee of the Company pursuant to the listing requirements imposed by any national securities Exchange on which the Company lists, has listed or seeks to list its securities, the authority to grant awards under the Plan. The acts of such delegates shall be treated hereunder as acts of the Committee and such delegates shall report regularly to the Committee regarding the delegated duties and responsibilities and any awards so granted. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
As may be permitted by applicable law, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall furnish the Committee with such data and information as it determines may be required for it to discharge its duties. The records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as to a Participant's employment, termination of employment, leave of absence, reemployment and compensation shall be conclusive on all persons unless determined by the Committee to be manifestly incorrect. Subject to applicable law, Participants and other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the Plan.
The Committee shall hold such meetings, and may make such administrative rules and regulations, as it may deem proper. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the action of a majority of the members of the Committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, as well as actions taken pursuant to the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the Committee without holding a meeting, shall be deemed to be actions of the Committee. Subject to Section 5.1, all actions of the Committee shall be final and conclusive and shall be binding upon the Company, Participants and all other interested parties. Any person dealing with the Committee shall be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, instruction, direction or other communication signed by a member of the Committee or by a representative of the Committee authorized to sign the same in its behalf.
The Board may, as permitted by law, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, and may, at any time, amend any Award Agreement, provided that no amendment or termination (except as provided in Section 2.6, Section 3.4 and Section 6.2) may cause the Award to violate Code Section 409A, may cause the repricing of a Stock Option, or, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely impair the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board; provided, however, that, no amendment may (a) materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan; (b) materially increase the aggregate number of securities that may be issued under the Plan, other than pursuant to Section 3.4, or (c) materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan, unless the amendment under (a), (b) or (c) above is approved by the Company's stockholders.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may amend the Plan or any Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of (i) conforming the Plan or the Award Agreement to any present or future law relating to plans of this or similar nature (including, but not limited to, Code Section 409A), or (ii) avoiding an accounting treatment resulting from an accounting pronouncement or interpretation thereof issued by the SEC or Financial Accounting Standards Board subsequent to the adoption of the Plan or the making of the Award affected thereby, which in the sole discretion of the Committee, may materially and adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. By accepting an Award under this Plan, each Participant agrees and consents to any amendment made pursuant to this Section 6.2 or Section 2.6 to any Award granted under the Plan without further consideration or action.
Except as otherwise so provided by the Committee, ISOs under the Plan are not transferable except (i) as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; (ii) to a trust established by the Participant, if under Code Section 671 and applicable state law, the Participant is considered the sole beneficial owner of the Stock Option while held in trust, or (iii) between spouses incident to a divorce or pursuant to a domestic relations order, provided, however, in the case of a transfer within the meaning of this Section 7.2(iii), the Stock Option shall not qualify as an ISO as of the day of such transfer. The Committee shall have the discretion to permit the transfer of vested Stock Options (other than ISOs) under the Plan; provided, however, that such transfers shall be limited to Immediate Family Members of Participants, trusts and partnerships established for the primary benefit of such family members or to charitable organizations, and; provided, further, that such transfers are not made for consideration to the Participant.
Restricted Stock Awards shall not be transferable prior to the time that such Awards vest in the Participant. A Restricted Stock Unit Award is not transferable, except in the event of death, prior to the time that the Restricted Stock Unit Award vests and is earned and the property in which the Restricted Stock Unit is denominated is distributed to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary.
A Participant hereunder may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries under this Plan and may from time to time revoke or amend any such designation ("Beneficiary Designation"). Any designation of beneficiary under this Plan shall be controlling over any other disposition, testamentary or otherwise (unless such disposition is pursuant to a domestic relations order); provided, however, that if the Committee is in doubt as to the entitlement of any such beneficiary to any Award, the Committee may determine to recognize only the legal representative of the Participant in which case the Company, the Committee and the members thereof shall not be under any further liability to anyone.
Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units or Stock Options otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
Each Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. A copy of the Award Agreement, in any medium chosen by the Committee, shall be provided (or made available electronically) to the Participant, and the Committee may, but need not require, that the Participant sign a copy of the Award Agreement. In the absence of a specific provision in the Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control.
Unless otherwise specified herein, each election required or permitted to be made by any Participant or other person entitled to benefits under the Plan, and any permitted modification, or revocation thereof, shall be filed with the Company at such times, in such form, and subject to such restrictions and limitations, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall require. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Committee may, on the date of grant or at a later date, as applicable, prohibit an individual from making an election under Code Section 83(b). If the Committee has not prohibited an individual from making this election, an individual who makes this election shall notify the Committee of the election within ten (10) days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service. This requirement is in addition to any filing and notification required under the regulations issued under the authority of Code Section 83(b).
Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information upon which the person is acting considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties.
Where a Participant is entitled to receive shares of Stock upon the vesting or exercise of an Award, the Company shall have the right to require such Participant to pay to the Company the amount of any tax that the Company is required to withhold with respect to such vesting or exercise, or, in lieu thereof, to retain, or to sell without notice, a sufficient number of shares of Stock to cover the minimum amount required to be withheld. To the extent determined by the Committee or specified in an Award Agreement and no adverse accounting consequences are triggered under FASB ASC Topic 718 or its successor and is permitted under applicable withholding rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service or another applicable governmental entity, a Participant shall have the ability to direct the Company to satisfy up to his or her highest marginal tax rate of required federal, state and local tax withholding by, (i) with respect to a Stock Option, reducing the number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option (without issuance of such shares of Stock to the Stock Option holder) by a number equal to the quotient of (a) the total maximum amount of tax withholding divided by (b) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the exercise date over the Exercise Price per share of Stock; and (ii) with respect to Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units, withholding a number of shares (based on the Fair Market Value on the vesting date) otherwise vesting that would satisfy the maximum amount of tax withholding. Provided there are no adverse accounting consequences to the Company (a requirement to have liability classification of an award under FASB ASC Topic 718 is an adverse consequence), a Participant who is not required to have taxes withheld may require the Company to withhold in accordance with the preceding sentence as if the Award up to the Participant's highest marginal tax rate.
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be by resolution of its Board of Directors, or by action of one or more members of the Board (including a committee of the Board) who are duly authorized to act for the Board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of the Exchange on which the Company lists its securities) by a duly authorized officer of the Company or such Subsidiary.
All obligations of the Company under this Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business, stock, and/or assets of the Company.
To the fullest extent permitted by law and the Company's governing documents, each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 5.3, or an Employee of the Company shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company (i) against and from any loss (including amounts paid in settlement), cost, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan; and (ii) against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute or regulation. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's charter or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. The foregoing right to indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, if required by applicable law, an advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such persons to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses.
Unless otherwise permitted by the Committee, no fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated by rounding down.
The Plan, all awards granted hereunder, and all actions taken in connection herewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of laws, except as superseded by applicable federal law. The federal and state courts located in Hudson County, New Jersey shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim, action, complaint or lawsuit brought under the terms of the Plan. By accepting any award under this Plan, each Participant, and any other person claiming any rights under the Plan, agrees to submit himself or herself, and any legal action that the Participant brings under the Plan, to the sole jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication and resolution of any such disputes.
Except as otherwise provided by the Committee or as set forth in a Qualified Retirement Plan, Awards to a Participant (including the grant and the receipt of benefits) under the Plan shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the Participant's benefits under, or contributions to, any Qualified Retirement Plan, non-qualified plan and any other benefit plans maintained by the Participant's employer. The term "Qualified Retirement Plan" means any plan of the Company or a Subsidiary that is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a).
If any provision of this Plan is determined to be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision has never been included herein.
Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, all written notices and all other written communications to the Company provided for in the Plan, or in any Award Agreement, shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid (provided that international mail shall be sent via overnight or two-day delivery), or sent by facsimile, email or prepaid overnight courier to the Company at its principal executive office. Such notices, demands, claims and other communications shall be deemed given:
provided, however, that in no event shall any such communications be deemed to be given later than the date they are actually received, provided they are actually received. In the event a communication is not received, it shall only be deemed received upon the showing of an original of the applicable receipt, registration or confirmation from the applicable delivery service. Communications that are to be delivered by the U.S. mail or by overnight service to the Company shall be directed to the attention of the Company's Chief Operating Officer and to the Corporate Secretary, unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Award Agreement.
The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events include, but are not limited to, termination of employment for Cause, termination of the Participant's provision of Services to the Company or any Subsidiary, violation of material Company or Subsidiary policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct of the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or any Subsidiary.
In the sole discretion of the Committee exercised in accordance with Section 5.2(a) above, any Stock Options that are exercisable but unexercised as of the day immediately before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant may be automatically exercised, in accordance with procedures established for this purpose by the Committee, but only if the exercise price is less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on such date and the automatic exercise will result in the issuance of at least one (1) whole share of Stock to the Participant after payment of the exercise price and any applicable minimum tax withholding requirements. Payment of the exercise price and any applicable tax withholding requirements shall be made by a net settlement of the Stock Option whereby the number of shares of Stock to be issued upon exercise are reduced by a number of shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price and any applicable minimum tax withholding.
The grant and settlement of Awards under this Plan shall be conditioned upon and subject to compliance with Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(k), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
In addition to the other definitions contained herein, unless otherwise specifically provided in an Award Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:
Performance measures can include, but are not limited to: book value or tangible book value per share; basic earnings per share (e.g., earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; or earnings per share); basic cash earnings per share; diluted earnings per share; return on equity; return on average tangible equity; net income or net income before taxes; net interest income; non-interest income; non-interest expense to average assets ratio; cash general and administrative expense to average assets ratio; efficiency ratio; cash efficiency ratio; financial return ratios; core earnings, capital ratios; increase in revenue; total stockholder return; net operating income, operating income; net interest margin or net interest rate spread; stock price; assets, growth in assets, loans or deposits, asset quality level, charge offs, loan reserves, non-performing assets, loans, deposits, growth of loans, loan production volume, non-performing loans, deposits or assets; regulatory compliance or safety and soundness; achievement of balance sheet or income statement objectives and strategic business objectives, or any combination of these or other measures.
Performance measures may be based on the performance of the Company as a whole or on any one or more Subsidiaries or business units of the Company or a Subsidiary and may be measured relative to a peer group, an index or a business plan and may be considered as absolute measures or changes in measures. The terms of an Award may provide that partial achievement of performance measures may result in partial payment or vesting of the award or that the achievement of the performance measures may be measured over more than one period or fiscal year. In establishing any performance measures, the Committee may provide for the exclusion of the effects of one or more items, including but not limited to: (i) extraordinary, unusual, and/or nonrecurring items of gain or loss; (ii) gains or losses on the disposition of a business; (iii) dividends declared on the Company's stock; (iv) changes in tax or accounting principles, regulations or laws; or (v) expenses incurred in connection with a merger, branch acquisition or similar transaction. Subject to the preceding sentence, if the Committee determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the Company or the manner in which the Company or its Subsidiaries conducts its business or other events or circumstances render current performance measures to be unsuitable, the Committee may modify such performance measures, in whole or in part, as the Committee deems appropriate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, performance measures relating to any Award hereunder will be modified, to the extent applicable, to reflect a change in the outstanding shares of Stock of the Company by reason of any stock dividend or stock split, or a corporate transaction, such as a merger of the Company into another corporation, any separation of a corporation or any partial or complete liquidation by the Company or a Subsidiary. If a Participant is promoted, demoted or transferred to a different business unit during a performance period, the Committee may determine that the selected performance measures or applicable performance period are no longer appropriate, in which case, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may: (i) adjust, change or eliminate the performance measures or change the applicable performance period; or (ii) cause to be made a cash payment to the Participant in an amount determined by the Committee.
