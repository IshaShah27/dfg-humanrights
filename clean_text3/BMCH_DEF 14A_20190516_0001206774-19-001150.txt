Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting to be Held on May 16, 2019.
This Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report are available through our Investor Relations website at ir.buildwithbmc.com or at www.proxyvote.com.
What does this mean? We are providing access to our proxy materials primarily over the Internet. On March 29, 2019, we began mailing to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials (unless such stockholder had previously requested to receive a paper copy). The notice contains instructions on how to access those documents online and how to receive a paper copy. This process conserves natural resources and reduces our printing and distribution costs, while providing a timely and convenient method for stockholders to access our materials.

 At the Annual Meeting, three director nominees are to be elected as Class III directors. Upon recommendation by the Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Cory J. Boydston, Henry Buckley and Carl R. Vertuca, Jr. for election for a term of three years (through the 2022 Annual Meeting) and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. Each of the nominees currently serves as a Company director. Mrs. Boydston and Mr. Buckley were appointed to the Board in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and so have not previously been elected by BMC's stockholders. Mr. Vertuca was previously elected by BMC's stockholders in 2016. In connection with the September 2018 appointment of Mr. Flitman as President, Chief Executive Officer and a Class II director, the Board increased its size to ten and the number of Class II directors to three. Unless a proxy specifies otherwise, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered thereby FOR the nominees as listed. Each nominee has consented to be a candidate and to serve if elected. Although the Board has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unavailable to serve as a director, if such an event should occur, the Board may designate a substitute nominee or reduce the size of the Board. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, proxies will be voted for such substitute nominee(s).

BOARD COMPOSITION
The Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the succession planning process for directors and ensuring that we have the right people on the Board, both now and in the future, to oversee management's execution of the Company's strategy and safeguard the long-term interests of stockholders. In this regard, the Governance Committee is charged with identifying, screening and recruiting potential director candidates to fill expected vacancies.
HOW WE BUILD A BOARD THAT'S RIGHT FOR BMC
In identifying potential candidates for Board membership, the Governance Committee relies on suggestions and recommendations from directors, stockholders, management and others, including from time to time executive search firms to assist it in locating qualified candidates. The Governance Committee does not distinguish between nominees recommended by stockholders and other nominees.
Once potential director candidates are identified, the Governance Committee, with the assistance of management, undergoes an extensive vetting process that considers each candidate's background, independence and fit with the Board's priorities. As part of this vetting process, the committee as well as other members of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer will conduct a series of interviews with the candidates. If the Governance Committee determines that a potential candidate meets the needs of the Board and has the desired qualifications, it will recommend the candidate's nomination or appointment to the full Board for consideration.
WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN DIRECTORS
The Governance Committee strives to maintain an engaged, independent Board with broad and diverse experience and judgment that is committed to representing the long-term interests of our stockholders. The committee considers a wide range of factors when selecting and recruiting director candidates, including achieving:
Director "must-haves." In addition to the considerations above, we believe that all of our directors should possess the following personal attributes: integrity and sound ethical character, absence of legal or regulatory impediments, absence of conflicts of interest, demonstrated track record of achievement, ability to act in an oversight capacity, appreciation for the issues confronting a public company, adequate time to devote to the Board and its committees, and willingness to assume broad, fiduciary responsibilities on behalf of all stockholders.
HOW WE ASSESS DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Our policy and practice. We require a majority of our Board members, including all members of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee, to be independent under Nasdaq listing standards. The Board, with the assistance of the Governance Committee, considers all relevant facts and circumstances when making its independence determinations. A substantial majority of our Board – eight out of ten directors – is independent.
How we assessed independence this year. The Board has affirmatively determined that the following eight directors are independent within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards: Mrs. Boydston and Messrs. Alexander, Buckley, Bullock, Keltner, Miller, O'Leary and Vertuca. Barry J. Goldstein, who served as director until our 2018 Annual Meeting, was determined to be independent during the time he served on the Board. In making this determination, the Board found that none of these directors had a material or other disqualifying relationship with BMC. In making this determination, the Board took into account that BMC from time to time engages in business in the ordinary course with entities where our directors are employed. In each of the last three fiscal years, payments that BMC made to or received from these businesses accounted for less than 2% of the annual revenues of each of BMC and the other entities.

Table of Contents
HOW YOU CAN RECOMMEND A CANDIDATE FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD
The Governance Committee considers director candidates recommended by stockholders. Stockholders wishing to recommend a candidate may do so by writing to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's address on the last page of this proxy statement, and including all information that our Bylaws require for director nominations.
BOARD OPERATIONS
The Board is elected by stockholders to oversee management and assure that stockholders' long-term interests are being served. In furtherance of this responsibility, a key function of the Board is reviewing, approving (where appropriate) and actively monitoring management's execution on the Company's long-term strategic goals and providing advice and counsel to management on significant issues facing the Company. The Board reviews and considers the Company's strategy throughout the year, and discusses it at every Board meeting.
The Board actively engages on BMC matters throughout the year. Key touch points for the Board include:
Attendance at Board meetings. We expect all directors to attend and actively participate in all in-person and telephonic meetings of the Board (and of any committees on which they serve). In 2018, the Board held 20 meetings, the Audit Committee held seven meetings, the Compensation Committee held nine meetings, and the Governance Committee held seven meetings. Each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the committees on which he or she served during the period he or she was on the Board or committee.
Attendance at the annual stockholders meeting. Directors are also encouraged to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All of our directors then on the Board and whose terms were continuing attended our 2018 Annual Meeting.
HOW THE BOARD OVERSEES RISK
Our executive management team is responsible for managing the risks inherent in our business, and our Board oversees our executive team in the execution of its risk management function. To assist in this oversight function, our Board has overseen the development of the Company's risk management process. Management identifies and assesses the risks inherent in the business based on the likelihood of the risk occurring and the consequence to the Company if the risk were to be realized. Each year an annual risk assessment is presented to the Board identifying significant risks, including a description of any current or future mitigating actions the Company may take. The Board and Audit Committee also receive interim reports on emerging risks as they occur.
Our Board regularly discusses with management BMC's major risk exposures, their potential impact on our business and the steps we take to monitor, mitigate and control such exposures. While our Board has general oversight responsibility for risk at our Company, the Board has delegated some of its risk oversight duties to our Board committees as follows:
The full Board is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity risks and, in this regard, receives regular cybersecurity updates (at least annually) from the Company's senior information technology executives.

BOARD OVERSIGHT OF CEO SUCCESSION PLANNING
Following the CEO transition that occurred in January 2018, the Board appointed director David Keltner to serve as Interim President and CEO. The Board, through a committee and working with a leading executive search firm, conducted an extensive search to identify the individual with the right experience, vision and track record to accelerate our strategy and lead BMC into the future. The Board's search culminated with the appointment of David Flitman, who commenced service as our President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2018.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Current Board leadership structure. We currently separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO. Mr. Bullock, an independent director, serves as Chairman, and Mr. Flitman serves as President and CEO.
Why the Board believes its leadership structure is appropriate for the Company. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure to evaluate whether the structure remains appropriate for the Company. The Board has determined that the current structure is appropriate at this time in that it enables Mr. Flitman to focus on his role leading the Company as President and CEO, while enabling Mr. Bullock to continue to provide leadership on policy matters at the Board level. The Board believes that the Board leadership structure should, among other things, be informed by the needs and circumstances of the Company and the then-current membership of the Board, and that the Board should remain adaptable to shaping the leadership structure as those needs and circumstances change.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee. Each of the standing committees meets periodically throughout the year, reports its actions to the Board, receives reports from senior management, annually evaluates its performance and can retain outside advisors. The Board has adopted a written charter for each of these committees, which sets out its functions and responsibilities. These are available in the "Corporate Governance" section of our Investor Relations website at ir.buildwithbmc.com.
Committee independence. The Board has determined that each standing committee member meets the applicable Nasdaq listing standards regarding "independence," and each member is free of any relationship that would impair his or her individual exercise of independent judgment with regard to BMC. In addition, all of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee members meet the heightened independence requirements under applicable SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards.
Financial acumen. Each of our Audit Committee members meets the financial literacy requirements of the SEC and Nasdaq, and each of our Audit Committee members also qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under SEC rules.

OTHER GOVERNANCE POLICIES
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
The Company has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which you can find on our website at ir.buildwithbmc.com, that we believe reflect the Board's commitment to a system of governance that enhances corporate responsibility and accountability. The Board annually reviews these guidelines, along with the charters for the Board's standing committees, so that our policies and programs continue to reflect good corporate governance practices. In connection with the Board's review over the past two years, the Board determined to: adopt stock ownership guidelines for directors and executive officers (discussed below); expand the Board's director selection criteria beyond experience in the Company's industry to include other business experience relevant to the Company and, where appropriate, the consideration of diverse characteristics; adopt limits on the number of public company boards on which directors can serve (four other boards or, for directors who serve as a public company CEO, two other boards); require directors to seek approval before joining the board of another company; provide an oversight role for the Compensation Committee regarding stockholder engagement on executive compensation matters and the Governance Committee regarding stockholder engagement on all other matters; provide that the Governance Committee will oversee the director orientation process for new directors; and strengthen the Company's insider trading and investor communication policies.
HOW YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOARD
Stockholders may contact an individual director, the Board as a group or a specified Board committee or group, including the non-employee directors as a group, at the following address:
The Board has instructed our Corporate Secretary to review correspondence directed to the Board and not to forward certain items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board, such as resumes or business solicitations, or that are otherwise inappropriate. See our website at http://ir.buildwithbmc.com/investors/corporate-governance/contact-the-board/default.aspx for more information. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, appropriate correspondence will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Governance Committee.

BOARD INTEGRITY POLICIES
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Board has approved and adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all directors, officers and employees. In the event that we amend, or grant a waiver from, a provision of the code that applies to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or chief accounting officer and that requires disclosure under applicable SEC rules, we will disclose this within four business days on our website at ir.buildwithbmc.com.
Conflicts of interest. All directors are required to recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business or professional interests. If an actual or potential conflict of interest arises, the director is required to promptly inform the Board, which will then determine an appropriate resolution on a case-by-case basis.
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Approval Policies Our Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review, approval or ratification of transactions involving certain persons that the SEC requires to be disclosed in proxy statements, which are commonly referred to as "related person transactions." Under SEC rules, a related person is an officer, director, nominee for director, beneficial holder of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities since the beginning of the last fiscal year, or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing. Under this written policy, our Audit Committee is responsible for the review, approval and ratification of "related person transactions" between us and any related person. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a related person transaction, the Audit Committee will consider:
Related Person Transactions for 2018 Other than compensation agreements and other arrangements that are described under "Executive Compensation," since January 1, 2018, there has not been, and there is not currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or will be a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the form and amount of compensation payable to our non-employee directors and recommends any appropriate adjustments to the full Board for approval. No changes were made to our director compensation program for 2018 as a result of this review. For 2018, all members of our Board who were not employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries received compensation for their services to the Board and related committees as described below.

2018 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE
The following table sets forth the annual compensation that we paid our non-employee directors in 2018. Although currently a non-employee director, David Keltner served as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer for over eight months in 2018 and his compensation is reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Represents the grant date fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to our non-employee directors during fiscal year 2018 based on the closing market price on the date prior to grant. We used our closing market price on the grant date in order to determine the number of RSUs to award to each director. With the exception of 724 RSUs granted to Mrs. Boydston on March 20, 2018, the RSUs vest in full on the earlier of May 16, 2019, or the date of the Annual Meeting. The 724 RSUs granted to Mrs. Boydston reflect prorated equity compensation for her service from March 20, 2018 through the date of our 2018 Annual Meeting and vested in full on May 11, 2018. The grant date fair value is calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("ASC 718"). For a discussion of the assumptions used in determining the compensation cost associated with stock awards, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, each of our directors held the following number of restricted stock units and stock options: 
(a)  Mr. Rea's stock options are all fully vested. Of these options, 47,399 have an exercise price of $0.97 per share and expire on March 1, 2022, 92,502 have an exercise price of $14.00 per share and expire on August 14, 2023, and 81,300 have an exercise price of $20.34 per share and expire on July 3, 2024. 
(2)  Represents the aggregate cost of medical and dental coverage provided to Mr. Rea under the Company's broad-based group health plan and the cost to the Company of health premiums for supplemental coverage provided through a third party. Mr. Rea receives such benefits under an arrangement with the Company entered into in connection with the Merger, under which the Company has agreed to provide such coverage for so long as Mr. Rea continues to serve as a director of the Company. 
(3)  Mr. Bullock was appointed to the Compensation Committee on January 9, 2018. 
(4)  Mr. Alexander was appointed Chair of the Audit Committee on May 16, 2018. 
(5)  Mrs. Boydston joined the Board on March 20, 2018, and thus her annual retainer and annual equity grant were each prorated. 
(6)  Mr. Buckley was appointed to the Governance and Nominating Committee on May 16, 2018. 
(7)  Mr. Goldstein retired from the Board on May 16, 2018. He did not receive any equity awards in 2018.

DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Effective as of March 1, 2018, the Board adopted a policy requiring each non-employee director to own Company equity securities with an aggregate value of at least three times the director's annual cash retainer. Directors have five years from the later of the date of their election or the effective date of the policy to meet this ownership requirement. If a director does not reach his or her ownership requirement within the time period provided, the Compensation Committee will determine whether action is appropriate, and may award all future Board compensation, including any retainers for committee service, in equity until the guideline is met. As of the date of this proxy statement, all of the non-employee directors serving on the Board had met the ownership requirement or were on track to meet the ownership requirement by the applicable deadline.
2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Audit Committee has the sole responsibility for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. For 2019, the Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent auditor. PwC has served as our independent auditor since 2015, and previously served as the independent auditor for SBS from 1985 to 2015. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PwC as our independent auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Why are we asking stockholders to vote on this proposal? The Board, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, is submitting the selection of PwC to stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If stockholders do not ratify the selection of PwC, the Audit Committee will review its future selection of our independent auditor in light of that vote result. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a new independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions.

The Board, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, is submitting the selection of PwC to stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If stockholders do not ratify the selection of PwC, the Audit Committee will review its future selection of our independent auditor in light of that vote result. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a new independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions.

KEY AUDIT OVERSIGHT POLICIES AND PRACTICES
PRE-APPROVAL POLICY FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY PwC
The Audit Committee has established a policy concerning the pre-approval of services performed by the Company's external accounting firms. Under this policy, the committee reviews all engagement letters from accounting firms for non-audit services and specifically pre-approves all services to be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. As part of its review, the committee considers whether the provision of any non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of our independent auditor, and solicits the input of management and the independent auditor on this issue.

In 2018, all services provided to the Company by PwC were pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the policies and procedures described above, and all non-audit services provided to the Company by PwC were determined by the committee to be compatible with the maintenance of PwC's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.
ROTATION OF LEAD AUDIT ENGAGEMENT PARTNER
Key PwC partners assigned to our audit are rotated at least every five years. The Audit Committee and its chair oversee the selection process for each new lead engagement partner. Throughout this process, the committee and management provide input to PwC about the Company's priorities, discuss candidate qualifications and interview potential candidates put forth by the firm.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Mr. Flitman was appointed to the role of President and CEO effective as of September 26, 2018. 
(2)  Mr. Keltner served as Interim President and CEO from January 10, 2018 through September 26, 2018. Mr. Keltner also served as a director for the entire calendar year and was a non-employee director both prior to and following his service as interim President and CEO. 
(3)  Mr. Alexander left employment with the Company and resigned as a director of the Company, effective as of January 10, 2018.

(5)  Mr. McGaugh left employment with the Company effective as of March 11, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Chief Executive Officer Transition The year 2018 was one of transitional leadership for the Company. In January 2018, Peter Alexander, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, left employment with and resigned as a director of the Company. On this same date, David Keltner, a director of the Company since 2015 and a director of Stock Building Supply Holdings, Inc. since 2014, was appointed to serve as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer while the Board conducted its search for a new chief executive officer. The Board's search culminated with the appointment of David Flitman, who commenced service as our President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2018. Mr. Flitman is a proven executive with over three decades of experience and a strong track record of execution in leading distribution businesses across multiple industries, including Performance Food Group, Univar and Ecolab, and the Board is confident in his ability to drive compelling growth and value creation at the Company.
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Program Highlights
[BEGIN TABLE]
–  Annual Bonus: The Company achieved 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $265.9 million, a 32.9% increase over fiscal 2017 results, and 2018 Free Cash Flow of $166.3 million, an increase of 277% over fiscal 2017 results, which resulted in a maximum payout under our annual bonus plan. 
–  Interim CEO Compensation: As compensation for his services as our Interim President and CEO, the Compensation Committee approved an annualized base salary of $750,000, an equity award of 25,000 restricted stock units that vested six months following the date of his appointment, and a one-time cash bonus of $375,000 for Mr. Keltner. Mr. Keltner did not participate in our annual bonus program for 2018 given the interim nature of his role. 
–  CEO Employment Agreement: In August 2018, the Compensation Committee entered into a customary employment agreement with Mr. Flitman, our new President and CEO, that sets forth his compensation, severance entitlements, and includes confidentiality, invention assignment, and 24-month post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. This agreement is described in further detail under "Employment Agreements with Other NEOs" on page 32. 
–  Letter Agreement with Mr. McGaugh and Employment Agreement with Mr. Farmer: In May 2018, the Committee approved the Company's entry into an employment agreement with Mr. Farmer in an effort to align his arrangement with those of our other executive officers. In order to enhance the stability of our executive team, in August 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a letter agreement with Mr. McGaugh amending his employment agreement to confirm that the relocation of our headquarters from Atlanta, Georgia to Raleigh, North Carolina was a "good reason" trigger event under his employment agreement and to extend the period during which Mr. McGaugh may give notice of "good reason" in connection with such relocation and be eligible to receive severance benefits under his employment agreement through December 31, 2019. These agreements are described in further detail under "Employment Agreements with Other NEOs" on page 32.

Compensation Program Elements for 2018For our 2018 fiscal year, our named executive officers, other than Mr. Keltner, received the following compensation elements. Given the interim nature of his appointment, Mr. Keltner was provided with the compensation described above under "Fiscal 2018 Compensation Program Highlights – Interim CEO compensation."
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net income plus interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition costs and other items. 
(2)  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment and real estate, plus proceeds from sales of property, equipment and real estate. 
(3)  Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as Adjusted Net Income divided by our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We calculate our Adjusted Net Income as net income plus merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition costs, other items and after tax effecting those items. Adjusted Net Income may also be adjusted to eliminate the effects of other unusual or infrequent items, as determined by our Compensation Committee. 
(4)  Average ROIC is a non-GAAP measure that is the arithmetic mean of ROIC calculated for each of the three annual periods within the three-year performance period. Our ROIC is defined as Adjusted Net Operating Profit After Tax divided by average Invested Capital. 
  Adjusted Net Operating Profit After Tax is the product of (i) the sum of operating income, impairment of assets, merger and integration costs, inventory step-up charges, restructuring expenses, non-cash stock compensation expense and acquisition costs, and (ii) (x) 1.00, minus (y) the federal statutory tax rate, minus (z) the state statutory tax rate, net of federal tax. Invested Capital is defined as (i) the sum of (x) long-term debt (including the current portion), and (y) the book value of stockholders' equity, minus (ii) cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted Net Operating Profit After Tax may also be adjusted to eliminate the effects of other unusual or infrequent items, as determined by our Compensation Committee. 
(5)  In light of his September 26, 2018 appointment, Mr. Flitman was granted performance-based RSUs that vest based on the achievement of Adjusted EPS and Average ROIC performance metrics over a three-year performance period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, subject to continued service.

   Pay for Performance  Pay Competitively  Pay Equitably  Be Aligned with Stockholders  Be Transparent 
  NEO compensation is based on Company performance and varies based on the extent to which pre-established short- and long-term financial objectives are met.  We are committed to providing a total compensation program that retains our highest-performing employees and executives and attracts superior leaders to our Company.  We consider accountability, responsibility, qualifications and performance, both individually and collectively as a team, when setting equitable pay levels for our executive officers.  A significant portion of our executives' total compensation is in the form of equity-based awards, which fluctuate in value based on our share price, aligning executives' and stockholders' interests.  We strive to clearly communicate our programs to both internal and external stakeholders. Internally, participants should understand performance goals, results and the link between pay and performance. Externally, stockholders should understand how our pay programs link to our business strategies and the relationship between pay and performance.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR COMPENSATION DECISIONS
Compensation Committee, Chief Executive Officer and Board Our Compensation Committee has been responsible for the oversight, implementation and administration of all of our executive compensation plans and programs and recommends compensation plans to our Board that are consistent with our compensation philosophy, strategically positioned against our peer group and competitive with other organizations similar to ours.
Our Compensation Committee, in consultation with and upon recommendation of our Chief Executive Officer (with regard to all executive officers other than himself), reviews compensation elements and amounts for our executive officers on an annual basis and at the time of a promotion or other change in level of responsibilities, as well as when competitive circumstances or business needs may require. Our Board and Compensation Committee determine all of the components of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, which is also reviewed annually as part of our business planning for the year.
Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance and development of our other executive officers and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding performance objectives and achievement for such individuals. Our Compensation Committee meets to consider these recommendations, makes determinations as to whether and to what extent performance objectives for our executive officers have been achieved and confirms that we have effective and appropriate compensation programs in place. Our Compensation Committee undertakes a similar review of the performance and development of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Executive Officer's contribution to corporate goals. Our compensation arrangements with our executive officers are primarily based on the consolidated financial achievements of our Company established at the beginning of the year, and these arrangements reflect our commitment to compensating for the achievement of corporate or individual objectives.
Compensation Consultant During 2018, as in prior years, the Compensation Committee engaged an independent consultant, Lyons, Benenson & Company Inc. ("Lyons, Benenson") to assist with determining compensation levels. The committee retained Lyons, Benenson based upon its expertise and industry experience. Lyons, Benenson reports directly to the committee and the committee has the sole authority to retain and dismiss Lyons, Benenson and to approve Lyons, Benenson's fees. In 2018, the committee relied on Lyons, Benenson to provide a review of executive and director compensation practices of companies in our peer group, including a benchmarking analysis of base salary levels and short- and long-term incentive targets at the companies with which we compete for executive talent. In addition, in 2018, Lyons, Benenson advised on the compensation provided to Mr. Keltner in his Interim President and Chief Executive Officer role and the negotiation of new executive employment agreements with Mr. Flitman and Mr. Farmer. The Compensation Committee evaluated the independence of Lyons, Benenson and determined that Lyons, Benenson was independent and that their engagement did not present a conflict of interest after considering the independence factors enumerated in Rule 10C-1(b) under the Exchange Act.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT
Our Compensation Committee, with the assistance of Lyons, Benenson, has assessed our compensation philosophy, policies and program for our employees as they relate to our overall risk management. Based upon this assessment, we believe that any risks arising from such policies and program are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, we believe that the mix and design of the elements of executive compensation do not encourage management to assume unnecessary, excessive or inappropriate risks. These beliefs are based on a number of factors, including the following:
2019 Proxy Statement     21

BENCHMARKING
Lyons, Benenson, in consultation with our Compensation Committee, compiled a report of benchmark compensation data for executive officers holding comparable positions at comparable companies. The benchmark data included base salary, annual cash incentive plan opportunities and awards and long-term incentive award values. As was the case for 2017, the peer group of companies we used in our benchmarking survey when analyzing 2018 compensation levels consisted of the following:
All of these companies, in both the lumber and building materials distribution industry and the non-lumber and building materials distribution industries, were selected for the compensation peer group because they were considered to be significant competitors with respect to the individuals with the talent and experience needed to serve in our executive officer positions. Ply Gem Holdings, Inc. was subsequently removed from our peer group for analyzing 2019 compensation levels following its April 2018 merger with a subsidiary of Pisces Midco, Inc.
[BEGIN TABLE]
*   Based on available data as of July 2018, our net revenue was at the 71st percentile and our market capitalization was at the 40th percentile of this peer group. 
[END TABLE]
Peer group data is collected for executive positions as one factor our committee considers in setting appropriate base salary levels to attract and retain qualified executives. In general, we structure our compensation plans to provide target compensation levels and opportunities that are competitive with the median target opportunities for comparable positions in the peer group, but our pay varies from the median at the committee's discretion when warranted by differences in responsibility or function compared to similar positions in peer groups, retention considerations, cumulative performance of any particular NEO or similar considerations.
While our Compensation Committee will utilize this formal benchmarking in its consideration of compensation decisions, we expect it will continue to manage our compensation programs on a flexible basis that will allow it to respond to market and business developments as it views appropriate.
ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION
Base Salary We provide a base salary to each of our NEOs that is intended to reflect the scope of his or her responsibilities, individual performance, labor market conditions and competitive market salary levels. Base salaries are reviewed from time to time, but no less than annually, and are adjusted when warranted based on performance, changes in responsibilities and overall budget considerations. The table below sets forth the annualized base salaries for each of our NEOs as of December 31, 2018 (or September 26, 2018, in the case of Mr. Keltner):
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Mr. Alexander left employment with the Company effective as of January 10, 2018. Mr. McGaugh left employment with the Company effective as of March 11, 2019. Mr. Farmer was not an NEO for 2017.

Annual Performance-Based Cash IncentivesOur annual performance-based executive bonuses are provided under our Management Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the MIP. The MIP provides our NEOs the opportunity to earn cash payments each fiscal year. These incentive payments are intended to motivate our NEOs to work effectively to achieve challenging, but attainable financial performance goals that are aligned with the Company's strategic plan and reward them when these objectives are met or exceeded. Each NEO's target bonus amount is expressed as a percentage of base salary, which we refer to as the Target Bonus. For 2018, each NEO was eligible to receive a maximum award equal to 200% of his or her Target Bonus based on the Company's achievement against financial targets established by our Compensation Committee of Adjusted EBITDA (weighted 75%) and Free Cash Flow (weighted 25%).
The payouts upon achievement of the threshold, target and maximum performance levels set by the Compensation Committee were set at 50%, 100% and 200% of the weighted portion of the Target Bonus amount, respectively, with pro rata computations between achievement levels. If either of the threshold financial targets were not achieved, the NEOs would receive no payout under the MIP with respect to that component.
We continued to use Adjusted EBITDA under the MIP because it measures performance over the periods in which our NEOs can have significant impact, is directly linked to our long-term growth plan and is a key metric used by management and the Board to assess our operating performance. We also retained Free Cash Flow, which was first used by the Company under the 2017 MIP, as a secondary metric to encourage management focus on the Company's cash conversion cycles when executing the Company's strategic plan. The financial targets under both metrics were based on our operating plan established by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year, which is based upon certain assumptions and estimates of construction activity, growth and overall market conditions for the fiscal year. For 2018, the Board established targets for Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow that required growth over 2017 results for both of these key performance metrics. Under the MIP, the Board reserves the right to make adjustments to financial and operational goals to account for items and circumstances not contemplated at the time the goals were initially established. During 2018, the financial targets under the MIP were increased in connection with our acquisition of Shone Lumber.
The following table shows the final financial metrics established for determining payouts under the 2018 MIP for the NEOs and the calculation of the 2018 MIP payouts based on actual performance.
In light of the achievement of the maximum MIP performance targets, our NEOs received the following 2018 MIP annual bonus payments in early 2019: Mr. Flitman: $411,918 (prorated for his partial year of service), Mr. Major: $875,500, Ms. Hamblet: $667,276, Mr. McGaugh: $1,127,500, Mr. Farmer: $412,500, and Mr. Alexander: $51,370 (prorated for his partial year of service).
BONUSES GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH LEADERSHIP TRANSITION The Compensation Committee approved a one-time cash bonus in the amount of $375,000 for Mr. Keltner in August 2018. This bonus was provided in recognition of Mr. Keltner's agreement to continue to serve as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer until Mr. Flitman's Start Date, which was beyond his originally anticipated six-month term, and the fact that he was not provided the opportunity to participate in the Company's annual bonus program for 2018.
The Compensation Committee also approved a one-time cash bonus in the amount of $200,000 for Mr. Flitman to compensate him for his lost annual bonus opportunity with his prior employer. Under the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Flitman must reimburse the Company the full amount of this bonus if he voluntarily terminates employment without good reason or the Company terminates him for cause (each as defined in his employment agreement) prior to September 26, 2019.
Equity Incentives We maintain the Stock Building Supply Holdings, Inc. 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the "2013 Incentive Plan"). The purpose of the 2013 Incentive Plan is to provide incentives that attract, retain and motivate high-performing officers, directors, employees and consultants by providing them a proprietary interest in our long-term success and compensation based on their performance in fulfilling their responsibilities to our Company.

ANNUAL EQUITY AWARDS For 2018, the Compensation Committee and the Board determined to provide approximately 50% of each named executive officer's annual equity award value in the form of performance-based RSUs and approximately 50% in the form of time-based RSUs. Mr. Alexander did not receive a 2018 annual equity award in light of his January 10th departure, and Mr. Keltner and Mr. Flitman received alternative equity grants given the timing and nature of their respective appointments. Thus, the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board approved the following annual equity grants on February 21, 2018, which grants were effective on March 1, 2018. In determining the size of these grants, the Compensation Committee considered the compensation levels of similarly situated executive officers in our peer group, the Company's 2017 performance, and Mr. Keltner's review of the executive officers' individual performance over the prior fiscal year.
OTHER AWARDS In connection with Mr. Keltner's and Mr. Flitman's respective appointments, the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board approved the following special equity grants in 2018:
Retirement, Health, Welfare and Limited Personal Benefits We provide our NEOs with benefits that we believe are reasonable and in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. Consistent with our compensation philosophy, we currently intend to maintain these benefits for our NEOs; however, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may revise, amend or add to an officer's benefits if it deems it advisable. We believe these benefits are generally similar to benefits provided by comparable companies.
We maintain a broad-based tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan, which allows eligible participants, including our NEOs, to defer from 0% to 50% of cash compensation up to the maximum amount allowed under Internal Revenue Service guidelines. From time to time, we make contributions to our employees' individual 401(k) accounts as a performance incentive. For 2018, we also provided a Company matching contribution equal to 1/3 of up to 6% of compensation contributed to the plan. This matching contribution has been increased to 1/2 of up to 6% of compensation contributed to the plan effective as of January 1, 2019. Participants are always vested in their own contributions to the plan and are generally fully vested in contributions by us after a five-year vesting period. We do not currently offer any defined benefit or supplemental executive retirement plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plans for executive officers but may elect to do so in the future.
We offer broad-based medical, dental, vision, life insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance for all eligible employees, including our NEOs. Certain of our NEOs participate in a health care program administered by ArmadaCare, which provides reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket health care expenses.
In 2018, the Company also provided Mr. Flitman with relocation assistance and moving expense reimbursement when relocating to our Raleigh, North Carolina office. In addition, certain of our executive officers received automobile allowances the costs of which are reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation Table" included below.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPENSATION BEST PRACTICES
Accounting and Tax Considerations Section 162(m) generally limits the deductibility of compensation paid to covered employees, including our NEOs, to $1 million during any fiscal year. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for "performance-based compensation" was repealed effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to any covered employee in excess of $1 million will not be deductible, unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. Although our Board and Compensation Committee have historically considered the deductibility of compensation elements under Section 162(m) when determining elements of compensation, including our 2017 performance-based RSUs, we have preserved the flexibility to pay compensation that was not intended to be tax deductible when we determined that it was in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, the rules and guidance issued under Section 162(m) are complicated, and may change from time to time. Thus, there is no guarantee that compensation awarded in prior years will actually qualify as deductible under Section 162(m).
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote We received the support of approximately 99.9% of the votes cast at our 2018 Annual Meeting to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as described in our 2018 proxy statement. The Compensation Committee generally considered this very high level of support when reviewing the structure of our compensation program, but did not make any specific changes to program elements or policies as a result of this vote.
Recoupment Policy We are subject to the recoupment requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The 2013 Incentive Plan also provides that awards granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan are subject to recoupment, including the clawback of "incentive-based compensation" under the Exchange Act, or under any applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.
We also maintain a recoupment policy, pursuant to which the Compensation Committee may determine in its discretion if it will require an individual executive officer, a group of executive officers or all executive officers to reimburse the Company for certain incentive compensation paid to them if the financial results upon which the incentive compensation was based are restated or if an executive officer willfully engages in conduct that, among other things, is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company. The recoupment policy permits the Compensation Committee to take into account the following considerations when determining whether to recoup incentive compensation: 
We believe our recoupment policy is sufficiently broad to reduce the potential risk that an executive officer would intentionally misstate results in order to benefit under an incentive program and provides a right of recovery in the event that an executive officer took actions that, in hindsight, should not have been rewarded. Our recoupment policy may be adjusted in the future as determined appropriate by the Compensation Committee or as regulatory requirements are adopted.
Hedging and Pledging Policies Our directors, officers, employees and consultants are prohibited from engaging in any hedging or monetization transactions involving Company securities. In addition, directors, officers, employees and consultants are prohibited from holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan without pre-clearance from the Company's General Counsel.
Stock Ownership Guidelines In an effort to ensure that senior officers have a significant ownership stake in the Company that aligns the long-term interests of executive officers and stockholders, the Company implemented stock ownership guidelines applicable to all NEOs effective as of March 1, 2018. Under these guidelines, our Chief Executive Officer is required to own Company equity securities with an aggregate value equal to at least five times his base salary. Each other NEO is required to own Company equity securities with an aggregate value of at least three times his or her base salary. Each NEO has five years from the later of the date of their employment in a covered role or the effective date of the policy to meet this ownership requirement. Shares of Company stock owned outright, vested options, vested performance shares and unvested time-based restricted stock units are counted when determining whether the guideline has been achieved. As of the date of this proxy statement, all of our NEOs had met their ownership requirement or were on track to meet the ownership requirement by the applicable deadline.

In exchange for a general release of claims, the Separation Agreement provided that Mr. Alexander would receive: (i) a lump sum of $1,500,000, payable within 75 days following his separation; (ii) continuation of his automobile perquisite benefits for 30 days following his separation, which Mr. Alexander did not utilize, and a prorated reimbursement for his life insurance premium for the period between the date of the annual renewal immediately preceding January 10, 2018 through February 9, 2018, which Mr. Alexander also did not utilize; (iii) his 2017 annual MIP bonus based on actual performance (which was $0) and the $51,370 prorated portion of his 2018 MIP annual bonus, which was paid when bonuses for 2018 were paid to other senior executives; and (iv) payment of $39,365, payable within 75 days following his separation, which amount represents the approximate cost of monthly COBRA continuation premiums for health, dental and vision insurance for a period of 24 months following his separation date. In accordance with the terms of the 2013 Incentive Plan, all of Mr. Alexander's unvested equity awards were forfeited on his separation date.The Separation Agreement also confirmed Mr. Alexander's continuing obligations under restrictive covenants, including a one-year post-termination non-solicitation covenant, that he had previously agreed to with the Company and included a mutual non-disparagement provision.

Employment Agreements with Other NEOs With the exception of Mr. Keltner, given the interim nature of his 2018 role, we have entered into employment agreements with each of our other NEOs, which generally specify base salary levels and target annual bonus opportunities (which remain subject to annual review), and reimbursement and benefit plan participation, as well as provide for post-termination payments upon certain qualifying termination events. Although somewhat similar, these agreements are individually negotiated and the terms of each are summarized in the table that follows.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Payments and Benefits upon a Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason within 90 days Preceding or 6 Months (or 12 Months for Mr. Major) Following a Change in Control  –Severance payment equal to the product of 3.0 times the sum of (a) his annualized base salary and (b) his target annual cash bonus, payable in installments over 24 months; and –Continued participation in the Company's group health plan for up to 18 months, subject to certain limitations specified in the agreement; –100% accelerated vesting of all unvested time-based equity awards; and –100% accelerated vesting of all performance-based equity awards at target level. –Severance payment equal to the product of 2.5 times the sum of (a) his highest annual base salary rate in effect over the prior two years and (b) his highest target bonus or annual cash bonus actually paid over the prior two years, whichever is greater; –Reimbursement for the marginal cost of COBRA benefits for 18 months; and –100% accelerated vesting of all unvested time-based equity awards. –Severance payment in the form of salary continuation for a period of 24 months; –An amount equal to two times her target annual bonus paid when the annual cash bonus for such year is paid to other executives of the Company; –Continued participation in the Company's group health plan for up to 12 months, subject to certain limitations specified in the agreement; –100% accelerated vesting of all unvested time-based equity awards; and –100% accelerated vesting of all performance-based equity awards at target level. –Severance payment in the form of salary continuation for a period of 24 months; –An amount equal to two times his target annual bonus paid when the annual cash bonus for such year is paid to other executives of the Company; –Continued participation in the Company's group health plan for up to 12 months, subject to certain limitations specified in the agreement; –100% accelerated vesting of all unvested time-based equity awards; and –100% accelerated vesting of all performance-based equity awards at target level. –Severance payment in the form of salary continuation for a period of 24 months; –An amount equal to two times his target annual bonus paid when the annual cash bonus for such year is paid to other executives of the Company; –Continued participation in the Company's group health plan for up to 12 months, subject to certain limitations specified in the agreement; –100% accelerated vesting of all unvested time-based equity awards; and –100% accelerated vesting of all performance-based equity awards at target level.

As used in the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: (i) approval by the Board of a plan of liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company; (ii) the consummation of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) any person (other than the Company, any company owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of common stock of the Company, and for Mr. Major, Gores Building Holdings, which we refer to as Gores, or its affiliates, or for Mr. Farmer, Ms. Hamblet and Mr. Farmer, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under any employee benefit plan of the Company), becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities; and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, which we refer to as a Merger Partner, as a result of which (A) the voting securities in the Merger Partner immediately prior thereto represent more than 50% of the combined voting power in the surviving entity immediately thereafter, or (B) the stockholders of the Merger Partner immediately prior to such transaction have the power to elect or designate a majority of the members of the board of the Company or the surviving entity. Under Mr. Major's employment agreement, the decrease of the equity holdings of Gores or any of its affiliates in the Company does not constitute a "change in control," unless such reduction in equity holdings is part of a transaction that constitutes a "change in control" pursuant to clauses (iii) or (iv) above.
The terms Cause and Good Reason are individually defined in each of the agreements, as amended where applicable.
Payments to Mr. Alexander and Mr. Keltner Given his termination of employment on January 10, 2018, Mr. Alexander received the payments and benefits described above under "Separation Agreements with Mr. Alexander." Mr. Keltner terminated employment with the Company on September 26, 2018, returning to his non-employee director position with the Company.

Payments to Other Named Executive Officers The table below reflects amounts that would have been payable to each of our other named executive officers assuming their employment was terminated on December 31, 2018 and assuming that the NEO executed a general release of claims against us. For a description of the amounts reflected below, see the "Employment Agreements with Other NEOs" section above.
CEO PAY RATIO
The 2018 annual total compensation of the median compensated employee was $37,409; our CEO's 2018 annual total compensation for purposes of this pay ratio was $6,094,360, and the ratio of these amounts was 1-to-163. Our CEO, David Flitman, became our CEO on September 26, 2018, and for purposes of the pay ratio calculation, we annualized his compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 27 (specifically, his base salary, cash bonus and all other compensation) as if he were CEO for the full fiscal year. Our pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll records. As permitted by SEC rules, for our fiscal 2018 pay ratio reported above, we used the same median employee that we used for our fiscal 2017 pay ratio, as we believe there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. We identified the median compensated employee from our employee population as of December 31, 2017 using total cash compensation paid to our employees during fiscal 2017.
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

STOCK OWNERSHIP TABLE
The following table contains information about the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 1, 2019 (unless otherwise noted), by:
Percentages of common stock owned are based on 66,594,318 shares outstanding as of March 1, 2019.
Beneficial ownership for the purposes of the following table is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting thereof, or to dispose or direct the disposition thereof or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. The number of shares deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned includes shares of restricted stock and shares issuable upon settlement of restricted stock units that will vest within 60 days of March 1, 2019, and options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 1, 2019. These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing the ownership percentage of any other person. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this table and subject to applicable community property laws, we believe that each stockholder identified in the table possesses sole voting and investment power over all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by the stockholder. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each of the individuals named below is the Company's address listed on the last page of this proxy statement.
2019 Proxy Statement     35

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports with the SEC regarding their initial ownership of the Company's common stock and changes in their ownership. As a practical matter, the Company assists its directors and officers by monitoring transactions and completing and filing Section 16 reports on their behalf. Based solely on a review of the reports filed for fiscal 2018 and related written representations, we believe that all of our directors and executive officers filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a), except that one Form 4 to report a sale of shares for Mike Farmer was inadvertently filed late due to administrative error.

APPENDIX A – NON-GAAP MEASURES
Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company believes that this measure provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition costs and other items.
Company management uses Adjusted EBITDA for trend analyses and for purposes of determining management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and the Board. The Company believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other distribution and retail companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, the Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Company management does not consider this measure in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. Some of these limitations are: (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay taxes; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (v) although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and (vi) Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing non-cash stock-based compensation. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP results. Readers should review the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.
