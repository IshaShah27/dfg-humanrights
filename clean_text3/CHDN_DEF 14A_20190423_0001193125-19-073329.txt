Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
2018 was a strong year for your company. 
We started the year by completing the sale of Big Fish Games for $990 million and in February, we completed a Dutch Auction tender offer for $500 million of our shares with a portion of the sale proceeds. 
As tradition has it in early May, Churchill Downs hosted the 144th running of The Kentucky Derby. Despite being the wettest Kentucky Derby ever, Churchill Downs set all-time wagering records for the week and the Oaks and Derby races. Our team also completed two significant capital projects – the addition of the Starting Gate Suites and the new transportation / parking lot upgrade – both of which improved our guests' experiences and provided additional prime seating capacity. We have exciting plans for additional strategic investments in this iconic asset that will attract guests who want to experience the mystique and magic that only The Kentucky Derby can create. 
We also demonstrated our ability to drive organic growth through strategic capital investment projects at our casino properties, which directly benefit our guests. Our expansion into historical racing machine (HRM) facilities in Kentucky is another example of our organic growth efforts. We opened the first HRM facility in Louisville, KY in September 2018 with 900 machines, and we were pleased to be awarded the racing license for Oak Grove, Kentucky, which is an hour north of Nashville, TN. We have started the construction of this $150 million facility which initially will include 1,200 historical racing machines, a 125-room hotel, and a 1,200-person capacity grandstand. 
We were also successful in growing our casino portfolio through acquisitions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Ocean Downs in Berlin, MDIn August 2018, we completed the Ocean Downs / Saratoga Transaction  which resulted in 100% ownership in Ocean Downs and the sale of our interests in Saratoga while retaining the rights in New York and Colorado for online sports betting and iGaming in the future.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Presque Isle Downs and Casino in Erie, PAWe completed the previously announced acquisition of  Presque Isle Downs and Casino on January 11, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, ILWe completed the transactions necessary to acquire ~61% of  Midwest Gaming, the parent company of Rivers Casino Des Plaines on March 6, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Lady Luck Nemacolin in Farmington, PAWe completed the transaction to acquire certain assets and  the management agreement of Lady Luck Nemacolin on March 8, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
With the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling opening the doors to legal sports betting in May 2018, we began our expansion into sports betting and iGaming with the launch of our retail BetAmerica Sportsbook at our two Mississippi casino properties in August 2018 and our online BetAmerica Sportsbook and Casino Gaming platform in New Jersey in February 2019. 
In 2019, we are planning to launch our retail BetAmerica Sportsbook at our Presque Isle facility and our online BetAmercia Sportsbook and Casino gaming platform in Pennsylvania. We hope to expand our sports betting and iGaming offering into additional states in the future. The breadth of experience our team has from running TwinSpires (the industry-leading platform for legal online horse racing wagering) coupled with our online sports betting and iGaming industry experience provides the foundation necessary to lead this exciting expansion. 
We are proud that we have returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders over the last five years, while delivering strong financial results and investing strategically to drive long-term sustainable growth. As we look to 2019 and beyond, we have strong cash flow and a solid balance sheet with capacity to support organic growth, strategic acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases to create long-term value for our shareholders. 
A special thanks to our team members who have demonstrated their capabilities, commitment, and determination to deliver sustainable long-term results in this dynamic environment for you, our shareholders.

PROXY STATEMENT 
Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 23, 2019 
The Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors" or "Board") of Churchill Downs Incorporated ("Company," "CDI," or "CHDN") is soliciting proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Tuesday, April 23, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (the "Annual Meeting"), at the Four Seasons Hotel, 120 E. Delaware Place, Chicago, Illinois 60611, and any adjournments thereof. Certain officers and directors of the Company and persons acting under their instruction may also solicit proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors by means of telephone calls, personal interviews and mail at no additional expense to the Company. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") was first mailed on or about March 13, 2019. 
Recent Stock Split 
On January 25, 2019, the Company effected a three-for-one stock split of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock, and our Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on January 28, 2019 (the "Stock Split"). All share and per-share information presented in this Proxy Statement has been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. 
Voting Rights 
Only holders of record of the Company's Common Stock, no par value ("Common Stock"), on March 1, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, 40,321,795 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each shareholder has one vote per share on all matters coming before the Annual Meeting. The shareholders of the Company do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Abstentions or "withhold" votes, as applicable, and broker non-votes are not counted in determining the number of votes required for the election of a director or passage of any matter submitted to the shareholders. Abstentions or "withhold" votes and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. For more information regarding broker non-votes, see "What is a broker non-vote?" below. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, to ensure the presence of a quorum, please vote over the Internet or by telephone as instructed in these materials as promptly as possible. If a shareholder executes and returns a proxy card, but does not specify otherwise, the shares represented by the shareholder's proxy will be voted: (i) for the election of each of the two director nominees listed below under "Election of Directors"; (ii) for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019; (iii) for the advisory approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and (iv) in the discretion of the person or persons voting the proxies, on such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof.

Voting Instructions and Information 
When and where is our Annual Meeting? 
We will hold our Annual Meeting on Tuesday, April 23, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, at the Four Seasons Hotel, located at 120 E. Delaware Place, Chicago, Illinois 60611. 
How are we distributing our proxy materials? 
In accordance with the "notice and access" rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each shareholder of record (the "full set delivery" option), we are furnishing proxy materials to our shareholders over the Internet (the "notice only" option). A company may use either option, "notice only" or "full set delivery," for all of its shareholders or may use one method for some shareholders and the other method for others. We believe the "notice only" process expedites shareholders' receipt of proxy materials and reduces the costs and environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. The Company will bear the entire cost of the solicitation. 
On March 13, 2019, we began mailing a Notice to our shareholders containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and vote online, as well as instructions on how to receive paper copies of these documents for shareholders who so select. This Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K are also available at http://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com/proxy. 
Who can vote at the Annual Meeting? 
You are entitled to vote or direct the voting of your shares of CHDN Common Stock if you were a shareholder of record or if you held CHDN Common Stock in "street name" at the close of business on the Record Date (Friday, March 1, 2019). On that date, 40,321,795 shares of CHDN Common Stock were outstanding. Each share of CHDN Common Stock held by you on the Record Date is entitled to one vote. 
How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? 
We must have a "quorum" to conduct the Annual Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the Annual Meeting, it will be deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the Annual Meeting and for any adjournment of the Annual Meeting, unless a new record date must be set for the adjourned meeting. 
What do I need to attend, and vote at, the Annual Meeting? 
If you plan on attending the Annual Meeting, please remember to bring photo identification with you, such as a driver's license. In addition, if you hold shares in "street name" and would like to attend the Annual Meeting, you must bring an account statement or other acceptable evidence of ownership of CHDN Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date. Only CHDN shareholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date will be permitted to attend the Annual Meeting. In order to vote at the Annual Meeting if you hold shares in "street name," you will also need a valid "legal proxy," which you can obtain by contacting your account representative at the broker, bank or similar institution through which you hold your shares. 
What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
The following proposals from the Company will be considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  To elect the two (2) Class II Directors identified in this Proxy Statement for a term of three (3) years  (Proposal No. 1);

What is a broker non-vote?
Brokers, banks or other nominees holding shares on behalf of a beneficial owner may vote those shares in their discretion on certain "routine" matters even if they do not receive timely voting instructions from the beneficial owner. With respect to "non-routine" matters, the broker, bank or other nominee is not permitted to vote shares for a beneficial owner without timely received voting instructions. The only routine matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting is the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. The remaining proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting are considered non-routine. 
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee does not vote on a non-routine matter because the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided voting instructions with regard to such matter. If a broker, bank or other nominee exercise their discretionary voting authority on the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, such shares will be considered present at the Annual Meeting for quorum purposes and broker non-votes will occur as to each of the other proposals presented at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes will have no impact on the voting results of the election of directors or the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
How will my shares be voted if I return a blank proxy card or a blank voting instruction card? 
If you are a holder of record of shares of our common stock and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  "FOR" each of the two (2) director nominees identified in this Proxy Statement under "Election  of Directors" to the Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  "FOR" the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's  independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  "FOR" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis,  the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares in street name via a broker, bank or other nominee and return a signed but blank voting instruction card (and do not otherwise provide the broker, bank or other nominee with voting instructions), your shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● will be voted in accordance with the brokers, banks or other nominees discretion on routine  matters, which includes only the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● will not be counted in connection with the election of directors, the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the executive compensation of the Companys named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, or any other non-routine matters  that are properly presented at the Annual Meeting. For each of these proposals, your shares will be treated as broker non-votes.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board knows of no matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals described above. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting upon which a vote properly may be taken, shares represented by all proxies received by us on the proxy card will be voted with respect thereto as permitted and in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.

(1)  The Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan allows directors to defer receipt of all or part of  their retainer and meeting fees in a deferred share account until after their service on the Board has ended. This account allows the director, in effect, to invest his or her deferred cash compensation in Company Common Stock. Funds in this account  are credited as hypothetical shares of Common Stock based on the market price of the stock at the time the compensation would otherwise have been earned. Hypothetical dividends are reinvested in additional shares based on the market price of the  stock on the date dividends are paid. All shares in the deferred share accounts are hypothetical and are not issued or transferred until the director ends his or her service on the Board. Upon the end of Board service, the shares are issued or  transferred to the director. In 2018, Mr. Fealy, Mr. Grissom, and Mr. Harrington deferred all of their 2018 directors' fees into a deferred share account under the plan, while Mr. Bridgeman deferred 50% of his 2018  directors' fees into a deferred share account under the plan. As adjusted for the Stock Split, as of December 31, 2018, Mr. Bridgeman had 4,838 deferred shares, Mr. Richard Duchossois had 7,839 deferred shares, Mr. Fealy had  33,628 deferred shares, Mr. Grissom had 1,512 deferred shares, and Mr. Harrington had 31,607 deferred shares under the plan.

The RSUs vest one year from the date of grant, subject to the director's continued service through the vesting date. At  the time a director ceases being a director of the Company, the Company will issue one share of Common Stock for each vested RSU held by such director. As adjusted for the Stock Split, as of December 31, 2018, Mr. Bridgeman had 12,399  RSUs, Mr. Richard Duchossois had 17,810 RSUs, Mr. Fealy had 17,810 RSUs, Mr. Grissom had 1,465 RSUs, Mr. Harrington had 17,810 RSUs, Ms. Lloyd had 1,465 RSUs, and Mr. Rankin had 17,810 RSUs.

Share Ownership Guidelines 
As memorialized in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board expects all directors to display confidence in the Company by ownership and retention of a meaningful amount of the Company's Common Stock. Pursuant to the Company's insider trading policy, all directors are subject to the Company's anti-hedging policy, which prohibits hedging and monetization transactions with respect to the Company's Common Stock. As a result, each director is expected to own shares with a fair market value equal to five (5) times the director's annual retainer. Each director appointed or elected to the Board has five (5) years from the date of appointment or election to the Board to meet this requirement. Compliance is measured at the five (5) year anniversary date of the director's appointment or election. Each director's continuing compliance with the ownership guidelines will be measured in the year he or she stands for re-election and will be considered as one of the criteria for nomination by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The chart below shows each current director's compliance with the ownership guidelines calculated as of December 31, 2018, other than with respect to Mr. Carstanjen, who is subject to maintaining holdings of the Company's Common Stock equal to at least six (6) times his base annual salary, pursuant to the Key Executive Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines, as further described in the "Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines" section below. Furthermore, deferred shares acquired by directors under the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and RSUs granted as director compensation are included for purposes of measuring compliance with the Company's share ownership guidelines. The share information in the following table has been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Stock Split.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board of Directors is responsible for providing effective governance over the Company's affairs. The Company's corporate governance practices are designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our shareholders and to promote honesty and integrity throughout the Company. 
During the past year, we continued to review our corporate governance policies and practices and compare them to those suggested by various authorities in corporate governance and the practices of other public companies. We have also reviewed guidance and interpretations provided by the SEC and Nasdaq. 
Copies of the current charter, as approved by our Board, for each of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees and a copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct (along with any amendments or waivers related to the Code of Conduct) are available on our corporate website, http://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com, under the "Corporate Governance" subheading under the "Investors" tab. 
Shareholder Communications 
Shareholders may send communications to the Company's Board of Directors addressed to the Board of Directors or to any individual director c/o Churchill Downs Incorporated, 600 N. Hurstbourne Parkway, Ste. 400, Louisville, Kentucky 40222. Any correspondence addressed to the Board of Directors in care of the Company is forwarded to the Board of Directors without review by management. 
Board Leadership Structure 
R. Alex Rankin is the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board continues to deem it advisable to maintain certain aspects of its governance structure to assure effective independent oversight. These governance practices include maintaining executive sessions of the independent directors after each Board meeting, annual performance evaluations of the CEO by the independent directors, and separate roles for the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the offices of the Chairman of the Board and CEO may be either combined or separated, in the Board's discretion; provided, that if the Board designates one individual to serve as the Chairman of the Board and the CEO, the Board will then designate an independent director to serve as the Lead Independent Director. The Board is currently led by an independent Chairman, Mr. Rankin. The Board believes that separating the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board is the most appropriate structure at this time. Separating the roles of Chairman of the Board ensures that our CEO is able to more exclusively focus on this role. The Board also believes that an independent Chairman of the Board allows for independent oversight of management, increases management accountability, and encourages an objective evaluation of management's performance relative to compensation. 
Oversight of Company Risk 
As part of its responsibility to oversee the management, business and strategy of the Company, the Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight. While the Board of Directors as a whole performs certain risk oversight functions directly, such as its ongoing review, approval and monitoring of the Company's fundamental business and financial strategies and major corporate actions, the majority of the Board of Directors' risk oversight functions is carried out through the operation of its committees. Each committee oversees risk management within its assigned areas of responsibility, as described below in the discussion of committee responsibilities. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and risk management practices, as well as its compliance programs. The Compensation Committee's responsibilities include oversight of the risks associated with the Company's compensation policies and practices, as well as its managerial development and succession plans. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees the risks related to the Company's corporate governance structure and processes. 
Board Evaluations 
The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to assist in determining whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. The Nominating and Governance Committee solicits comments from all directors and reports annually to the

 Board with an assessment of the Board's performance and how its committees are functioning. This will be discussed with the full Board following the end of each fiscal year. The assessment focuses on the Board's contribution to the Company and specifically focuses on areas in which the Board or management believes that the Board could improve. 
Board Meetings and Committees 
Four (4) meetings of the Board of Directors were held during the last fiscal year. During the fiscal year, all incumbent directors attended at least 75% of their Board and committee meetings for the period for which they served. The Company encourages its directors to attend the Annual Meeting each year. Each of the directors then serving on the Board (other than Messrs. Craig J. Duchossois, Robert L. Evans and G. Watts Humphrey, each of whom did not stand for re-election) attended the Company's annual meeting on April 24, 2018. 
The Board has determined that all of the directors of the Company who served during any part of the last completed fiscal year are "independent directors," as defined under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), except William C. Carstanjen, due to his position as CEO of the Company. 
As required by the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors currently has four (4) standing committees: the Executive, Audit, Compensation, and the Nominating and Governance Committees. 
No Director Emeritus serves on any Board committee. The current composition of the committees is illustrated in the table below, along with the number of meetings held in 2018.

Audit Committee 
The primary purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility in monitoring management's conduct of the Company's financial reporting process and overseeing the Company's risk assessment and risk management practices. The Audit Committee is generally responsible for monitoring the integrity of the financial reporting process, systems of internal controls and financial statements and other financial reports provided by the Company to any governmental or regulatory body, the public or other users thereof, as well as overseeing the processes by which management assesses the Company's exposure to cybersecurity and other risks and evaluating the guidelines and policies governing the Company's monitoring, control and minimization of such exposures.

[END TABLE]
We have a formal enterprise risk management program that falls under the leadership of our executive team with oversight from the Audit Committee. The purpose of this program is to promote risk-intelligent decision making and, in turn, increase the likelihood of achieving our operational objectives. Our Board of Directors is regularly advised of potential organizational risks and supporting mitigating policies. 
The Company's Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Company's Audit Committee are independent as defined under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2) and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. 
Four (4) meetings of the Audit Committee were held during the last fiscal year. The Audit Committee reviews the adequacy of its charter on an annual basis. 
The Board of Directors has determined that Daniel P. Harrington and Karole F. Lloyd are "audit committee financial experts" as defined by regulations promulgated by the SEC. 
Compensation Committee 
Responsibilities of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors operates under a written charter and is comprised entirely of directors meeting the independence requirements of Nasdaq and Rule 10C-1(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. The Board established the Compensation Committee to assist it in discharging the Board's responsibilities relating to compensation of the Company's CEO, each of the Company's other executive officers, and the Company's non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for decisions relating to all compensation plans, policies and perquisites as they affect the CEO and other executive officers and may form and delegate authority to subcommittees when it deems appropriate.

Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee performed an assessment of whether risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for all employees during 2018, including non-executive officers, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Each policy and plan was evaluated based on certain elements of risk, including, but not limited to, (i) the mix of fixed and variable pay, (ii) types of performance metrics, (iii) performance goals and payout curves, (iv) payment timing and adjustments, (v) equity incentives, and (vi) stock ownership requirements and trading policies. Based on this evaluation, an assessment of each plan was created, along with an overall assessment of compensation risk to the Company. After evaluation and discussion, the Committee determined that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Company's Nominating and Governance Committee operates under a written charter and is responsible for establishing the criteria for and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee provides oversight with regard to the Company's programs for dealing with governance issues. 
Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Policy on Board Composition, the Nominating and Governance Committee determines criteria regarding personal qualifications needed for Board membership and the Committee considers, reviews qualifications and recommends qualified candidates for Board membership. In doing so, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the composition of the Board and the Company's strategic plans to determine its needs with regard to Board composition and identify candidates with the appropriate skill sets and qualifications. While the Company does not have a formal policy on diversity for members of the Board of Directors, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Policy on Board Composition specifically provide that diversity of race and gender, as well as general diversity of backgrounds and experience represented on the Board of Directors are factors to consider in evaluating potential directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee sometimes employs an outside consultant to identify nominees with the skill sets, experience and backgrounds that suit the Company's needs. 
A candidate for the Company's Board of Directors should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values and be committed to representing the long-term interests of the Company's various constituencies. In considering a candidate for nomination as a member of the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider criteria such as independence; occupational background, including principal occupation (i.e., chief executive officer, attorney, accountant, investment banker, or other pertinent occupation); level and type of business experience (i.e., financial, lending, investment, media, racing industry, casino and gaming, technology, etc.) diversity in race and gender, number of boards on which the individual serves, and the general diversity of backgrounds and experience represented on the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Policy on Board Composition and recommends changes to the Board. It also evaluates the performance of the Board as a whole and provides feedback to the Board on how the directors, the committees and the Board are functioning. Finally, it evaluates Board of Director practices at the Company and other well-managed companies on an annual basis and recommends appropriate changes to the Board and/or its practices. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee receives and considers issues raised by shareholders or other stakeholders in the Company and recommends appropriate responses to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider recommendations for director candidates submitted by shareholders. Such questions, comments or recommendations should be submitted in writing to the Nominating and Governance Committee in care of the Office of the Secretary at 600 N. Hurstbourne Parkway, Ste. 400, Louisville, Kentucky 40222. The Nominating and Governance Committee, in having adopted criteria to be considered for membership on its Board, considers such candidates applying such criteria and follows the recommendation process noted above. Recommendations by shareholders that are made in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration as recommendations from other sources.

PROPOSAL TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 (Proposal No. 2) 
On February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors, on recommendation from the Audit Committee, selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. PwC has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since the Company's 1990 fiscal year. 
Although the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws do not require that the Company's shareholders ratify the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of PwC to the Company's shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. This proposal will be approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. If the appointment is not ratified, the Company's Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Company's Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.

ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (Proposal No. 3) 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company's shareholders are entitled to a vote to approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers ("NEOs") as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. In accordance with the preference expressed by shareholders, the Company is holding such advisory votes on an annual basis. 
The Company has a "pay-for-performance" philosophy that forms the foundation of all decisions regarding compensation of the Company's NEOs. This compensation philosophy, and the program structure approved by the Compensation Committee, is central to the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain individuals who can achieve superior financial results while also aligning the interests of the executives with the interests of shareholders over the long-term. This approach has resulted in the Company's ability to attract and retain the executive talent necessary to guide the Company successfully during a period of growth and transformation. Please refer to "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Summary" for an overview of the compensation of the Company's NEOs. 
This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs by voting FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure in this Proxy Statement." 
This vote is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company. The Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinions of the Company's shareholders. Should there be a significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, the Board will consider those shareholders' concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
This proposal will be approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action.

Executive Summary 
Churchill Downs Incorporated is an industry-leading provider of racing, gaming, and online entertainment and wagering. As such, our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, engage, motivate and retain highly talented executives and key employees to achieve our strategic plans and deliver financial returns to shareholders over both the short-term and long-term. One of the key objectives of our executive compensation program is to link executives' pay to their performance and their advancement of the Company's long-term performance and business strategies. Other objectives include aligning the executives' interests with those of shareholders and encouraging high-performing executives to remain with the Company over the course of their careers. We believe that the amount of compensation for each Named Executive Officer (NEO) reflects each individual's extensive management experience, high performance and exceptional service to Churchill Downs Incorporated and our shareholders. We also believe that the Company's compensation strategies have been effective in attracting executive talent and promoting performance and retention. 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the Company's executive compensation policies and programs and how they apply to our NEOs (the senior executives included in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 41). It also describes the actions and decisions of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee" or "Committee"), which oversees the executive compensation program and determines the compensation of the NEOs. A detailed discussion of the Committee's structure, roles and responsibilities, and related matters can be found under "Compensation Committee" on pages 17-19. As noted above, all share and per-share information presented in this in this Proxy Statement has been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split, including all such figures included in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the executive compensation tables that follow. 
Our long-term incentive goals are based on operational results that the Committee believes drive Company and shareholder success over multi-year performance periods. Certain metrics the Company uses to determine this success are as follows (see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 10-K for Fiscal Year 2018 for reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, and the discussion of Long-Term Incentives beginning on page 35):

Big Fish Games 
On November 29, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to sell its mobile gaming subsidiary, Big Fish Games, Inc. and its specified subsidiaries ("Big Fish"), to Aristocrat Technologies, Inc. (the "Transaction"). On January 9, 2018, the Company completed the Transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $990.0 million, subject to adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Transaction, the Company and Mr. Paul Thelen ( then-current President of Big Fish), entered into a separation agreement and release effective as of the closing date of the Transaction. Although Mr. Thelen is no longer an employee of the Company, under SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, Mr. Thelen is considered an NEO. Because of his limited tenure with the Company during 2018 and his unique compensation arrangements for 2018, we have included a discussion of Mr. Thelen's 2018 compensation arrangements in the section entitled "Compensation Arrangements for President of Big Fish" below rather than throughout the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.

 end, the Compensation Committee evaluates the pay practices of its peers and targets the median of the peer group. In order to continue to support the Company's high-performance culture, the Company's key principles underlying the executive compensation program are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Attract and retain executives with the skills and experience needed to successfully grow the Company and create value for shareholders;

● Create an entrepreneurial culture and mindset by de-emphasizing fixed pay (primarily salary) and  focusing a significant percentage of compensation on at-risk pay elements (annual and long-term incentives); and

● Motivate and reward executives for achieving exceptional performance supportive of creating value for shareholders over the long-term.

The Compensation Committee will continue to adjust its pay practices to support these principles over time. 
CEO 2018 Compensation 
The Compensation Committee utilizes the services of an independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), to conduct an annual Executive Compensation Market Study to identify appropriate gaming-based peer companies and analyze the CEO pay level against the peers of the Company. The Committee reviews each component of cash compensation (base salary and cash bonus), long-term incentives and total direct compensation for its peers' CEOs, in relation to the Company's CEO (Mr. William Carstanjen). As discussed above, the Company's compensation philosophy is to pay at the median of its peer group, and we note that the Company's net income and market capitalization approximate the median of the selected peer companies. 
As discussed in greater detail on page 31, for fiscal year 2018, the peer group was: Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ALL); Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD); Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR); Eldorado Resorts Inc. (ERI); Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. (GLPI); Madison Square Garden Company (MSG); MGM Resorts International (MGM); Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN); Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. (PNK); Red Rock Resorts Inc. (RRR); Scientific Games Corp (SGMS); Tropicana Entertainment Inc. (TPCA); and Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN). 
The table below summarizes the 2018 peer group's target compensation data provided by FW Cook, along with Mr. Carstanjen's 2017 and 2018 compensation:

 25th Percentile (Peer  Group)    $ 1,030,000     $ 1,030,000     $ 2,060,000     $ 2,073,000     $ 5,357,000

 Carstanjen (2018 Target)    $     1,350,000  (below peer median)          $     2,025,000  (at peer median)          $     3,375,000  (below peer median)          $     4,600,000  (slightly above peer median)          $     7,975,000  (below peer median)        
[END TABLE]
To compensate Mr. Carstanjen closer to the median pay level for his peer group and with a higher weighting on long-term incentives, the Compensation Committee approved the following pay actions in the first quarter of 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Increased Mr. Carstanjen's annual base salary from $1,030,000 to $1,350,000, resulting in a base salary that  remains below the median of the peer group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Increased Mr. Carstanjen's annual target cash bonus percent from 140% to 150% of base pay, resulting in a  target bonus that is slightly above the median of the peer group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Increased Mr. Carstanjen's long-term incentives from $4,000,000 to $4,600,000. Fifty percent (50%) of the  long-term incentives are PSUs with a three-year performance period, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) are time-based RSUs with ratable vesting over three years.

As a result of these actions, Mr. Carstanjen's target total direct compensation for 2018 moved closer to, but is still below, the median of the CEO peer group as shown in the table above. 
Mr. Carstanjen became the CEO of the Company in 2014, and the performance of the Company since his assumption of the CEO role has been outstanding, with a total shareholder return of 183% and over $1 billion returned to the Company's shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over the past five years. The Company's outstanding performance is further reflected in the key business metrics summarized in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CHDN Stock Price   $ 31.77      $ 81.31        156%        26%             
 Net Income (from continuing operations) (millions)   $ 56.9      $ 182.6        221%        34%             
 Earnings Per Share (from continuing operations, diluted)   $ 1.08      $ 4.39        306%        42%

 Dividends Per Share   $ 0.333      $ 0.543        63%        13%             
[END TABLE]
In addition to the strong performance of the Company since Mr. Carstanjen became CEO, the Compensation Committee believes that other market factors also increased the market demand for executives with Mr. Carstanjen's skills and experience. For instance, in May 2018 the Supreme Court of the United States cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting, striking down a federal law that had prohibited sports betting in most states. As a result of this Supreme Court ruling and previous decisions related to internet-based gaming over the last several years, growth opportunities for gaming companies have increased and there have been new entries from across the globe into the sector. In light of these developments and Mr. Carstanjen's leadership, unique skills and proven success in the field, the Compensation Committee believes that there is high demand for executives such as Mr. Carstanjen and reasonably anticipated that there would be increased solicitation of Mr. Carstanjen for alternative employment opportunities. 
In light of the above, on October 30, 2018, the Company approved a one-time, meaningful, performance-oriented and career-focused equity award (the "7-Year Grant") to Mr. Carstanjen. 
The 7-Year Grant is in addition to participation in the Company's regular annual long-term incentive program and is sized such that it will serve as substantial incentive to keep Mr. Carstanjen focused on shareholder return and the long-term financial success of the Company. As described in more detail below, the earliest vesting date for any of the stock units awarded pursuant to the 7-Year Grant is the fourth anniversary of the grant date, and full vesting cannot occur until the seventh anniversary of the grant date. 
There are three key elements in the design of the 7-Year Grant: (1) inclusion of performance goals designed to reinforce the Company's pay for performance philosophy; (2) linkage to the Company's share price appreciation and shareholder interests, with threshold performance set above the median of the comparator group (as described below) and target performance set at the 70th percentile of the comparator group; and (3) appropriate leverage to provide a meaningful compensation opportunity while not promoting excessive risk taking. In addition, the 7-Year Grant is not eligible for full vesting until the seventh-anniversary of the grant date, thereby reinforcing the retentive aspect of this award. 
Sixty-seven (67%) of the stock units awarded were in the form of PSUs, with vesting based on the Company's relative TSR performance versus the Russell 2000 over a three-year performance period (October 30, 2018 through October 29, 2021). The award will be forfeited if the Company does not achieve threshold performance of at least 55th percentile versus the Russell 2000 during the three-year performance period. To mitigate for spot strike price volatility, the Company will use a 20-day averaging period at the beginning and end of the performance period to calculate TSR. In addition, the calculation of TSR will assume reinvestment of the dividends and exclude companies that are acquired during the performance period and treat bankruptcies as low performers. None of the shares subject to the award will vest if the Company's performance ranks below the threshold performance goal. Vesting levels for performance between performance levels will be interpolated. Notwithstanding above-target performance, vesting will be limited to 100% if the Company's TSR is negative.

2018 "Say-on-Pay" Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee monitors closely the results of the annual advisory "say-on-pay" vote, and considers such results as one of the many factors considered in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. In 2018, the Company provided shareholders a "say-on-pay" advisory vote on its executive compensation program, as disclosed in the Company's 2018 proxy statement. At the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 97% of our shareholders voting on the proposal expressed support for the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the 2018 proxy statement. The Compensation Committee considered the results of the 2018 advisory vote and also considered other factors in evaluating the Company's executive compensation programs as discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the advice of the Committee's independent compensation consultant, and did not make any changes to the executive compensation program in response to the 2018 "say-on-pay" vote. 
Role of Management and Independent Advisors 
The Compensation Committee meetings are regularly attended by the CEO, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources, who is responsible for leading some of the discussions regarding the Company's compensation programs as well as being responsible for recording the minutes of the meeting, the Vice President of Human Resources, and the General Counsel. The Compensation Committee may request the participation of management or outside consultants as it deems necessary or appropriate. The Compensation Committee regularly reports to the Board on compensation matters and annually reviews the CEO's compensation with the Board.

The Committee may also meet in executive session without any members of management, for the purpose of discussing and approving compensation for the CEO, as well as other topics. The CEO reviews the performance of, and makes recommendations to, the Compensation Committee regarding total compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers other than himself, including salary, annual bonus, and long-term incentive awards, as appropriate. Management also develops and presents to the Committee recommendations for the performance measures and targets to be used to evaluate annual performance incentives. 
After the end of each fiscal year, the Committee conducts a review of the CEO's performance. As part of this process, the CEO provides a written assessment of the Company's performance. The Committee sets the compensation of the CEO in executive session after considering its assessment of the CEO's performance, including due consideration of the CEO's written assessment of the Company's performance. Neither the CEO nor any other members of management are present during this session. 
The Committee has sole discretion, at the Company's expense, to retain and terminate independent advisors, including sole authority to approve the fees and retention terms for such advisors, if it shall determine the services of such advisors to be necessary or appropriate. Such advisors are engaged by, and report directly to, the Committee. Since March 2015, the Committee has retained FW Cook as its independent compensation consultant. The scope of the engagement of FW Cook includes:

FW Cook did not provide any services to the Company other than advising the Committee as provided above. All of the decisions with respect to the Company's executive compensation programs are made by the Committee alone and may reflect factors and considerations other than, or that may differ from, the information and recommendations provided by management or its outside advisor. The Compensation Committee assessed FW Cook's independence in light of the SEC requirements and NASDAQ listing standards and determined that FW Cook's work did not raise any conflict of interest or independence concerns. 
Factors Used to Evaluate Pay Decisions 
The Company seeks to obtain and retain the services of executives who bring the skills, experience, and motivation deemed necessary to significantly expand the scope and scale of the Company's operations. Therefore, compensation decisions for individual executives are made based on a balance of many subjective factors as evaluated by the CEO in the case of his direct reports (with Committee review and approval) and the Committee in the case of the CEO. These factors include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The scope and responsibility of the NEOs position and the perceived level of contribution;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Internal comparisons among the executives peers at the Company;

● Target annual incentive opportunities based on Companys annual goals with regard to NEOs position, as approved by the  Committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Long-term incentive opportunities driven by the perceived level of contribution expected of the executive toward achieving the  Companys growth objectives.  
[END TABLE]
Each element of compensation is evaluated independently based on the role of that component in achieving the Company's overall compensation objectives, with an emphasis on long-term incentives and retention. 
In making executive pay decisions, the Committee relies substantially on the advice and experience of its independent advisor and the CEO to evaluate the reasonableness of executive pay. The CEO does not make recommendations with respect to his own compensation. The Committee determines pay levels and practices based on the talent needs of the organization as defined by our strategy of growing and diversifying revenues and with the guidance of the Committee's independent advisor. 
Nevertheless, the Committee believes that it is important for the Company to stay competitive on compensation and the Committee, with the assistance of the Committee's independent advisor, conducts periodic reviews of compensation relative to similarly situated businesses, which can lead to adjustments in compensation and program offerings. The compensation peer group was selected to represent a reasonable match to the Company in terms of size and business characteristics. The group consists of public, similarly sized gaming companies (including traditional gaming, casinos, and internet/software gaming to reflect the Company's diverse operations), where the median net income and market capitalization approximate the Company's net income and market capitalization. The Company periodically reviews the peer group and makes adjustments, as deemed necessary, for continued appropriateness as a market reference for informing executive compensation levels. Following the sale of Big Fish, the peer group was adjusted to better reflect the Company's current mix of traditional gaming and horseracing companies. Accordingly, the following companies were (i) removed from the Company's historical peer group: Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI); Blucora Inc. (BCOR); Choice Hotels International Inc. (CHH); Electronic Arts Inc. (EA); Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU); ILG Inc. (ILG); Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (ISLE); RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK); Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO); and Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) and (ii) added to the Company's historical peer group: Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ALL); Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR); Eldorado Resorts Inc. (ERI); Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. (GLPI); Madison Square Garden Company (MSG); and Red Rock Resorts Inc. (RRR).     
It is the opinion of the Committee that the pay decisions made by the Committee are reasonable relative to pay provided to executives at other similar public companies, based on the Committee's experience, the performance expectations established for each element of pay, and consultation with the Committee's independent advisor.

Components of Compensation 
During 2018, the Company used multiple components to provide an overall compensation and benefits package designed to attract and retain the needed level of executive talent for the Company and to incentivize their performance. The following table sets forth the principal compensation elements of the Company's 2018 executive compensation program and how each element fits into the Company's overall compensation program and is supportive of the Company's executive compensation objectives.

Base Salary 
The Committee's philosophy is that base salaries should meet the objectives of attracting and retaining the executive talent needed to grow the business and create shareholder value. Therefore, the Committee establishes base salaries for new hires based on the advice of management and its independent advisor regarding reasonable market pay practices, and comparisons with the executive's peers at the Company. Upon promotion or other adjustment of responsibilities, executives receive base pay increases that are intended to be commensurate with their new role or responsibilities and the pay levels for colleagues at similar levels in the organization and market pay practices, with more modest rates of increase thereafter. 
In 2018, the following adjustments were made to the base salaries for the Company's NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 William C. Carstanjen   Chief Executive Officer      1,030,000        31.1%      +320,000        1,350,000

Similar peer group market analyses were performed for the President & COO and CFO positions, and adjustments were made to Mr. Mudd's and  Ms. Dall's salaries in response to those analyses. Consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy, adjustments were made to target the median compensation levels among our peer group.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Annual Incentive Plan 
Bonus awards or incentive compensation paid with respect to 2018 were determined by the Committee per the terms of the 2013 Executive Annual Incentive Plan ("EAIP"). Pursuant to the EAIP, the Committee established performance goals for the Company and bonus opportunities for the 2018 performance year. In analyzing proposed awards against target and maximum payouts, the Committee used the goals as its roadmap to determine whether to issue awards above, at, or below each NEO's target award. As it has done historically, the Committee sets performance goals for 2018, based upon a comprehensive assessment of the Company against its long-term strategic goals and its ability to achieve said goals with its current leadership team and key employees. Therefore, individual performance by the Company's NEOs (as measured by various factors, including, but not limited to, continued growth and diversification of the Company's asset portfolio through acquisitions, customer and employee satisfaction, and the completion of certain specified legislative and regulatory outcomes), and unit performance led by some of the Company's key employees (as measured by, among other things,

2018 Performance Goals. For 2018, the Committee set the following goals for the EAIP. These goals were used to assess the NEOs' performance and determine EAIP payouts as disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 41. The Committee, in setting the goals, considered the challenges to the Company; however, each goal was deemed achievable, but requiring a superior level of performance. The goals are expressed generally as follows, with no specific weighting attributed to any one goal: 
Overall

The Compensation Committee approves the target and maximum incentive levels, after considering recommendations from the CEO for each NEO (except the CEO), at the beginning of each year. The Committee independently evaluates and approves the target and maximum incentive levels for the CEO at the beginning of each year. During 2018, the target and maximum awards assigned to the CEO and the other NEOs were as follows:

(1)  As discussed above in the "CEO 2018 Compensation" section on pages 27-29, Mr. Carstanjen's target  incentive award as a percentage of salary was adjusted in 2018 in response to the peer group compensation analysis performed by the Company's compensation consultant, FW Cook. Similar peer group market analyses were performed for the other NEO  positions, including the CFO, and adjustments were made to Ms. Dall's target incentive award as a percentage of salary in response to those analyses. Consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy, adjustments were made to  target the median compensation levels among our peer group.  
[END TABLE]
2018 Performance Results. In determining the payouts, the Compensation Committee exercises its discretion to determine whether to payout at, above, or below the target opportunities based upon its review of the outcomes evaluated against Company and individual performance. The Compensation Committee established a minimum corporate Adjusted EBITDA performance threshold for 2018 of $185 million, which was required to be achieved before any incentives were eligible to be paid under the EAIP for 2018. The Compensation Committee certified that actual Adjusted EBITDA for compensation purposes for 2018 exceeded this threshold and that executives were eligible for payouts under the EAIP for 2018. 
In evaluating 2018 performance, the Compensation Committee considered (i) revenue from continuing operations ($1.0 billion, an increase of 14%), net income from continuing operations ($182.6 million, an increase of 49%), diluted net income per share from continuing operations ($4.39, an increase of 72%), and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations ($328.8, an increase of 15%), each as compared to 2017; (ii) record all sources handle for Kentucky Derby and Oaks week of $311.2 million, up 9% compared to 2017; (iii) strong organic growth from our Calder, Riverwalk, Oxford, Fair Grounds Slots and Video Poker, and Harlow's casino properties; (iv) capital expenditures of $149 million; and (v) the growth of TwinSpires.com handle to $1.4 billion, up 8% compared to 2017. The Compensation Committee determined that these achievements contributed to benefits being realized by the Company's shareholders. 
The amounts earned by the NEOs for 2018 under the EAIP are reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 41 in the column labeled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." As noted above, the Company exhibited strong overall financial performance in 2018. The NEOs were viewed by the Committee to be the primary parties responsible for the actual performance relative to the performance goals established with respect to 2018. The Compensation Committee, after considering the Company's overall performance, awarded the NEOs EAIP awards as shown in the table on page 41. As such, the NEOs were awarded an EAIP award at the following percentage of their target incentive award: Mr. Carstanjen 148% ($3,000,000), Mr. Mudd 167% ($1,250,000), Ms. Dall 146% ($775,000), and Mr. Miller 135% ($325,700). The awards for Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd, Ms. Dall, and Mr. Miller were made pursuant to the EAIP and as a reward for the NEOs respective roles in driving performance during the period ending December 31, 2018. 
2019 Executive Annual Incentive Plan 
For 2019, the Company implemented a newly designed EAIP for the NEOs, whereby the majority of the annual incentive will be formulaically based on achievement to pre-established goals with defined weightings. Under this design, 75% of the 2019 EAIP award will be determined formulaically, based on corporate or business unit Adjusted EBITDA performance, and the remaining 25% will vest based on the attainment of strategic and individual goals established for each NEO, with payouts under the 2019 EAIP ranging from 0% to 200% of target.

Long-Term Incentives 
The objective of the Company's long-term incentive compensation program is to support the entrepreneurial mindset desired of management by the Board of Directors by providing an opportunity to earn significant equity in the Company for achieving significant performance improvements. 
In 2015, the Compensation Committee approved the adoption of the Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "ELTI Plan"), pursuant to which the NEOs may earn variable equity payouts based upon the Company achieving certain key performance metrics. The purpose of the ELTI Plan is to provide participants with a long-term incentive program that is market-competitive and provides long-term incentives on a regular, predictable, and annual basis. Eligible participants (as determined by the Committee) may be members of the Company's senior executive team and/or such other executives and key contributors as the Committee may designate from time to time. As and to the extent determined by the Committee as part of the annual compensation planning process for participants, the CEO will participate in the ELTI Plan at a rate determined by the Committee. No individual will have an automatic right to participate in the ELTI Plan. A summary of the 2018 terms and applicable award opportunities, granted by the Committee to the NEOs, is provided below. 
During the beginning of 2018, the CEO recommended employees (other than with respect to himself) to the Committee for participation in the ELTI Plan for 2018 and their respective specific levels of proposed participation. Awards granted to eligible employees under the ELTI Plan may be in the form of restricted share units ("RSUs"), performance share units ("PSUs"), or both. To pursue the key objective of linking executive compensation with Company performance, the Committee aimed to deliver at least 50% of the 2018 awards as PSUs. 
The Committee approved the 2018 RSU awards on February 15, 2018, and the PSU awards (for the 36-month performance period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020) under the ELTI Plan on March 26, 2018. The 2018 awards are as follows:

(1)  The market value of the time-vesting RSUs, in the above table, was calculated utilizing the closing price of CHDN as of  February 15, 2018 multiplied by the total number of time-vesting RSUs granted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The grant date fair value for the PSUs in the above table was calculated based on the probable achievement of the  performance goals and a Monte-Carlo simulation model, which factors in the value of the relative TSR modifier (defined below) that is applied to the award before the share-based payment vests. The PSUs, in the above table, represent the target  opportunity, and corresponding fair value, available to the grantees should the Company achieve the pre-determined performance metrics. Actual shares that vest pursuant to the PSUs may be more or less given  the performance on the selected metrics discussed below.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to the PSU awards in the table above, performance will be based on the following three Performance Measures during the 36-month period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 (the "Performance Period"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1)  Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") (50% weight).  Adjusted EBITDA during the Performance Period relative to the goals set for such measurement period, will be derived from the Company's consolidated financial statements with adjustments as described further below;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2)  Cash Flow Metric ("Cash Flow Metric") (50% weight). Cumulative Cash Flow (i.e. the sum of the free cash  flows from the annual periods ending December 31 of each of 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, where the Cash Flow Metric goals are set at the beginning of each of those three periods) will also be derived from the Company's consolidated  financial statements with adjustments as described further below; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3)  Relative Total Shareholder Return Modifier ("TSR"). The Company's TSR modifier will be determined  by ranking the return on the Company's shares against those of the companies in the Russell 2000 index (the "Index"), in each case, over the Performance Period. The Company's TSR will be calculated based upon the Company's  relative placement against the Index over the Performance Period. The PSU awards determined by the Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow

The maximum number of PSUs that can be earned for the Performance Period is 250% of target. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee will review performance achieved on each pre-established Performance Measure. The goals are intended to be challenging, but achievable with strong management performance. The payout for each Performance Measure will be determined by a payout curve, as achievement that lies in between two goals will be interpolated. 
With respect to the RSU awards, the RSUs vest in one third (1/3) increments on each of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively, generally subject to the executive's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The Company intends to settle the vested RSUs in shares of Company common stock. 
With respect to the performance period and related PSU awards under the ELTI Plan for January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, the actual performance was certified by the Compensation Committee in its February 2019 meeting (with a TSR at 83%, in the top 17% of the Russell 2000 over the performance period) as set forth below, with settlement of the PSUs occurring on February 27, 2019:

During 2016, the Company changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude changes in Big Fish deferred revenue for financial reporting purposes. For compensation purposes, Adjusted EBITDA targets under the 2016 awards were set prior to this change and, therefore, performance for these awards will be evaluated based on the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow in place at the time of the establishment of the awards, per below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Adjusted EBITDAas defined in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. For compensation purposes, the Committee has determined it is appropriate to include the gain on the sale of Big Fish segment in 2018 and  gain on sale of Calder land sale in 2016, both of which were pursuant to the long-term strategic plan for the Company, in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for compensation purposes.

● Cash Flow MetricThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Updated No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash on January 1, 2018, which requires the statement of cash flows to explain the change during the period of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash. Due to the fact this  accounting change was adopted subsequent to the cash flow metric targets established, the Company has included the change in restricted cash in the cash flow from operating activities. Therefore, our cash flow metric is defined as Cash Flows from  Operating Activities in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, not including the  impact from the change in restricted cash, plus distributions of capital from equity investments less capital maintenance expenditures. For compensation purposes, the Committee has determined it is appropriate to include the net cash from sale of  properties that are part of the long-term strategic plan for the Company, such as the Calder land sale, in the calculation of the cash flow metric.

7-Year Performance-Based Equity Grant 
As described in detail in the "CEO 2018 Compensation" section above, on October 30, 2018, the Company approved a special, meaningful, equity award (the "7-Year Grant") to Mr. Carstanjen. On that same day, the Company also approved a 7-Year Grant to Mr. Mudd. The 7-Year Grants were awarded to Messrs. Carstanjen and Mudd in light of the legalization of sports betting, the leadership and unique skills of these executives, and the reasonable anticipation that there would be increased solicitation of Messrs. Carstanjen and Mudd for alternative employment opportunities. The 7-Year Grant is in addition to participation in the Company's regular annual long-term incentive program and is sized such that it will serve as substantial incentive to retain both executives over the seven-year vesting period and keep both executives focused on the long-term financial and stock price success of the Company. 
As previously described, there are three key elements in the design of the 7-Year Grant: (1) inclusion of robust performance goals designed to reinforce the Company's pay for performance philosophy; (2) linkage to the Company's share price appreciation and shareholder interests; and (3) appropriate leverage to provide a meaningful compensation opportunity while not promoting excessive risk taking. In addition, the 7-Year Grant is not eligible for full vesting until the seventh-anniversary of the grant date, thereby reinforcing the retentive aspect of this award. 
As discussed in greater detail above, sixty-seven percent (67%) of the stock units awarded were in the form of PSUs, with vesting based on the Company's relative TSR performance versus the Russell 2000 over a three-year performance period (October 30, 2018 through October 29, 2021), with vesting occurring thereafter in 25% annual increments over four years beginning on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, totaling seven years to be fully vested. Mr. Carstanjen was awarded 127,587 PSUs valued at $8,040,107 based on a Monte Carlo valuation on October 30, 2018. Mr. Mudd was awarded 79,743 PSUs valued at $5,025,138, based on a Monte Carlo valuation on October 30, 2018. 
The remaining thirty-three percent (33%) of the stock units awarded were in the form of service-based RSUs, which vest in 25% annual increments over four years beginning on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, totaling seven years to be fully vested. Mr. Carstanjen and Mr. Mudd were awarded 48,711 time-based RSUs (grant date fair value of $3,960,204) and 30,444 time-based RSUs (grant date fair value of $2,475,097), respectively.

Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our Board of Directors has adopted minimum stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers. The principal objective of the guidelines is to enhance the linkage between the interests of shareholders and our executive officers by requiring a meaningful, minimum level of stock ownership. The current guidelines provide that, within five (5) years of becoming subject to the stock ownership guidelines, our CEO should own shares valued at an amount equal to six times (6x) his base salary, our COO should own shares valued at an amount equal to four times (4x) his base salary, and our CFO and other executive officers should own shares valued at an amount equal to three times (3x) the executive's base salary. 
In 2018, each NEO met or exceeded the guidelines:

Deferred Compensation and Other Benefits 
The Company's philosophy is to provide retirement and savings benefits to executives which are commonly provided by other public companies. The benefits available to executives include: 
401(k). The Company maintains a 401(k) Retirement Plan, which is a profit sharing plan that is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The 401(k) Retirement Plan allows all employees who meet the eligibility requirements to become participants. Participants may make salary deferral contributions pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code up to limits prescribed by the plan and the Code. The Company makes matching contributions with respect to such salary deferrals at a rate of 100% on the first 3% of compensation deferred and 50% on deferrals in excess of 3% of compensation deferred but no more than 5% of compensation deferred. Salary deferral contributions and matching contributions are fully vested at all times. Participants are allowed to direct investment of their accounts under the 401(k) Retirement Plan into as many as 29 investment options. All assets of the 401(k) Retirement Plan are held in a trust that is intended to be qualified under Section 501 of the Code. 
Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company also maintains a Deferred Compensation Plan for select executives. The purpose of the plan is to provide eligible executives of the Company an opportunity to defer to a future date the receipt of base salary and bonus compensation for services and to receive matching contributions in similar fashion as provided by the Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan for any base salary and bonus deferred beyond the limits imposed by the IRS for that plan. The Committee believes that a Deferred Compensation Plan is a typical benefit for executives at companies similar to the Company and is necessary to attract and retain executive talent. 
For purposes of determining earnings under the Deferred Compensation Plan, various hypothetical investment alternatives consistent with those offered under the Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan are available. The current hypothetical investments available under the Deferred Compensation Plan consist of 38 investment return options for determining the rate of return to be credited on participant deferrals. Participants are allowed to choose among these investment return options in order to direct the hypothetical investments used to determine earnings under the Plan. 
Life insurance contracts have been purchased by the Company to provide some or all of the benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Other details regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan can be found in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table, on page 47, and the accompanying narrative below.

Allowances and Other Benefits. The Company's standard, non-cash executive benefits are Company-paid premiums on executive term life insurance and an optional supplemental long-term disability income plan for Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd, Ms. Dall, and Mr. Miller. These plans provide benefits which are similar to those provided to eligible employees, but extend the benefit levels to be appropriate to the income of the executive officers. 
For Company executives, the Company may reimburse spouse's travel expenses for travel with the executive on Company business on a case-by-case basis. 
Severance Benefits. The Compensation Committee believes that arrangements that provide benefits upon termination or a change in control of the Company support the goals of attracting and retaining qualified executives. Such benefits include clarifying the terms of employment and reducing the risks to the executive where the executive believes that either the Company may undergo a merger or be acquired or where the Company has tasked the executive to develop new markets or lines of business for the Company. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that such agreements align the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders if a qualified offer to acquire the Company is made, in that each of the executives would likely be aware of or involved in any such negotiation and it is to the benefit of shareholders to have the executives negotiating in the best interests of the Company without regard to their personal financial interests. In 2014, the Compensation Committee, in lieu of negotiating individual severance agreements with each executive, adopted a form Executive Change in Control, Severance and Indemnity Agreement (the "2014 Change in Control Agreement"). William C. Carstanjen, William E. Mudd, and Marcia A. Dall each executed a 2014 Change in Control Agreement. The 2014 Change in Control Agreements, at the time of execution, became immediately effective and each of Mr. Carstanjen's and Mr. Mudd's previously executed employment agreement terminated. In 2018, Mr. Carstanjen and Mr. Mudd each executed updated Change in Control Agreements which became immediately effective upon execution, and Mr. Carstanjen's and Mr. Mudd's 2014 Change in Control Agreements terminated. A summary of each of the Change in Control Agreements in effect for the Company's Named Executive Officers is provided below. 
The Change in Control Agreement executed by Mr. Carstanjen and Mr. Mudd in 2018 provides that, subject to the Company receiving a general release of claims from the executive, in the event the executive's employment is terminated (i) by the Company other than for "Cause" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), "Disability" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) or death or (ii) by the executive for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), the executive will be entitled to receive (a) an amount in cash equal to, in the case of Mr. Carstanjen, 2 times and, in the case of Mr. Mudd, 1.5 times the sum of (x) the executive's annual base salary and (y) the amount of the executive's annual target bonus for the year in which the Executive was terminated, and (b) a lump sum amount equal to the prorated in-cycle bonus of executive's target bonus for the year in which the executive's termination of employment occurs. In the event the termination occurs within the 2-year period following a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), Mr. Mudd's severance multiple will increase to 2x. All equity-based awards in effect at the time of termination for the aforementioned reasons shall remain governed by the applicable plan or award agreement. 
The 2014 Change in Control Agreement provides that, subject to the Company receiving a general release of claims from Ms. Dall, in the event Ms. Dall's employment is terminated (i) by the Company, other than for "Cause" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), "Disability" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), or death, or (ii) by Ms. Dall for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), Ms. Dall will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) Ms. Dall's annual base salary and (b) the amount of Ms. Dall's annual target bonus for the year in which Ms. Dall was terminated. In the event the termination occurs within the 2-year period following a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement), the amount shall be 2.0 times the sum of (a) and (b) above. All equity-based awards in effect at the time of termination for the aforementioned reasons shall remain governed by the applicable plan or award agreement. 
Mr. Miller has not executed a Change in Control Agreement, so Mr. Miller's severance benefits would be governed by the Company's Executive Severance Policy. 
The Change in Control Agreements do not provide for any tax gross-ups for excise taxes payable following a Change in Control.

(1)  In accordance with the SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, the amounts shown in 2018 for stock awards (other than  with respect to Mr. Thelen) represent the grant date fair value of such awards determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC  Topic 718"), but disregarding the estimate of forfeitures, in connection with service-based RSUs and PSUs granted pursuant to the ELTI Plan to each of our participating NEOs in 2018. The amounts included in the Stock Awards column for the PSUs  granted during 2018 are calculated based on the probable satisfaction of the performance conditions for such awards as of the date of grant. Assuming the highest level of performance is achieved for the 2018 PSUs subject to the Adjusted EBITDA and  Cash Flow metrics, the maximum value of such PSUs at the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Carstanjen—$5,750,278; Mr. Mudd—$2,250,189; Ms. Dall—$1,375,013; and Mr. Miller—$750,063. Under FASB ASC Topic 718,  the TSR vesting condition related to the 7-Year Grant is considered a market condition and not a performance condition. Accordingly, there is no grant date fair value below or in excess of the amount reflected  in the table above for Messrs. Carstanjen and Mudd that could be calculated and disclosed based on achievement of the underlying market condition. In the case of Mr. Thelen, the amounts reported for 2018 represent the incremental fair value  associated with the termination and settlement of Mr. Thelen's outstanding RSU and PSU agreements, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," in connection with  the sale of Big Fish and Mr. Thelen's separation from the Company, Mr. Thelen's RSU and PSU agreements were modified to provide for vesting and settlement on the date of Mr. Thelen's separation from the Company. See  Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in calculating the amounts  reported for 2018.  
[END TABLE]

(2)  Amounts in this column represent payments for performance under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan ("EAIP").  Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd, Ms. Dall, and Mr. Miller received their 2018 EAIP awards in February 2019. Typically, payments for each year shown are made by March 15 of the following year.

(5)  To demonstrate the year-over-year changes in the regular components of the Company's NEO compensation program for  Messrs. Carstanjen and Mudd, we have included this column to show total compensation without the 7-Year Grant, which represented a one-time, meaningful,  performance-oriented and career-focused equity award granted to each. The amounts reported in this column are calculated by subtracting from 2018 total compensation, as calculated in accordance with the SEC executive compensation disclosure rules,  the grant date fair value of the PSUs and RSUs awarded under the 7-Year Grant. The amounts reported in this column differ from, and are not a substitute for, the amounts reported in the "Total"  column of this table.

The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table above shows information about the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Executive officers and other executives may defer receipt of all or part of their cash compensation under this plan. The plan operates in a similar manner as the Company's 401(k) plan, whereby participants can manage their self-directed accounts to allocate balances among various investment alternatives, which determine gains or losses under the plan. A company match is provided for amounts deferred above the qualified plan limits. The plan is unfunded for ERISA purposes and subject to forfeiture in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy by the Company. Participants can elect to receive their deferred compensation balance (i) upon termination of employment through a lump sum payment or (ii) while employed by the Company provided that the initial distribution date is at least five (5) years from the initial participation date, in which case distributions may be made on a monthly basis or in a lump sum.

Non-Solicit Provisions 
Mr. Carstanjen, Mr. Mudd and Ms. Dall (the "Key Executives") each entered into an Executive Change in Control, Severance and Indemnity Agreement (the "Change in Control Agreements") with the Company, replacing all previously executed employment agreements, if any, which were mutually terminated by the Company and each Key Executive. Pursuant to each of these agreements, each Key Executive is subject to a two-year non-solicitation period after the termination of their employment with the Company for any reason, during which they may not solicit any employee of the Company to leave employment with the Company or solicit any customer of the Company for the purpose of engaging in business with them that competes with the business engaged in by the Company. 
Severance Benefits 
The Change in Control Agreements, executed by the Key Executives, provide for the following principal severance provisions upon termination by the Company without cause or by the executive upon constructive termination or for good reason (as defined in each agreement): 
Mr. Carstanjen and Mr. Mudd. The Change in Control Agreement executed by Mr. Carstanjen and Mr. Mudd in 2018 provides that, upon termination by the Company without cause or by the executive upon constructive termination or for good reason, the executive will be entitled to receive (a) an amount in cash equal to, in the case of Mr. Carstanjen, 2 times and, in the case of Mr. Mudd, 1.5 times the sum of (x) the executive's annual base salary and (y) the amount of the executive's annual target bonus for the year in which the Executive was terminated, (b) a lump sum amount equal to the prorated in-cycle bonus of executive's target bonus for the year in which the executive's termination of employment occurs; (c) treatment of all equity-based awards per the terms of the applicable plan, award or agreement; and (d) a lump sum cash payment equal to the total premiums for medical, dental and vision benefits for a three-month period. 
Ms. Dall. The Change in Control Agreement executed by Ms. Dall provides that, upon termination by the Company without cause or by Ms. Dall upon constructive termination or for good reason, Ms. Dall will be entitled to receive (a) an amount in cash equal to 1.5 times the sum of (x) Ms. Dall's annual base salary and (y) the amount of Ms. Dall's annual target bonus for the year in which the Ms. Dall was terminated; (b) treatment of all equity-based awards per the terms of the applicable plan, award or agreement; and (c) a lump sum cash payment equal to the total premiums for medical, dental and vision benefits for a three-month period. 
Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller has not executed a Change in Control Agreement, so Mr. Miller's severance benefits would be governed by the Company's Executive Severance Policy. Per that policy, upon termination by the Company as a result of an elimination of his position or duties, Mr. Miller will be entitled to receive (a) three (3) weeks of salary per year of service, up to a limit of 26 weeks (which Mr. Miller has reached); (b) a transition allowance of $10,000; (c) earned but unpaid incentive plan bonuses; (d) a prorated target bonus for the year of termination; (e) any accrued but unpaid salary and accrued but unused personal time off; and (f) treatment of all equity-based awards per the terms of the applicable plan, award or agreement. 
Mr. Thelen. As part of the Separation Agreement and Release entered into on January 9, 2018 by and among the Company, Big Fish, and Paul Thelen, Mr. Thelen became entitled to the following severance benefits: (a) twelve months of salary continuation, equal to $424,360 in the aggregate; (b) twelve months of COBRA subsidy, equal to $23,820 in the aggregate; and (c) Mr. Thelen's target bonus for the 2017 fiscal year under the Churchill Downs Incorporated Executive Annual Incentive Plan, equal to a gross amount of $339,448. The Company also terminated Mr. Thelen's RSU agreements and PSU agreements and paid out 67,431 shares to Mr. Thelen as of the Closing Date (equal to $5,364,136 based on the Company's closing stock price of $79.55 on the date of Mr. Thelen's separation), less 26,517 shares withheld for taxes. 
Change in Control Benefits. The current agreements for the Key Executives also provide for the following change in control provisions: if the executive is terminated within two years following a change in control, the Key Executive will receive severance as provided above, except that the salary and bonus severance multiple shall in each case be 2x. 
In the event that any or all payments to any of the Key Executives are subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such payments shall be reduced to one dollar ($1) below the maximum amount of payments that will not be subject to such tax; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in the event the total payments to a Key Executive, on an after-tax basis, would exceed the after-tax benefits to the Key Executive if such limitation applied. The Key Executive shall bear the expense of any and all excise taxes due on any payments that are deemed to be "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code.

PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total compensation of Mr. Carstanjen, our Chief Executive Officer. To understand this disclosure, we think it is important to give context to our operations. Our business is seasonal and relies heavily on seasonal, part-time and hourly workers. In addition, our gaming business operation also employs many part time hourly employees. In total, approximately 78.5% of our workforce is hourly employees. 
We strive to create a compensation program that is competitive in terms of both the position and the geographic location in which the employee is located. Accordingly, our pay structures vary among employees based on position and geographic location. 
Identification of Median Employee 
In 2017, we selected December 15, 2017 as the date to identify our median employee. For 2018, we elected to use December 21, 2018 as the date on which to determine our median employee. This date was chosen because it followed the closing and administrative processing of the 2018 fall race meets at both Churchill Downs Racetrack and Arlington Park Racecourse, so seasonal employees utilized only during the race meets (i.e., not during the majority of the year) and not viewed as representative of our general employee base were no longer on the payroll. As of December 21, 2018, we had approximately 4,075 employees. For purposes of identifying the median employee, we ran a report for all year-to-date taxable compensation for employees as of the selection date, and sorted by the total compensation. 
Using this methodology, we determined our median employee was a full-time, hourly employee with an annual total compensation of $22,960. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee's compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as required pursuant to SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table with respect to each of the named executive officers. 
CEO Total Compensation 
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, on October 30, 2018, Mr. Carstanjen received a 7-Year Grant comprised of RSUs and PSUs that will not begin to vest until the fourth anniversary of the grant date (October 30, 2022) and will not fully vest until the seventh anniversary of the grant date (October 30, 2025). Approximately 67% of the 7-Year Grant was in the form of PSUs (127,587 PSUs valued at $8,040,107 based on a Monte Carlo valuation on October 30, 2018) that are based on relative total shareholder return for the 3-year performance period of October 30, 2018 through October 29, 2021. If earned, these PSUs will vest in 25% annual increments over four years beginning on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, totaling seven years to be fully vested, assuming continued employment. 
The remaining 33% of the 7-Year Grant is in the form of time-based restricted shares (48,711 RSUs with a grant date fair value of $3,960,204) that will vest in 25% annual increments over four years beginning on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, totaling seven years to be fully vested, assuming continued employment. 
For purposes of the Pay Ratio, Mr. Carstanjen's annual total compensation is presented in the table below with and without the 7-Year Grant. We are providing a supplemental Pay Ratio excluding the 7-Year Grant as that grant is not viewed as representative our annual compensation program. The Pay Ratio calculated excluding the 7-Year Grant should not be viewed as a substitute for the Pay Ratio calculated based on the Total Compensation reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The equity compensation plans of the Company which have been approved by the shareholders of the Company and pursuant to  which equity securities are authorized for issuance are the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Stock Purchase Plan") and the Churchill Downs Incorporated 2016 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan ("2016  Plan").  
[END TABLE]

(3)  Includes 321,657 PSUs and 219,771 RSUs that were outstanding on December 31, 2018 under the 2016 Plan. For purposes  of this table, we have included the number of shares issuable under outstanding PSUs assuming performance targets are achieved. Please see the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement for further information  regarding the 2018 PSUs, including performance metrics applicable to such awards.

(4)  Because each participant in the Stock Purchase Plan has one option each plan year and that option consists of the number  of shares which can be purchased, through exercise, at the end of the plan year using compensation deductions made throughout the plan year, no outstanding options, warrants or rights for a specific number of the Company's securities to be  issued upon exercise existed at December 31, 2018 and, therefore, none are included in this total for the Stock Purchase Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  Of this total, as of December 31, 2018, 620,835 shares of Common Stock of the Company remained available for future  issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan and 1,525,006 shares of Common Stock of the Company remained available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan. Stock awards under the 2016 Plan will be counted against the maximum number of shares as to which  stock awards may be granted on a ratio of 1-to-1.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
The Company has adopted written policies and procedures for identifying and approving or ratifying related person transactions. The policies and procedures cover all related person transactions required to be disclosed under Item 404 (a) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee is responsible for applying the policies and procedures. In evaluating related person transactions, the Audit Committee considers all factors it deems appropriate, including without limitation, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction, and whether products or services of a similar nature, quantity, or quality are readily available from alternative sources. 
Directors of the Company may from time to time own or have interests in horses racing at the Company's tracks. All such races are conducted, as applicable, under the regulations of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, the Illinois Racing Board, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering, the Louisiana State Racing Commission, the Ohio State Racing Commission, the Maryland Racing Commission, and the Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commission, and no director receives any extra or special benefit with regard to having his or her horses selected to run in races or in connection with the actual running of races. 
In its ordinary course of business, the Company may enter into transactions with certain of its officers and directors for the sale of personal seat licenses and suite accommodations at its racetracks, and tickets for its live racing events. The Company believes that each such transaction has been on terms no less favorable for the Company than could have been obtained in a transaction with a third party and no such person received any extra or special benefit in connection with such transactions. 
On March 6, 2019, The Duchossois Group ("TDG"), through one of its affiliate companies participated in a mezzanine debt financing transaction entered into by Midwest Gaming Holdings, LLC ("MGH"), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company and the parent company of the entity that owns and operates Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois (the "Mezzanine Transaction"). The Mezzanine Transaction involves a $200 million term loan facility for MGH as the borrower and bears interest at LIBOR plus 6.50%, subject to certain exceptions. TDG will acquire $20 million of the term loan via a syndication from the Mezzanine Lender, Canyon Partners. The Company has been advised that TDG's participation in the Mezzanine Transaction is on the same terms and conditions as the other participants in the facility. Our director, Richard Duchossois (who is retiring from the Board effective at the Annual Meeting), and his son Craig Duchossois (who retired from the Board effective April 24, 2018), are equity owners in TDG. 
Other than as described above, since January 1, 2018, no transaction was identified as a related party transaction.

CHURCHILL DOWNS INCORPORATED AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The following is the report of the Company's Audit Committee (the "Committee"), which currently consists of four directors, each of whom has been determined by the Board of Directors (the "Board") to meet the current standards of the SEC and the Nasdaq exchange to be considered an "independent director." The Board has also determined that two members, Daniel P. Harrington and Karole F. Lloyd, are "audit committee financial experts" as defined by the SEC. 
The Committee has an Audit Committee Charter (the "Charter"), which was amended, restated and approved by the Board on February 26, 2019. The Charter sets forth certain responsibilities of the Committee, which include oversight of the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, the systems of internal controls over financial reporting which management has established, the independence and performance of the Company's internal and independent auditors, the Company's compliance with financial, accounting, legal and regulatory requirements, and the effectiveness of the Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") function. The Committee reviews the work of the Company's management, the internal audit staff and the independent auditors on behalf of the Board. 
Specifically, the Committee:

[BEGIN TABLE]
● Reviewed and approved the 2018 audit and non-audit services and related fees  provided by the independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The non-audit services approved by the Audit Committee were also reviewed to ensure compatibility with maintaining the  auditors independence.

MULTIPLE SHAREHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Proxy Statement or Notice addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. 
At this time, one or more brokers with accountholders who are Company shareholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. A single Proxy Statement or Notice will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholder. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Proxy Statement or Notice, please notify your broker. You may direct your written request for a copy of the Proxy Statement or Notice to Churchill Downs Incorporated, Attn: Paula Chumbley, 600 N. Hurstbourne Parkway, Ste. 400, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, or at (502) 636-4400. If your broker is not currently "householding" (i.e., you received multiple copies of the Company's Proxy Statement or Notice), and you would like to request delivery of a single copy, you should contact your broker.

Any shareholder proposal that may be included in the Board of Directors' Proxy Statement and proxy for presentation at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2020 must be received by the Company at the principal executive office at 600 N. Hurstbourne Parkway, Ste. 400, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, Attention of the Secretary, no later than November 14, 2019. Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, proposals of shareholders intended to be presented at the Company's 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, but not included in the Proxy Statement, must be received by the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. Accordingly, any shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company must be received in writing by the Company at its principal executive offices no later than January 24, 2020, and no sooner than December 25, 2019.
