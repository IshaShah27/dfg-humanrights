The Company has made arrangements for intermediaries to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the Common Shares held of record by those intermediaries and the Company may reimburse the intermediaries for reasonable fees and disbursements incurred by them in so doing.

GENERAL PROXY INFORMATION
Revocability of Proxies
In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a registered shareholder who has given a proxy may revoke it by either:
(a)
executing a proxy bearing a later date; or
(b)
executing a valid notice of revocation, either of the foregoing to be executed by the registered shareholder or the shareholder's authorized attorney in writing, or, if the shareholder is a company, under its corporate seal by an officer or attorney duly authorized, and by depositing the Proxy bearing a later date with Computershare Investor Services Inc., or at the address of the registered office of the Company at 700 - 401 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6B 5A1, at any time up to and including the last business day that precedes the day of the Meeting or, if the Meeting is adjourned, the date that precedes any reconvening thereof, or to the chair of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or any reconvening thereof, or in any other manner provided by law; or
(c)
by the registered shareholder personally attending the Meeting and voting the registered shareholder's Common Shares.
A revocation of a proxy will not affect a matter on which a vote is taken before the revocation.
Appointment of Proxyholders
A shareholder entitled to vote at the Meeting may, by means of a proxy, appoint a proxyholder or one or more alternate proxyholders, who need not be Shareholders, to attend and act at the Meeting for the shareholder on the shareholder's behalf.
The individuals named in the accompanying form of proxy (the "Proxy") are directors and/or officers of the Company (the "Management Designees").  If you are a shareholder entitled to vote at the Meeting, you have the right to appoint a person, who need not be a shareholder, to attend and act for you and on your behalf at the Meeting other than either of the Management Designees. You may do so either by inserting the name of that other person in the blank space provided in the Proxy or by completing and delivering another suitable form of proxy.
A proxy will not be valid unless the completed, signed and dated form of proxy is delivered to the office of Computershare Investor Services Inc., at 8th Floor, 100 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2Y1, or by fax within North America to 1-866-249-7775 and outside North America to (416) 263-9524, or by telephone to 1-866-732-VOTE (8683) Toll Free or internet at www.investorvote.com, not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) before the Meeting or the adjournment thereof at which the Proxy is to be used.
Exercise of Discretion
The Management Designees named in the Proxy will vote or withhold from voting the shares represented thereby in accordance with the instructions of the shareholder on any ballot that may be called for.  The Proxy will confer discretionary authority on the nominees named therein with respect to:
(a)
each matter or group of matters identified therein for which a choice is not specified other than the appointment of an auditor and the election of directors,
(b)
any amendment to or variation of any matter identified therein, and
(c)
any other matter that properly comes before the Meeting.
In respect of a matter for which a choice is not specified in the Proxy, the Management Designees will vote the Common Shares represented by the Proxy at their own discretion for the approval of such matter.
As of the date of this Information Circular, management of the Company knows of no amendment, variation or other matter that may come before the Meeting, but if any amendment, variation or other matter properly comes before the Meeting, each Management Designee intends to vote thereon in accordance with the Management Designee's best judgment.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Proxy Voting Options
If you are a registered Shareholder, you may elect to submit a proxy in order to vote whether or not you are able to attend the Meeting in person.  In order to vote by mail, you must complete, date and sign the Proxy and return it to the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services Inc., at 8th Floor, 100 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5J 2Y1, or by fax within North America to 1-866-249-7775 and outside North America to (416) 263-9524, or by telephone to 1-866-732-VOTE (8683) Toll Free or internet at www.investorvote.com, at any time up to and including 9:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) on February 6, 2019.
Advice to Beneficial Holders of Common Shares
The information set forth in this section is of significant importance to many Shareholders, as a substantial number of Shareholders do not hold Common Shares in their own name.  Beneficial Shareholders should note that only Proxies deposited by Shareholders whose names appear on the records of the Company as the registered holders of Common Shares can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting.
If Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to a shareholder by a broker, then in almost all cases those Common Shares will not be registered in the shareholder's name on the records of the Company.  Such Common Shares will more likely be registered under the names of the shareholder's broker or an agent of that broker.  In the United States, the vast majority of such shares are registered under the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for The Depositary Trust Company (which acts as depositary for many U.S. brokerage firms and custodian banks), and in Canada under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited, which acts as nominee for many Canadian brokerage firms). 
Intermediaries are required to seek voting instructions from Beneficial Shareholders in advance of Shareholders' meetings unless the Beneficial Shareholders have waived the right to receive meeting materials.  Every intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their Common Shares are voted at the Meeting.
If you are a Beneficial Shareholder, the form of proxy supplied to you by your broker (or its agent) is similar to the form of Proxy provided to registered Shareholders by the Company.  However, its purpose is limited to instructing the intermediary how to vote on your behalf.  The majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge Communications Solutions Canada ("Broadridge") in the United States and in Canada.  Broadridge mails a voting instruction form in lieu of a proxy provided by the Company.  The voting instruction form will name the Management Designees to represent you at the Meeting.  You have the right to appoint a person (who need not be a shareholder of the Company), other than the persons designated in the voting instruction form, to represent you at the Meeting.  To exercise this right, you should insert the name of the desired representative in the blank space provided in the voting instruction form.  The completed voting instruction form must then be returned to Broadridge by mail or facsimile or given to Broadridge by phone or over the internet, in accordance with Broadridge's instructions.  Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of Common Shares to be represented at the Meeting.  If you receive a voting instruction form from Broadridge, you cannot use it to vote Common Shares directly at the Meeting.  It must be returned to Broadridge well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the Common Shares voted.
Although, as a Beneficial Shareholder, you may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of voting Common Shares registered in the name of your broker (or agent of your broker), you may attend at the Meeting as proxyholder for your broker and vote the Common Shares in that capacity.  If you wish to attend at the Meeting and indirectly vote your Common Shares as proxyholder for your broker or have a person designated by you to do so, you should enter your own name, or the name of the person you wish to designate, in the blank space on the voting instrument form provided to you and return the same to your broker (or your broker's agent) in accordance with the instructions provided by your broker (or agent), well in advance of the Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  - 3 -    
[END TABLE]
Alternatively, you may request in writing that your broker send you a legal Proxy which would enable you, or a person designated by you, to attend at the Meeting and vote your Common Shares.
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
None of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who has held such a position since the beginning of the last completed financial year end of the Company, nor any proposed nominee for election as a director of the Company, nor any associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons, has any material interest, direct or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter to be acted on at the Meeting other than as disclosed herein. 
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF VOTING SECURITIES

Charter
The Company has adopted a charter (the "Charter") of the Audit Committee of the Board, which is attached as Schedule "A" to this Information Circular.
Composition
The current members of the Audit Committee are Frank G. Magdlen,, Sarah Johnson and Chris Karlin.  Messrs. Magdlen and Karlin and Ms. Johnson are independent members of the Audit Committee.  All members of the Audit Committee must meet the "independence" tests under National Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees ("NI 52-110").  Within the meaning of NI 52-110, all of the members of the Audit Committee are considered to be financially literate. 
In the course of its oversight of the Company's financial reporting process, the directors have: (1) reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2018; (2) received the auditor's report from Davidson & Company LLP, Chartered Accountants, independent auditors, on the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, "Communications with Audit Committees"; (3) received the written disclosures and the letter from the auditors required by Independence Standards Board Statement No. 1, "Independence Discussions with Audit Committee"; and (4) considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the auditors is compatible with maintaining their independence and has concluded that it is compatible at this time. 
Based on the Audit Committee's foregoing review and discussions, the Board has concluded that the audited financial statements should be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 and filed with the SEC. 
Relevant Education and Experience
All of the current members of the Audit Committee have financial experience and have served in senior management positions under which they have faced the breadth and level of complexity of issues which can reasonably be expected to be raised by financial statements of this Company.  In such capacities, the members of the Audit Committee have developed an understanding of the accounting principles used by the Company in the preparation of its financial statements and those principles used in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves and of internal controls and procedures used in the processes for financial reporting.

COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is currently composed of members Frank G. Magdlen, Sarah Johnson, and Chris Karlin. All of the members are "independent directors" as defined under applicable Canadian securities laws at the relevant times.  Prior to October 30, 2014, the Company did not have a Compensation Committee and the Board as a whole performed the equivalent functions.  As at the end of the financial year ended August 31, 2018, the Board was comprised of Donald M. Boone, Frank G. Magdlen, Charles Hopewell, Geoffrey Guilfoy and Sarah Johnson.  Prior to February 9, 2017, Donald M. Boone also served as President, CEO, Interim CFO and Treasurer of the Company and, as such, did not vote on any compensation payable to himself by the Company. 
As in prior years, judgments regarding executive compensation for fiscal 2018 have been primarily based upon the Board's assessment of each executive officer's leadership performance and their potential to enhance long-term shareholder value.  The Board relied mostly on each director's business acumen and was not bound by rigid guidelines, formulas or short-term changes in the share price when determining the amount and mix of elements regarding compensation payable for each executive officer.
Key factors that affect the Board's overall decision include the nature and scope of the executive officers' responsibilities, their effectiveness in leading the Company's initiatives to increase customer value as well as productivity and growth, ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws and the ethics policies of the Company.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  - 13 -    
[END TABLE]
Based on all these factors, which the Board considers relevant in making its determination of compensation payable, and in light of the Company's strong financial and operating performance, the Board believes it has been in the shareholders' best and long-term interests of the Company to ensure that the overall level of salary is commensurate with overall performance and in keeping with the Company's ability to retain key members of management team. 
The Board's decisions concerning specific elements of fiscal 2018 compensation for individual executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, includes consideration of the executive officer's level of responsibility, their overall performance and current salary.  As noted above, in all cases, the specific decisions involving the fiscal 2018 executive officer's compensation are ultimately based upon the Board's judgment about an individual executive officer's performance, their potential for future contributions and, more importantly, whether each particular payment or award provides an appropriate incentive and recompense for a performance that will sustain and enhance long-term shareholder value.
Charles Hopewell's compensation was initially approved by the Board effective as of his initial hire date. For Calendar 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended a new Compensation Plan for Mr. Hopewell. Under the Plan, Mr. Hopewell will receive a base salary of $190,000 annually: He will also receive an automatic bonus in fiscal years where revenue increases by a minimum of 3%. The percentage of the bonus will be based on the amount of the revenue increase, and there is no cap on the amount of the increase. 25% of the bonus will be paid in restricted shares, with the remaining 75% paid in either cash or restricted shares at the discretion of Mr. Hopewell. The Board may also approve an additional annual bonus at its discretion based on the increase in pre-tax operating profit from the prior year. Mr. Hopewell's new Compensation Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2017.  Mr. Hopewell will be granted $28,055 in restricted shares as a bonus, pending approval and ratification of the Restricted Share Plan by disinterested shareholders at the Meeting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
General
National Instrument 58-101 Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices ("NI 58-101") requires issuers to disclose the corporate governance practices that have been adopted according to guidance provided pursuant to National Policy 58-201 Corporate Governance Guidelines ("NP 58-201").
The Board believes that good corporate governance improves corporate performance and ultimately benefits all Shareholders.  The Canadian Securities Administrators (the "CSA") have adopted NP 58-201, which provides non-prescriptive guidelines on corporate governance practices for reporting issuers.  In addition, the CSA has implemented NI 58-101, which prescribes certain disclosure by reporting issuers of its corporate governance practices.  This section sets out the Company's approach to corporate governance and addresses the Company's compliance with NI 58-101.
The Company is also subject to the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the requirements of NASDAQ as well as comparable requirements under Canadian provincial securities legislation, including those relating to the certification of financial and other information prepared by or under the direction of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer; oversight of the Company's external auditors; enhanced independence criteria for audit committee members, the pre-approval of permissible non-audit services to be performed by the Company's external auditors; and the establishment of procedures for the anonymous submission of complaints regarding the Company's accounting practices (commonly known as whistleblower procedures).  The Company has established a Whistleblower Policy which was adopted by the Board on April 10, 2008.  Details of the Whistleblower Policy are posted under the heading, Investor Relations on the Company's website at www.jewettcameron.com.
The Board believes that sound corporate governance practices are essential to the effective, efficient and prudent operation of the Company and for the enhancement of shareholder value.  It is anticipated that the frequency of Board meetings may be increased, and the nature of the agenda items may be changed depending upon the state of the Company's affairs and in light of opportunities and risks which the Company may face.  The directors are kept abreast of the Company's operations at Board meetings as well as through updates, reports and discussions with management.
Pursuant to the requirements of NI 58-101, the Company is required to provide disclosure in this Information Circular of its corporate governance practices in accordance with Form 58-101F1, which are as follows.
Board of Directors
Within the meaning of NI 58-201, a majority of the members of the Company's current Board are considered "independent".  Mr. Magdlen. Mr. Karlin and Ms. Johnson are considered independent.  To encourage active participation from its independent members, the Board facilitates candid communication at Board meetings through open discussions and by prompting independent members for input on all issues brought before the Board.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  - 19 -    
[END TABLE]
The remaining members of the Board, Mr. Boone and Mr. Hopewell, are considered not independent as a former officer and officer, respectively, of the Company.  Further, Mr. Boone acts as the Chair of the Board.  As Chair, Mr. Boone is responsible for the oversight of all Board meetings and, in his duties, he provides strong leadership to the Board and the management thereof; he acts as a liaison between the Board and the Company's management and he represents himself on behalf of the Company to external groups. 
The Board provides leadership for its independent directors by ensuring that they understand their responsibilities and those of management and by encouraging the Board to work as a cohesive team.
During the most recently completed financial year, none of the existing directors or proposed directors of the Company were directors of any other reporting issuers.
The following table summarizes the attendance record of each director for each meeting of the directors from December 14, 2017 until December 14, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name  Number of Meetings Attended  Percentage of Meetings  
Donald M. Boone  5  100%  
Charles Hopewell  5  100%  
Frank Magdlen  5  100%  
Geoff Guiloy  5  100%

[END TABLE]
During the past financial year ended August 31, 2018 and up to December 14, 2018, the Board also passed, by unanimous consent, written resolutions on two occasions executed by all of the directors.
Board Mandate
At the present time, the Board does not have a written mandate.  The Board is responsible for the general supervision and management of the Company and its business.  Throughout the year, the Board discharges its responsibilities directly or through its standing committees, the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee.  The Board meets on a regular basis during which it reviews current business operations, corporate governance procedures and the financial results of the Company.
Position Descriptions
The Board has not yet prepared written descriptions for the positions of Chair of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer.  The Chair of the Board presides over all meetings of the directors and shareholders, initiates the calling of directors' meetings and sets the agenda for directors' meetings as well as acts as a liaison between the Board and other members of management.  The Chief Executive Officer's primary role is to manage the Company in an effective, efficient and forward-looking way, to fulfill the priorities, goals and objectives as determined by the Board and within the context of the Company's plans, and responsibilities, with a view to increasing shareholder value.  The Chief Executive Officer reports directly and is responsible to the Board. 
Further, the Board has not yet adopted position descriptions for the chair of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee.  However, the chair of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee is responsible on an informal basis for ensuring that an agenda is set for each applicable meeting and that the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee properly discharge its mandate.

[END TABLE]
Orientation and Continuing Education
The Board is responsible for establishing measures in connection with the orientation of new Board members regarding the role of the Board, its directors, any applicable committees of the Board and the nature and operation of the Company's business.  From time to time, the Board will consider making recommendations regarding the provision of continuing education for its Board members.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Company and the Board are committed to maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics.  Toward this end, the Board has adopted a formal code of business conduct and ethics for its directors and officers (the "Code of Ethics"), which reflects the business practices and principles of behaviour that support this commitment and in respect of which it monitors compliance.  The Code of Ethics is available under the heading, Investor Relations on the Company's website at www.jewettcameron.com.  A copy of the Code of Ethics is also available upon request from the Company's head office, North Plains, Oregon.  Since its implementation on April 10, 2008, there have been no material deviations from the Code of Ethics which may require the filing of a material change report.
Nomination of directors
The Board is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is responsible for, amongst other things, the identification of new candidates for nomination to the Board.  Presently, the Board analyzes the needs of the Board when a vacancy arises and identifies and recommends potential candidates for consideration as Board members.  In order to encourage an objective nomination process, the Board may from time to time seek outside assistance.  The Board has no standing nominating committee.
Compensation
The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, making recommendations regarding the appropriate level of compensation payable to the Company's directors and executive officers.  The process by which the Compensation Committee determines executive compensation is set out under "Compensation of Executive Officers".
The current members of the Compensation Committee are Frank G. Magdlen. Chris Karlin and Sarah Johnson. All of the members are "independent directors" as defined under applicable Canadian securities laws at the relevant times.
During the most recently completed financial year ended August 31, 2018, the Company paid a cash consideration to certain directors of the Company for director's services during the financial year ended August 31, 2018: Frank G. Magdlen, $2,600 (August 31, 2017: $6,600), Geoffrey Guilfoy, $2,333 (August 31, 2017: $800) and Sarah Johnson $2,167 (August 31, 2017: $400).  The Company has no standard arrangement pursuant to which directors are compensated by the Company for the provision of services in their capacity as directors, except for the granting of incentive stock options, from time to time, on terms and conditions acceptable to the regulatory authorities of Canada, notably the Ontario Securities Commission and the British Columbia Securities Commission.  The Company has granted no incentive stock options to directors, including directors who are Named Executive Officers (as defined herein) during the most recently completed financial year ended August 31, 2018 (August 31, 2017: Nil). 
Board Assessments
The Chair of the Board will provide oversight on the evaluation of the Board, and of its committees as applicable.  The Chair will receive comments from all directors and reports to the Board, as necessary.  All directors are free to make suggestions on the improvement of the Board's practices at any time and are encouraged to do so.
On an annual basis, the Chair of the Board is responsible for reviewing the requisite skills and characteristics of prospective Board members as well as the composition of the Board as a whole.

[END TABLE]
Other Board Committees

Employee Stock Ownership Plan
Effective August 31, 1995, the Company established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (United States) for the benefit of all U.S. employees who were employed by the Company on August 31, 1995 and whom had at least 1,000 hours with the Company during fiscal 1995.  The establishment of the ESOP resulted in the Company forming a trust, which in turn purchased from the Company's treasury 202,500 Common Shares at a price of C$2.22 per share on August 31, 1995. 
The ESOP covered all eligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company on August 31 of each year and who had at least 1,000 hours with the Company in the twelve months preceding that date.  The ESOP formerly granted to participants in the ESOP certain ownership rights in, but not possession of, the Common Shares of the Company held by the Trustee of the Plan.  The Company's CEO was the sole Trustee for the ESOP.  Common Shares were allocated annually to participants in the ESOP pursuant to a prescribed formula.  The amount of Common Shares allocated to each employee was equal to the employee's portion of the Company's overall payroll expressed in percentage terms.  There are no un-funded liabilities.
On February 17, 2003, shareholders approved the issuance of up to 225,000 common shares from treasury to the ESOP. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Named Executive Officers are participants in the ESOP.  As at the financial years ended August 31, 2017 and 2018, no Common Shares or Dollars were credited to the accounts of Mr. Hopewell and Mr. Nasser, with the ESOP.
Beginning in the financial year ended August 31, 2008, the compensation expense associated with the ESOP was invested on behalf of the plan participants in the Vanguard Star Fund, which is a low cost, broadly diversified mutual fund that owns both stocks and bonds.  This move by the Company was designed to provide plan participants with some degree of diversification in their ownership stake in the ESOP.  During fiscal 2011 and 2012, all of the Company's shares held by the ESOP were sold, with the majority repurchased by the Company and cancelled under the 10b5-1 share repurchase plans.  Effective June 30, 2012, the ESOP was terminated, subject to the approval of the Internal Revenue Service.  No further contributions were made to the ESOP.  On October 18, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued a favorable determination letter for the termination of the ESOP, and the Plan has distributed the remaining assets to participants

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL FIVE
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") entitle the Company's shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Information Circular pursuant to the SEC's rules. 
The Company's executive compensation programs are designed to (1) motivate and retain executive officers, (2) reward the achievement of the Company's short-term and long-term performance goals, (3) establish an appropriate relationship between executive pay and short-term and long-term performance, and (4) align executive officers' interests with those of the Company's shareholders. Under these programs, the Company's executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of financial operating goals and the realization of increased shareholder value. Please read the section herein entitled "Compensation of Executive Officers" for additional details about the Company's executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
The Board of Directors continually reviews the compensation programs for the Company's executive officers to ensure they achieve the desired goals of aligning the Company's executive compensation structure with the interests of the Company's shareholders and current market practices. 
The Company is asking shareholders to indicate their support for the Company's named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Information Circular. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives the Company's shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the Company's executive compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Company's named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Information Circular. Accordingly, the Company asks its shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Information Circular for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company. The Company's Board of Directors value the opinions of the Company's shareholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Information Circular, the Company will consider the concerns of the shareholders and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 
PROPOSAL SIX
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF HOLDING AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In addition to the advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation program, the Company is also holding a non-binding advisory vote by shareholders on the frequency with which shareholders would have an opportunity to hold an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation program. The Company has included this proposal among the items to be considered at the Meeting pursuant to the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act. The Company is providing shareholders the option of selecting a frequency of one, two or three years, or withholding. For the reasons described below, the Company recommends that shareholders select a frequency of one year.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
  - 25 -    
[END TABLE]
After careful consideration, our Board of Directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs annually is the most appropriate choice for the Company. In formulating its recommendation, our Board considered that an annual advisory vote on executive compensation will allow shareholders to provide us with their direct input on our compensation philosophy, policies and practices as disclosed in the proxy statement and information circular every year. 
The Company recognizes that shareholders may have different views as to the best approach for the Company, and therefore the Company and Board of Directors encourage shareholders to express their preferences as to the frequency of an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
This vote is advisory and not binding on the Company or the Board of Directors, but the Board of Directors will take into account the outcome of the vote when making decisions about how often the Company conducts advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
The proxy card provides shareholders with the opportunity to choose among four options (holding the vote every one, two or three years, or withholding) and, therefore, shareholders will not be voting to approve or disapprove the recommendation of the Board of Directors. 
The option of one year, two years or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast by shareholders will be the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation that has been selected by shareholders. However, because this vote is advisory and not binding on the Board of Directors or the Company, the Board may decide that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option most selected by shareholders. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR A "ONE-YEAR" FREQUENCY FOR HOLDING AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 
PROPOSAL SEVEN  PERMITTED AMENDMENTS TO OR VARIATIONS OF
Shareholders will be requested to consider any permitted amendments to or variations of any matter identified in the accompanying Notice, which may arise and be permitted by the Chair, at the Chair's discretion.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF ANY PERMITTED AMENDMENTS TO OR VARIATIONS OF ANY MATTER IDENTIFIED IN THE NOTICE.
PROPOSAL EIGHT  ADOPTION OF 2018 RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN
On November 12, 2018, the Board of Directors approved and ratified the adoption by the Company of a restricted share plan (the "Restricted Share Plan"), in the form attached as Schedule "B" hereto.  The Restricted Share Plan allows the Company to grant, from time to time, restricted shares to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company.
The Restricted Share Plan's principal purpose is to attract and motivate directors, officers, employees or consultants, and thereby advance the Company's interests by affording such persons with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company, through the issuance of restricted shares.
The Restricted Share Plan contains the following principal provisions:
 the maximum number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Restricted Share Plan will not exceed 1% of the then issued and outstanding number of Common Shares at the time of grant of an award of restricted shares;
[BEGIN TABLE]
  - 26 -    
[END TABLE]
 at the time a grant of restricted shares is made, the Board shall establish the period of time during which such restricted shares will be restricted and subject to forfeiture (the "Restricted Period";
 during the Restricted Period, the restricted shares may not be transferred, sold, exchanged, pledged or otherwise disposed of by the holder, other than (a) if the holder is deceased, (ii) by applicable laws of descent and distribution, or (iii) as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors.  Otherwise, during the Restricted Period, the holder of the restricted shares will have all other rights of a holder of Common Shares including the right to vote such shares and the right to receive any cash dividends;
 in the event that the holder of restricted shares ceases to be a director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company during the Restricted Period, those restricted shares which have not vested will be forfeited to the Company for no consideration; and
 upon expiration of the Restricted Period and any other conditions of grant, the restrictions on such restricted shares will lapse, and such shares shall be delivered to the holder free and clear of any resale restrictions and legends, except as otherwise may be required under applicable laws.
The foregoing is only a summary of the principal terms of the Restricted Share Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms and conditions of the Restricted Share Plan, attached as Schedule "B" hereto.
The approval of the Restricted Share Plan will require "Disinterested Shareholder Approval", being the approval of a majority of the votes cast by Shareholders excluding Charles Hopewell, CEO and interim CFO, who has been granted an award of restricted shares having an aggregate value of $28,055 under the Restricted Share Plan, subject to the approval and ratification of the Restricted Share Plan by disinterested shareholders at the Meeting.  Shareholders other than Mr. Hopewell will be asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, to approve, with or without variation, an ordinary resolution to approve the Restricted Share Plan.  The text of the ordinary resolution which Management intends to place before the Meeting for approval is as follows:
"RESOLVED, that:
1.
the restricted share plan of the Company, substantially in the form attached as Schedule "B" to the management information circular of the Company dated December 14, 2018 (the "Restricted Share Plan") be and is hereby approved, including the reservation for issuance thereunder at any time of a maximum number of restricted shares equal in number to 1% of common shares of the Company as at the time of issuance, and adopted as the restricted share plan of the Company;
2.
the form of the Restricted Share Plan may be amended in order to satisfy applicable laws, the requirements or requests of any regulatory authorities, including any stock exchange, without requiring further approval of the shareholders of the Company;
3.
any one director or officer of the Company is authorized and directed, on behalf of the Company, to take all necessary steps and proceedings and to execute, deliver and file any and all declarations, agreements, documents, and other instruments and do all such other acts and things that may be necessary or desirable to give effect to this resolution; and
4.
the directors of the Company may revoke this resolutions before it is acted upon without further approval of the shareholders." 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF ANY PERMITTED AMENDMENTS TO OR VARIATIONS OF ANY MATTER IDENTIFIED IN THE NOTICE.

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL NINE  OTHER MATTERS
The Company knows of no other matters that are likely to be brought before the Meeting.  If, however, other matters not presently known or determined properly come before the Meeting, the persons named as Proxyholders on the accompanying Proxy or their substitutes will vote such Proxy with respect to such matters in accordance with their discretion. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF VOTING ON ANY OTHER MATTERS THAT MAY COME PROPERLY BEFORE THE MEETING AT THE DISCRETION OF THE PROXYHOLDERS.
PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
Meeting Materials sent to Beneficial Shareholders who have not waived the right to receive Meeting Materials are accompanied by a Voting Instruction Form ("VIF").  This VIF is provided instead of a Proxy.  By returning the VIF in accordance with instructions as provided on it, a Non-Registered Shareholder is able to instruct the Registered Shareholder how to vote on behalf of the Non-Registered Shareholder.  VIF's, whether provided by the Company or by an Intermediary, should be completed and returned in accordance with the specific instructions noted on the VIF.
In either case, the purpose of this procedure is to permit Non-Registered Shareholders to direct the voting of the shares which they beneficially own.  Non-Registered Shareholders receiving a VIF cannot use that form to vote common shares directly at the Meeting - Non-Registered Shareholders should carefully follow the instructions set out in the VIF including those regarding when and where the VIF is to be delivered.  Should a Non-Registered Shareholder who receives a VIF wish to attend the Meeting or have someone else attend on their behalf, the Non-Registered Shareholder may request a legal proxy as set forth in the VIF, which will grant the Non-Registered Shareholder or their nominee the right to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Proposals which shareholders wish to be considered for inclusion in the Information Circular and proxy card for the 2019 Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders must be received by the Corporate Secretary of the Company on or before August 31, 2018, and must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Division 7 of Part 5 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

the integrity, adequacy and timeliness of the Company's financial reporting and disclosure practices;
(b)
the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to financial reporting; and
(c)

The Committee shall also perform any other activities consistent with this Charter, the Company's Articles and governing laws as the Committee or Board deems necessary or appropriate.
The Committee shall consist of at least three directors. Members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Board and may be removed by the Board in its discretion.

The independent auditors' responsibility is to audit the Company's financial statements and provide their opinion, based on their audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with GAAP.
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent auditors to be nominated for the purpose of auditing the Company's financial statements, preparing or issuing an auditor's report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the Company, and for reviewing and recommending the compensation of the independent auditors.  The Committee is also directly responsible for the evaluation of and oversight of the work of the independent auditors.  The independent auditors shall report directly to the Committee.
