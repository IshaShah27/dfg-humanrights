Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
In July we announced the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan – an acceleration of our strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, grow motorcycling and return our business to growth through 2022. Our execution is on track, and we met or exceeded all stated plan milestones in 2018. We are energized that we're getting new and different people to stand up and take notice of Harley-Davidson. 
Our current riders remain deeply engaged in the brand and tell us they too are excited at the direction we are headed. It's clear that the groundwork for an exciting future is being built in real time. 
The More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan addresses the challenges of today and the opportunities ahead of us through three growth catalysts: new products, broader access and stronger dealers. 
New Products 
We continue to demonstrate our clear commitment to the passions and preferences of our current riders. Our 2019 motorcycles are hands down our best ever – we launched new models and debuted rider confidence, performance and infotainment features. 
Our commitment to lead the electrification of motorcycling is also clear. In 2018, our first electric Harley-Davidson model, LiveWire™ made its debut, and we also provided a public glimpse of our broader electric portfolio. 
Even before the first LiveWire™ is in the hands of the first owner, we are reaping the strategic value of this extraordinary motorcycle. The buzz is captivating and inspiring new people about what's possible from Harley-Davidson and why riding is an exciting and emotionally charged activity filled with adrenaline and fun. 
Broader Access 
We are accelerating our progress to grow Harley-Davidson's reach and relevance by aligning our efforts in an integrated way, to attract and increase value for new and different consumers and meet people where they are and how they want to engage. 
In line with our plans to reach more urban dwellers and expand in emerging markets, 23 Harley-Davidson apparel stores were opened in high foot traffic areas throughout Asia in 2018. These stores offer a unique line of branded apparel, which we know is a gateway into Harley-Davidson. In our sample survey, over 75 percent of shoppers said it was their first visit to any Harley-Davidson store and over 60 percent were under 34 years old. 
In 2018, we also launched eCommerce in the U.S. (Amazon) and in China (T-Mall) and enhanced our eCommerce store on H-D.com. In 2018, total eCommerce sales were up 32 percent. 
We are building an integrated multi-channel retail experience that today's consumers expect and providing consumers an inspiring and convenient way to connect with Harley-Davidson products. 
Stronger Dealers 
In an environment of rapidly increasing customer expectations, we and our dealers must be prepared. Our dealers are critical as they bring the spirit of Harley-Davidson motorcycling to life each and every day. 
We are emphasizing dealer capabilities, and we significantly increased support and incentives under a performance framework. Part of this work includes creating conditions to enable dealer growth and improve the customer experience. 
Stronger Dealers means optimizing our network composition, providing more meaningful support tailored to individual dealers' needs and expanding our international footprint. In 2018, 56 international dealerships were opened.

Building the Next Generation of Riders Globally 
Underpinning all global efforts is our topline strategy to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders through 2027. We set 10-year objectives knowing this would be a long march to change the way people think about motorcycling. It requires our very best efforts, significant change, and it requires time. More Roads is our plan to accelerate our progress, and it includes clear deliverables through 2022. 
Our capabilities in building and retaining new riders are improving, and our 2018 marketing investments engaged new and existing riders. We continued the momentum we started in 2017 and ended 2018 with over 52,000 more Harley-Davidson riders in the U.S.* 
Looking forward, our efforts will intensify. We are on track with our new middleweight Adventure Touring and Streetfighter motorcycles planned to launch in 2020. The immense talent and capabilities of our teams continue to boldly expand how the look, sound and feel of Harley-Davidson motorcycles drive appeal with new types of people. 
We will continue to lead with passion and focus, to disrupt the status quo and ignite a cultural movement for motorcycling, inspiring new people AND our current riders to join us all along the way. 
On behalf of everyone at Harley-Davidson, thank you for your investment and continuing to ride with us.

Our executive compensation goals and guiding principles emphasize pay-for-performance. We base several elements of our compensation upon delivering high levels of performance relative to performance measures that the Human Resources Committee has approved. For example, (i) the annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and the performance shares require that we achieve financial performance before recipients are entitled to this compensation; and (ii) the equity component of our compensation program provides greater financial benefits when our stock price is increasing. Our goals and guiding principles are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-performance | Reward for exceptional  performance with higher pay outcomes, while delivering reduced or no incentive pay when performance expectations are not met.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align interests with those of our shareholders | Use equity-based awards and stock ownership guidelines, to focus management  on sustainable long-term growth and share price appreciation.

• Encourage outcomes and behaviors | Balance rewarding the delivery of near-term results that drive long-term performance,  while discouraging excessive or inappropriate risks.

• Align measures with our strategy and operating plan | Select performance measures that reflect our strategic objectives,  with goals that are challenging yet achievable during the applicable period.

The Board of Directors of Harley-Davidson, Inc. requests the proxy accompanying this Proxy Statement for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the Harley-Davidson Museum, 400 West Canal Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 4:30 p.m., Central Daylight Time, and at any adjournment or postponement of that meeting (the "Annual Meeting"). 
We first mailed the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to shareholders on March 29, 2019. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instructs shareholders and beneficial owners of our Common Stock on how they may access our proxy materials, which include our Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, via the internet. You will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request to receive these materials by following the instructions we provide later in this Proxy Statement and in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will instruct you on how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs how you may submit your proxy via the internet, mail or telephone, or in person at the Annual Meeting.

PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Shareholders will elect ten directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. We have significantly refreshed our Board of Directors since the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. Four of the director nominees – Ms. Sylvester and Messrs. Alstead, Golston and Niccol – became directors after the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and before the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Our Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for a Board of Directors that has between six and fifteen members. The Board determines the size from time to time by the vote of a majority of the current directors. The entire Board is elected annually. The Board currently consists of ten members with terms that expire at the Annual Meeting. 
Our By-laws have a majority vote standard for the election of directors. Because this is an uncontested election, the number of votes cast favoring each director nominee's election must exceed 50% of the total number of votes cast with respect to that nominee's election, including any votes withheld, for shareholders to elect the nominee. If an incumbent director is not elected, such incumbent director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman promptly following certification of the shareholder vote. Promptly after the Chairman receives such resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether the Board should accept the tendered resignation or reject it. Any shares not voted, whether due to abstentions or broker non-votes, will not have an impact on the election of directors. 
Unless you specify otherwise in your proxy, the persons you appointed will vote your shares "FOR" the Board of Directors' nominees that we name below. If any nominee becomes unable to serve, the persons you appointed may vote your shares for another person that the Board designates. 
Identified on the following pages are the ten director candidates that the Board of Directors has nominated. All ten nominees have advised us that they will serve if elected. We provide the following information for each nominee of the Board of Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• name;

PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL, BY ADVISORY VOTE, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Our shareholders may approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, our named executive officer ("NEO") compensation as disclosed in accordance with the executive compensation disclosure rules contained in Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K. At our 2017 annual meeting, we held a non-binding, advisory shareholder vote on the frequency of future advisory shareholder votes on the compensation of our NEOs. Our shareholders expressed a preference that advisory shareholder votes on the compensation of our NEOs be held on an annual basis, and as previously disclosed, the company continued the policy to hold such votes annually. Accordingly, as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are asking shareholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs. 
The vote on this proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and the accompanying executive compensation tables and narrative discussion contained in this Proxy Statement. The company asks that you support the compensation of our NEOs as so disclosed. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Human Resources Committee, the Board or the company. However, the HR Committee will review the voting results and consider them when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
Our executive compensation goals and guiding principles emphasize pay-for-performance. We base several elements of our compensation upon delivering high levels of performance relative to performance measures that the Human Resources Committee has approved. For example, (i) the annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and the performance shares require that we achieve financial performance before recipients are entitled to this compensation; and (ii) the equity component of our compensation program provides greater financial benefits when our stock price is increasing. Our goals and guiding principles are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-performance | Reward for exceptional  performance with higher pay outcomes, while delivering reduced or no incentive pay when performance expectations are not met.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align interests with those of our shareholders | Use equity-based awards and stock ownership guidelines, to focus management  on sustainable long-term growth and share price appreciation.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage outcomes and behaviors | Balance rewarding the delivery of near-term results that drive long-term performance,  while discouraging excessive or inappropriate risks.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align measures with our strategy and operating plan | Select performance measures that reflect our strategic objectives,  with goals that are challenging yet achievable during the applicable period.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target pay competitively and appropriately | Set target compensation within a 20% range of the 50th percentile of our  compensation peer group for target performance to remain market competitive and to attract and retain top executive talent.    
[END TABLE]
We describe the individual elements that make up our total compensation more fully in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement. We believe our executive compensation programs are structured to best support our company and our business objectives. 
Overall company performance in 2018 exceeded targeted levels for our short-term incentive plan with improvements in revenue, net income, and EPS, despite the challenging operating environment. Looking more broadly, there were many achievements for the Company in 2018, such as accomplishing all of the 2018 More Roads to Harley-Davidson milestones, a 20% increase in cash from operations, a net increase of over 52,000 new riders in the U.S., increased international sales and record operating income for HDFS. 
This overall performance translated into an above target outcome under the short-term incentive plan. Payouts under the long-term incentive plan for the three-year performance share cycle that ended in 2018 were below target reflecting the ongoing decline in the U.S. industry. The Committee is comfortable that the outcomes under these plans reasonably reflect the balance of short- and long-term performance and that management is taking the right actions today to build a sustainable business for the future. 
Accordingly, for the reasons we discuss above, the Board recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion. 
The votes cast "for" this proposal must exceed the votes cast "against" this proposal for approval of the compensation of our NEOs, assuming that a quorum is present. For purposes of determining the vote regarding this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute a vote "for" or "against" the proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of "votes cast." Proxies solicited by the Board will be voted "FOR" approval of the compensation unless a shareholder specifies otherwise.

PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent auditors retained to audit our financial statements. The Audit and Finance Committee selected Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, and the committee is presenting this selection to shareholders for ratification. Ernst & Young LLP has served as our independent auditor since 1982. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to shareholders' questions and to make a statement, if they so desire. 
If, prior to the Annual Meeting, Ernst & Young LLP declines to act as our independent registered public accounting firm or the Audit and Finance Committee does not want to use Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit and Finance Committee will appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Finance Committee will present any new independent registered public accounting firm for the shareholders to ratify at the Annual Meeting. If the shareholders do not ratify the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP at the Annual Meeting, then the Audit and Finance Committee will reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP. 
To ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the votes cast "for" this proposal must exceed the votes cast "against" it. For purposes of determining the vote regarding this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes (if any) do not constitute a vote "for" or "against" the proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of "votes cast." Unless you specify otherwise in your proxy, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares "FOR" ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we hired Ernst & Young LLP to perform the annual audit and to provide audit-related and tax services. The Audit and Finance Committee Charter requires that the Audit and Finance Committee pre-approve all Ernst & Young LLP services. The Audit and Finance Committee also pre-approved all fees that we incurred for services that Ernst & Young LLP provided. The fees we incurred for services that Ernst & Young LLP provided during the past two years are listed in the following table. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 FEES PAID TO ERNST & YOUNG LLP    2018      2017   
 Audit fees    $ 3,300,000      $ 3,117,000   
 Audit-related fees    $ 138,500      $ 169,200   
 Tax fees    $ 590,300      $ 432,700   
 All other fees      —        —   
[END TABLE]
Audit fees included fees for the audit of our consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This category also includes fees for audits provided in connection with government filings or services that generally only the principal auditor can reasonably provide to a client, such as comfort letters, procedures related to debt financing, consents and reviews of documents that we file with the SEC. Audit-related services included audits of employee benefit plans and consultation on accounting and internal control matters. Tax services included tax advice, planning, compliance and transaction consulting. 
To assure continuing external auditor independence, the Audit and Finance Committee and its Chair considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent external audit firm, reviews and evaluates the lead audit partner and his or her team, and ensures the rotation of the lead audit partner and other audit personnel as required by applicable laws and regulations. The Audit and Finance Committee has procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services that the independent registered public accounting firm provides. These procedures include reviewing and approving a budget for audit and permitted non-audit services. The budget includes a description of, and a budgeted amount for, particular categories of non-audit services that are recurring in nature and that we anticipate at the time we prepare the budget. In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee has established a policy that the fees we pay for non-audit services must be less than the fees we pay for audit and audit-related services. Audit and Finance Committee approval is required to exceed the budget amount for a particular category of non-audit services and to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for any non-audit services not included in the budget. For both types of pre-approval, the Audit and Finance Committee considers whether the services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit and Finance Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service. The Audit and Finance Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more members of the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee monitors the services that our independent

In November 2018, the Human Resources Committee reviewed the Human Resources Committee Charter and recommended to the Board that no changes were necessary. 
The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Human Resources Committee are independent under New York Stock Exchange rules. 
The Human Resources Committee has overall responsibility for reviewing total direct compensation (consisting of base salaries, short-term incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation) for our senior leaders. In addition, the Human Resources Committee reviews other aspects of compensation, such as deferred compensation plans, retirement plans, and health and welfare plans. 
The Human Resources Committee has the authority to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist it in performing its responsibilities. Since 2010, the Human Resources Committee has retained the services of Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC. Representatives of Meridian report to the Chair of the Human Resources Committee. On an annual basis, the Human Resources Committee reviews and approves the scope of Meridian's services regarding executive compensation, Meridian's performance and the fees related to work Meridian performed for the Human Resources Committee. The Human Resources Committee retains the right to terminate Meridian's services at any time. Meridian's primary responsibilities to the Human Resources Committee include providing: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• independent competitive market data and advice related to our CEO's compensation level and incentive design;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a review of our compensation levels, performance goals and incentive designs for the named executive officers; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• benchmark data on executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
The Human Resources Committee has considered all factors relevant to Meridian's independence from management and determined that Meridian is independent and that Meridian's performance of services raises no conflict of interest. The Human Resources Committee's conclusion was based in part on a report that Meridian provided to the Committee intended to reveal any potential conflicts of interest. 
Each November, the Human Resources Committee reviews executive compensation benchmarking data that Meridian prepares. The following February, the CEO proposes total target compensation, consisting of base salary, a target short-term incentive opportunity

 and a target value of long-term incentive opportunity, for NEOs (except with respect to his or her own compensation) based on benchmark data as well as company and individual performance. The CEO's recommendations are subject to the review and approval by the Human Resources Committee, which makes the final determination. 
The Human Resources Committee establishes goals and objectives with the CEO and evaluates at least annually the performance of the CEO in light of these goals and objectives. The Human Resources Committee reviews and approves the total compensation of the CEO on an annual basis, including base salary, with input from all of the independent directors on the Board (who comprise the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) on the performance of the CEO in meeting his or her goals and objectives and concerning the CEO's total compensation. 
The Human Resources Committee annually approves several Short-Term Incentive Plans ("STIPs") to motivate and reward the performance of employees of Harley-Davidson and its subsidiaries. The Human Resources Committee also reviews and approves target STIP opportunities for our executive leadership team, which is comprised of our CEO and executives who report directly to the CEO, including all NEOs. The Human Resources Committee approves grants of awards to the CEO and executives who report directly to the CEO, including all NEOs, and the CEO approves grants to other employees within parameters that the Committee has approved. The Human Resources Committee has authorized the CEO to make equity grants to employees in certain other instances (except to executives who report directly to the CEO, including all NEOs), including to help recruit a new employee or retain a current employee or to reward an employee for exceptional service or such other instance that the CEO believes is in the company's best interest.

The Board has determined that all members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent under New York Stock Exchange rules. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter outlines the criteria for identifying and recommending new candidates to serve on the Board. In considering any potential candidate for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the following qualifications: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• principal employment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• expertise relevant to the company's business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the potential candidate will add diversity to the Board, including whether the potential candidate brings  complementary skills and viewpoints;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• time commitments, particularly the number of other boards on which the potential candidate may serve;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• independence and absence of conflicts of interest under New York Stock Exchange rules and other laws, regulations and rules;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• financial literacy and expertise; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal qualities including strength of character, maturity of thought process and judgment, values and ability to work  with collegiality.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's Charter has long required the committee to consider diversity in its process of selecting director nominees. Specifically, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates each candidate for director on, among other things, the basis of the diversity that he or she would bring to the Board, including with respect to business and professional experiences, skills, ethnicity and gender. We believe this policy has been effective in creating a Board comprised of diverse members and that the composition of the current Board reflects the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's consideration of diversity in its evaluation and nomination process. 
During 2016, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed its succession planning process in light of certain directors who were approaching the retirement age specified in our Bylaws. A third-party search firm assisted the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with its recruitment efforts. The search firm recommended candidates that satisfied the Board's criteria. The search firm also provided research and pertinent information regarding candidates, as the Committee requested. As a result of the succession planning process, four director candidates became new directors after the 2016 annual meeting and before the 2017 annual meeting. All such director candidates were recommended by the third-party search firm. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates that shareholders recommend. Shareholders may recommend candidates for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider by writing to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in care of our Secretary, 3700 West Juneau Avenue, P.O. Box 653, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-0653. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's policy regarding director candidates that shareholders recommend and the process for evaluating the nominees are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If a shareholder has complied with procedures to recommend director candidates that the Nominating and Corporate Governance  Committee has established, then the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates that the shareholder has recommended for available seats on the Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In making recommendations to the Board of one or more candidates to serve as a director, the Nominating and Corporate  Governance Committee will examine each director candidate on a case-by-case basis regardless of who recommended the candidate. The Nominating and Corporate Governance  Committee evaluates candidates in the same manner whether a shareholder or the Board has recommended the candidate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In general, for each candidate that any person or group brings to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance  Committee for consideration for nomination as a director, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will first make a determination whether the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should consider the candidate at that  time based on factors the Chair deems relevant, including our current need for qualified candidates and the Chair's view as to whether the candidate has sufficient qualifications for further consideration for nomination as a director.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Chair determines that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should consider the candidate, then the Chair  will report that determination to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and communicate all relevant information to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee member is responsible for sending feedback on a candidate to the Chair.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may take any additional steps it deems necessary to determine whether to recommend the candidate to the full Board.  
[END TABLE]
To enable the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider a shareholder recommendation in connection with the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, we must receive the recommendation on or before November 30, 2019.

Submitting a shareholder recommendation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not ensure that shareholders will have an opportunity to vote on the shareholder's candidate because the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may determine not to recommend the candidate to the full Board or the full Board may determine not to recommend the candidate to shareholders. Any shareholder who wants to ensure that shareholders will have an opportunity to vote on the shareholder's candidate may nominate the director candidate for the shareholders to vote on at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, in addition to recommending the candidate to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, by giving proper written notice to our Secretary in advance of the 2020 annual meeting. To give that proper notice, a shareholder must comply with the terms and time periods of our Restated Articles of Incorporation as supplemented by our By-laws. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation state that a shareholder must give written notice that complies with the Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws to our Secretary not less than 60 days before the date in 2020 corresponding to the date we released this Proxy Statement to our shareholders. Because we anticipate mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials on March 29, 2019, we must receive notice of a nomination for a director candidate for shareholders to consider at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders no later than January 29, 2020. Even if a shareholder delivers a timely notice and otherwise complies with the terms and time periods of our Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, we will not be obligated to name the shareholder's candidate in our proxy materials. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for establishing, reviewing and revising compensation we pay to our directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, working with management and third-party compensation consultants and reviewing benchmarked data from a comparator group of companies, determines director compensation that it believes is competitive with these companies. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews and revises, when necessary, the Director Compensation Policy, generally with the aid of a compensation consultant.

In February 2018, the Sustainability Committee reviewed the Sustainability Committee Charter and recommended to the Board that no changes were necessary. 
The Sustainability Committee plays an integral role in providing oversight, advice and assistance to the Board and to the company's management in developing, implementing and monitoring social and environmental policies, practices and strategies that will foster sustainable growth of the company on a global basis. We define sustainable growth as the ability to grow and operate our business by preserving and renewing the company's heritage through global opportunities for shared value creation and inclusion. Sustainable growth is driven through leadership and continually challenging the company's business model, strategies, processes, products, services and other capabilities to realize the substantial long-term value of the company, our heritage, our environment and our people.

As part of providing oversight, advice and assistance to the Board in fostering sustainable growth, the Sustainability Committee assists the Board in ensuring that the company grows without increasing our environmental impact, which is consistent with the company's current strategic plan and our long-term sustainability objective. 
BOARD MEETINGS, ATTENDANCE, EXECUTIVE SESSIONS AND ANNUAL MEETING ATTENDANCE 
In 2018, there were six meetings of the Board. All director nominees attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served during 2018. 
The Board met in executive sessions during all regularly scheduled in-person meetings, without management present, and plans to continue that practice going forward. The non-executive Chairman of the Board, Mr. Cave presided over these executive sessions. 
Unless a director has a conflict in his or her schedule, we expect all directors to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All of our directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and were available to answer any shareholder questions. 
LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Currently, our Board leadership structure includes a non-executive Chairman of the Board who is an independent director. Our Corporate Governance Policy gives the Board the flexibility and authority to modify this leadership structure as and when appropriate to best address the company's current circumstances and to advance the best interests of all shareholders. Mr. Cave serves as our non-executive Chairman of the Board. 
The Board currently believes that separating the CEO and Chairman roles will enable our CEO, Mr. Levatich, to focus on the business strategy and operations of the company, while an independent Chairman will provide the continuity of leadership of the Board necessary for the Board to fulfill its responsibilities. 
THE BOARD'S ROLE IN THE OVERSIGHT OF RISK 
While the Board has the ultimate responsibility for oversight of the risk management process, various committees of the Board have a role in the oversight of risk management. In particular, the Audit and Finance Committee focuses on financial risk, including the oversight of the systems of internal control over financial reporting, and it receives an assessment of the company's systems to monitor and manage business risk from our independent registered public accounting firm. Internal audit regularly reviews risk management processes and internal controls with the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee also monitors cybersecurity risk and receives a report at each regular Audit and Finance Committee meeting on legal and compliance matters. In addition, the Human Resources Committee reviews our compensation programs for compensation risk as we describe further in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement. Risk management is an integral part of our annual strategic planning process. The entire Board reviews the strategic risk management plan at least annually. 
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION WITH THE BOARD 
Shareholders and other parties interested in communicating with the Chairman of the Board or with non-management directors, including committee chairs, may do so by writing to such director, in care of our Secretary, 3700 West Juneau Avenue, P.O. Box 653, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-0653.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
In December 2002, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee adopted a written policy regarding transactions with related persons. The committee amended this policy, which we refer to as our Conflict of Interest Process for Directors, Executive Officers and other Employees, in December 2003. 
Under the policy, conflict of interest issues for the CEO or any director shall be submitted to and reviewed by the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. If the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that an actual conflict of interest issue exists, then the entire Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the potential conflict of interest. If our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that an actual conflict exists, the Committee decides whether to waive the conflict or require the CEO or director to remove the conflict. Any conflicts that are waived by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are promptly disclosed to our shareholders. 
Any potential conflict that arises for any executive officer (other than our CEO and the Vice President and Chief Legal Officer) is reviewed by our Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. Any potential conflict that arises for our Vice President and Chief Legal Officer is reviewed by our CEO. When reviewing a potential conflict of interest, if the Vice President and Chief Legal Officer or CEO determines that a conflict of interest issue exists, the Chair of the Human Resources Committee reviews the issue. If the Chair of the Human Resources Committee agrees that a conflict of interest issue exists, then the entire Human Resources Committee reviews the issue. If the Human Resources Committee also agrees that a conflict exists, the Committee decides whether to waive the conflict or require the officer to remove the conflict. Any conflicts that are waived by our Human Resources Committee are promptly disclosed to our shareholders. 
Any conflict of interest issue involving any other employee is reviewed by an attorney in our Legal Department. If the attorney believes that an actual conflict of interest issue exists, then the attorney submits the conflict of interest issue to our Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. If our Vice President and Chief Legal Officer determines that an actual conflict exists, then he decides what steps should be taken to resolve the conflict. 
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS 
During 2018, there were no transactions with directors that would require disclosure under SEC rules. In determining whether directors are independent, the Board considered Mr. Linebarger's role at Cummins Inc. Mr. Linebarger, a director, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cummins Inc. During 2018, we continued a modest commercial relationship with Cummins, a relationship that existed before Mr. Linebarger joined the Board of Directors, under which we purchased exhaust parts and components from subsidiary companies of Cummins Inc. The transactions were negotiated on an arm's-length basis and were below $120,000. Accordingly, the relationship does not prevent Mr. Linebarger from qualifying as an independent director and the Board considers Mr. Linebarger to be an independent director. Because Mr. Linebarger is the current Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the entire Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (excluding Mr. Linebarger) considered this relationship under our Conflict of Interest Process, and it determined that no actual conflict of interest issue exists as a result of the relationship.

Letter from the Human Resources Committee 
The Board and the Human Resources Committee at Harley-Davidson, Inc. are committed to providing shareholders with a thorough and comprehensible description of our executive compensation program and insight into how we govern compensation. 
During 2018, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matt Levatich, announced our More Roads to Harley-Davidson accelerated plan for growth, which supports our 2027 objectives with increased focus and strategic investment to reinvigorate our U.S. business while accelerating the pace of international growth. To successfully deliver on this plan, it is critical that our compensation program continues to:

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforce our pay-for-performance culture.   
[END TABLE]
Harley-Davidson is facing the realities of a challenging global industry environment and a domestic market that has been declining. While we know that market challenges persist, we are facing this head-on with drive, clarity in purpose and a plan we believe will deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. More than ever, this requires the Committee to be thoughtful as we set performance targets, to ensure that they reflect realistic yet aspirational long-term and sustainable growth prospects, without encouraging excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. This reality means that, in the near-term, our performance goals may not reflect growth year-over-year as we make the necessary investments to transition our business and deliver sustainable growth. 
Against this backdrop, we engaged in shareholder outreach during 2018 to inform Committee discussions about changes to our compensation program. Through this shareholder outreach effort, we received support for our management team and compensation program, while also learning more about our shareholders' perspectives. The outreach enabled us to better understand shareholders' reasons for voting either for or against our say-on-pay resolution at the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
We would like to highlight some of the key areas that the Committee focused on during 2018, which are further explained in the remainder of the Compensation Discussion & Analysis that follows.

Highlights of the changes to our executive compensation program 
Over the last 24 months, the Committee has approved a number of changes to the Harley-Davidson compensation program to ensure continued alignment with our evolving strategy, embrace the highest levels of good governance and incorporate feedback received from our shareholders. These changes represent an evolution of our program to support our strategy and purpose, underpinned by our pay-for-performance philosophy. We summarize them below.

The Committee decided to modify the mix of performance shares (from 67% to 60%) and restricted stock units (from 33% to 40%) following the removal of the second component of our short-term incentive plan in 2018, the Leadership STIP. In addition, with the removal of the Leadership STIP, the Committee increased the short-term incentive plan and long-term incentive plan targets to maintain market competitiveness, while remaining within the range we target, which resulted in greater emphasis on long-term incentives than in prior years. 
The Committee is confident that these changes, which we believe are responsive to shareholder concerns and grounded in our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan and purpose as an organization, enable us to incent, retain and reward our executives as we navigate the next chapter in our journey.

Pay and performance in respect of 2018 
Overall Company performance in 2018 exceeded targeted levels for our short-term incentive plan, despite the challenging operating environment HDMC delivered modest improvements in revenue and net income and 5.6% growth in EPS. A decline in HDMC's operating income impacted net earnings, while HDFS saw record operating income. Looking more broadly, there were many achievements for the Company, such as accomplishing all of the 2018 More Roads to Harley-Davidson milestones, a 20% increase in cash from operations, a net increase of over 50,000 new riders in the U.S. and increased international sales. 
This overall performance translated into an above target outcome under the short-term incentive plan with positive scores on three of the four measures. Payouts under the long-term incentive plan for the three-year performance share cycle that ended in 2018 were below target reflecting the ongoing decline in the U.S. industry. The Committee is comfortable that the outcomes under these plans reasonably reflect the balance of short- and long-term performance and that management is taking the right actions today to build a sustainable business for the future. 
In addition to our normal incentive plans, the Committee approved a one-time award of 10,000 restricted stock units for Larry Hund, the President and Chief Operating Officer of HDFS. The Committee approved the award in February 2018 with a grant date fair value of $475,000, in recognition of his continued strong performance and to provide a retention incentive for Mr. Hund, given the importance of HDFS to our overall business strategy. The restricted stock units will cliff vest on the third anniversary. There is no accelerated vesting for retirement so Mr. Hund must be an active employee on the third anniversary of the grant to receive the award. The Committee made no other awards outside of our annual grants in 2018 to our Named Executive Officers. 
Approval of Performance Goals for 2019 Incentive Plans 
The Committee establishes meaningful goals for performance-based compensation including performance measures, measure weighting, thresholds, targets and maximums for incentive plan compensation. We set targets based on our operating plan and intend that they will drive our strategy. The Committee determined there was a reasonable likelihood that employees could achieve the goals and earn incentive compensation at the target performance level. 
Looking to the future 
The Committee believes that the executive compensation program changes it introduced in 2018, and those that it has approved for 2019, will ensure the continued alignment of our executives' interests with sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders, while retaining a team that understands our employees, dealers, and current and future enthusiasts. This focus remains grounded in our purpose and values as a company as we seek to build the next generation of riders globally, in a responsible way. 
Collectively, our Named Executive Officers beneficially own Harley-Davidson shares with a value of about $35 million based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 and they have a combined tenure of 85 years. While we appreciate that our current business climate is challenging for our shareholders, this team has a vested interest in the successful execution of our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan, which the compensation program that we describe in the balance of this report reinforces. Beyond that, our team is committed to growing this company responsibly, with an eye to the long-term sustainability of our brand and planet. 
We thank those shareholders that took the time to engage with us during the year; your constructive feedback was helpful. We welcome an ongoing dialogue as we look to the future.

COMPENSATION DESIGN 
Executive Compensation Philosophy 
While we have announced an accelerated plan to support our 2027 objectives, we intend the cornerstone principles of our compensation philosophy, which focus on pay-for-performance, to be evergreen in nature. 
Alignment with the More Roads to Harley-Davidson Plan 
Our compensation philosophy is aligned with the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan as we ensure the right performance measures and goals are reflected in our incentive plans and are relevant to plan participants. Our strategy is to build the next generation of riders globally, fostering the incredible feeling of personal freedom people get from riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. There are five key 2027 objectives that we have designed to support this strategy: 
While the operating environment in our industry is facing challenges in the short-term, we are confident that our long-term strategy and the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan sets us up for success. By focusing on attracting new and different people to the brand, riders and non-riders, by launching innovative new products that align with our purpose and by anticipating and meeting changing consumer demands, and doing so in a financially responsible manner, we believe we have an opportunity to bring the thrill of riding to an expanded consumer base over the long-term.

Pay Mix 
The majority of target compensation for our Named Executive Officers, including the CEO, is at-risk variable compensation, with a heavy use of equity-based compensation. This reflects the cornerstone principles of our compensation philosophy: pay-for-performance through the use of at-risk variable pay, use of equity compensation to align executives' interests with those of our shareholders, and to encourage both outcomes and behaviors through the use of a mix of compensation elements. The following graphs set out the value of compensation elements assuming performance at target. 
Note: Based on 2018 target compensation; other NEOs is an average across the NEOs other than the CEO. 
Pay-for-Performance at Harley-Davidson
We have designed our compensation program such that compensation outcomes in years of strong performance should trend above target, while outcomes trend downward in years where performance is below expectations. There are a variety of factors that can impact this trend year-to-year, including, but not limited to, broad consumer and economic market factors, changes in global trade conditions, raw material and labor costs. 
Based on outcomes, our incentive plans are working as designed and intended. Over the last five years, the outcomes under our financial incentive plans have been in line with performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The financial component of the short-term incentive plan (or "STIP") paid out below target in three of the last  five years; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The long-term incentive plan (delivered in cash prior to 2016) has paid out below target in four of the five years.   
[END TABLE]
As a result, our NEOs have realized pay that is lower than both their target compensation and the compensation that we have reported for them in the Summary Compensation Table.

While the Summary Compensation Table discloses the fair value of equity awards in accordance with the SEC requirements, the Summary Compensation Table values do not illustrate the alignment of pay with performance. Over the four-year period 2015 to 2018, the chart below compares the CEO's annual realized pay (what he actually "earned") to the CEO's target pay (the pay opportunity available for achieving target performance). For the purpose of this chart, we have calculated each element of compensation as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   ELEMENT    DEFINITION – TARGET    DEFINITION – ACTUAL 
   ELEMENT    DEFINITION – TARGET    DEFINITION – ACTUAL 
 Salary        Salary received in the year        Salary received in the year 
 Short-Term Incentive        Target bonus award under the STIP element, including the  Leadership component if relevant for the year        Actual bonus received under the STIP element for the  year 
 Long-Term Incentives        Target value at time of grant of restricted stock units that  vested during the year and of long-term cash or vested performance shares earned in the year as the final year of a 3-year performance period        Actual value at vesting of restricted stock units that vested  during the year and the value of long-term cash or vested performance shares earned in the year as the final year of a 3-year performance period 
[END TABLE]
As the graphic shows, our CEO's actual (or "realized") compensation has consistently trended below target opportunities over his four years as CEO. We believe this demonstrates that our compensation program is designed appropriately and is effective at achieving our pay-for-performance objectives.

COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE 
Compensation Oversight 
The Human Resources Committee, which Michael J. Cave chairs, consists of four independent outside directors. During 2018, the Committee met four times and it has overall responsibility for approving the total direct compensation of our executive leadership team, which includes the CEO and all NEOs. In addition, the Committee reviews other aspects of compensation, such as our deferred compensation plans, retirement plans and health and welfare plans. The Committee is also involved in considering the results of an annual talent assessment and reviewing succession plans for leadership roles. 
The Committee receives information and support from an independent advisor, as well as management, both of which impact the ultimate recommendations the Committee makes to the Board. 
Shareholders can find additional information on the Committee on page 14 in the [Board of Directors – Corporate Governance section]. 
Use of an Independent Advisor 
The Committee has the sole authority to engage the services of outside advisors, experts, and others to assist in performing its duties. Since 2010, the Committee has retained the services of Meridian Compensation Partners LLC to provide services and advice related to executive compensation. Each year, the Committee reviews and approves the scope and associated fees for Meridian's services, and the subsequent performance. The primary areas of support Meridian provides include:

The Annual Process
The Committee approves an annual calendar each year, which sets out the items that it will address at each meeting. Across the four meetings, the Committee primarily reviews and approves items related to the CEO as well as broader executive officer compensation. Beyond that group, the Committee annually approves various incentive plans that apply more broadly across Harley-Davidson, which aligns our employees with the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan, while also providing an opportunity for individual performance recognition. The Committee also reviews succession plans for the leadership team and reviews an annual talent assessment.

In the sub-sections that follow, we provide additional details on some of the most important aspects of the Committee's work in 2018. 
Shareholder Engagement 
Harley-Davidson takes shareholder input and feedback seriously, and our senior management and Investor Relations regularly interact with our shareholders. Since the introduction of say-on-pay, Harley-Davidson has earned high levels of shareholder support with a vote averaging above 96%. While the majority of our shareholders also voted in favor of say-on-pay in 2018, the level of support dropped to 63%. Given this outcome on the say-on-pay vote, the Committee Chair, Chief Human Resources Officer, Investor Relations and Corporate Secretary launched an effort to understand the cause and any areas of concern related to our compensation program as expressed by shareholders. We targeted our largest shareholders representing approximately 50% of outstanding shares. We held telephonic meetings with shareholders who accepted our invitation to engage which represented approximately 25% of outstanding shares. We specifically focused on executive compensation. 
In general, shareholders were supportive of our executive compensation philosophy, but did have questions about some aspects of how we set compensation and the overarching alignment of pay with performance. Many of the questions shareholders asked aligned with strategic reviews that were already underway, including the design of our variable compensation plans and the composition of our compensation peer group. The outreach also indicated we could improve the explanation of our decisions in our CD&A and highlight feedback we have acted on.

Compensation Peer Group 
On an annual basis, the Committee undertakes a review of the compensation peers that we use to provide insight into market competitive pay levels and practices. Defining a relevant compensation peer group is challenging, as we are the only publicly traded motorcycle company in the U.S., and one of only a handful globally. We use two comparator groups, reflecting the skills and experience we require in our leadership team: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     the first consists of companies for whom  manufacturing and engineering are key attributes  the Manufacturing Peer Group (weighted at 60%); and       the second consists of companies for whom the maintenance of a  strong product brand is a key attribute  the Branded Peer Group (weighted at 40%).   Experience with both of these aspects of our business is critical in the talent we recruit; equally, these are skills that other companies seek in candidates, meaning  that our executives can be targets for them.             How were the two groups used in 2018?   The Committees independent advisor prepared a report, which set out 50th percentile  market data for each peer group (i.e., two separate data points), and a blended 50th percentile, developed by taking the Manufacturing  50th percentile and weighting it at 60% and the Brand 50th percentile and weighting it at 40%   The Committees independent advisor presents both regressed (i.e.,  adjusted to reflect Harley-Davidsons size based on observed relationships between revenue and compensation) and non-regressed (i.e., raw, unadjusted) data under the above basis. The Committee considered  both data points when reviewing target compensation and decided to maintain existing pay levels and targets that are within the range of plus or minus 20% of median for both data points.

Changes to the Peer Group for 2019 
As part of our 2018 review, the Committee took the opportunity to assess our principles of peer group selection. While we remained confident that we were utilizing a peer group based on the right attributes, we determined that the group had become too large with a number of out-sized peers in comparison to the size and complexity of Harley-Davidson. The feedback we received from our shareholders in 2018 subsequently reinforced this approach. 
As a result, the Committee revised the methodology and approach it took to construct the compensation benchmarking peer groups and approved new Manufacturing and Branded Peer Groups for 2019 reflecting the following decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Maintained our  two-peer group methodology to reflect both the manufacturing and the brand-name dimensions of our Company;       Confirmed that our historical approach of using a single, blended  market value continues to be appropriate;       Confirmed our weighting factors of 60% and 40% remained appropriate and relevant, given the core manufacturing focus of Harley-Davidson;       Established new upper revenue limits for potential peers reflecting  our current business size (including eliminating any peers with revenue greater than 2.5 times HDIs fiscal 2017 revenue of $5.647 billion), thus avoiding companies that are significantly larger, with a view to positioning Harley-Davidson  closer to the median revenue of each peer group;         Determined that targeting a total number of peers  in each group of around 15-20 companies was appropriate, to ensure year-over-year stability without becoming unnecessarily large;       Decided to consider both regressed data (i.e., compensation data  adjusted to reflect Harley-Davidsons size based on observed relationships between revenue and compensation, to normalize pay differences that may be caused by different revenue size of our peers) as we have done in the past, in combination  with non-regressed raw data and maintained existing pay levels and targets that are within the range of plus or minus 20% of median for both data points; and       Assessed the resulting composition of each peer group,  to ensure they reflected our executive-level talent markets that require similar skills and attributes to Harley-Davidson.

The tables below outline the 2018 peer group and the removals we made to the resulting 2019 peer group. 
Managing Compensation-Related Risks 
We design our compensation program with the understanding that while some degree of risk is necessary and appropriate, our compensation program should not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk. The Committee regularly monitors and evaluates our compensation policies and practices to ensure this is the case, and that they align with good governance practices. 
The Committee annually undertakes a compensation risk assessment to establish whether our program is successfully achieving these objectives, while paying-for-performance. The 2018 review concluded that our compensation program, particularly our cash incentive plans and long-term incentives, appropriately balance risk, pay-for-performance and the desire to focus executives on specific financial and operational measures. The Committee believes our program does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking, nor does it create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
We have adopted the following policies and agreements to further the goals of the executive compensation program and underpin our program with robust governance practices. The Committee believes these are appropriate and reflect the expectations of our shareholders while providing for clear alignment between the interests of executives and those of our shareholders. 
Clawback 
The Committee believes it makes good business sense to reserve the right to recoup previously paid compensation or adjust credited compensation in certain circumstances. It applies in the event that the Board of Directors or an appropriate Board Committee determines that any fraud or intentional misconduct by an executive officer was a contributing factor to Harley-Davidson having to

 restate any financial statements that we have filed with the SEC due to the Company's material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. If that occurs, then the Board or the Committee may, in its discretion and to the extent permitted by governing law, require the Company to seek reimbursement or forfeiture of any eligible compensation paid or credited to or earned by such executive officer. 
Compensation subject to forfeiture will be any bonuses paid or credited to, or any other incentive compensation earned by, an executive officer in excess of the amounts that would have been paid or credited to, or earned by, such executive officer during the three-year period preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare the restatement based directly on the restated financial results. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
To reinforce the link between the long-term interests of our executives and all stakeholders, including our shareholders, we require directors and executives to own a minimum amount of our common stock.

Option repricing 
Under our stock plan, the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options is prohibited. 
Maximum caps and ability to reduce awards 
Our annual cash incentive plans provide that the Committee may reduce awards that executives would otherwise earn by up to 50%, and there is a cap on all maximum cash payouts. Under our long-term incentive plan, there is a maximum cap on the level of vesting that can be achieved relative to the initial number of shares granted, although the value of awards remains subject to upward and downward movement in our share price. 
Anti-hedging and pledging 
Given certain forms of hedging and pledging protect the individual from the full risks associated with share ownership, directors and employees are prohibited from any hedging or pledging transactions with respect to Company securities. This maximizes the alignment of interests with our stakeholders and minimizes the risk of executives making decisions that are not in the sustainable long-term interests of Harley-Davidson.

2018 Compensation Decisions and Outcomes 
An Overview of Performance in 2018 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 During 2018, revenue, net income and EPS were up compared to 2017 despite a very challenging environment.   HDMCs operating income was down behind significant investment in our manufacturing  optimization plan, incremental tariffs and the expense of recalls. HDFS saw record results with operating income up 5.8%.   Other strategic achievements and areas of progress included the following:       All 2018 milestones under the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan  were achieved,       Cash from operations was up over $200 million, a 20% increase  over 2017;       Our manufacturing optimization remained on track, with 2018 costs  lower than originally expected;       There were over 50,000 more  H-D riders in the U.S. at the end of 2018;       HDFS continued to contribute to new rider growth, with the launch  of new products focused on providing financing to first-time buyers;       International retail generated modest growth, at 0.4%, with 9.8%  growth in emerging markets;       56 international dealerships were opened, providing us more  opportunities to connect with the global consumer;       There was continued growth in our online and e-commerce sales, with double-digit growth in sales on H-D.com and  online retail introductions on Amazon in the U.S. and Chinas T-Mall;       Expanded marketing efforts focused on growing our brand among  targeted demographics in both live and digital forums;       HDFS continued to support the sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, with a record share of the U.S. retail finance market;   Overall, this performance resulted in above target outcome under the short-term incentive plan  with positive scores on three of the four measures. Net income lagged the target but exceeded the threshold expectation despite the decline that the U.S. industry has been experiencing. Performance share plan awards related to the 2016 through 2018  performance period vested below target at 66.3% of target. This reflected below target performance on two of the three measures and on-target performance with respect to the third.

Other strategic achievements and areas of progress included the following:       All 2018 milestones under the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan  were achieved,       Cash from operations was up over $200 million, a 20% increase  over 2017;       Our manufacturing optimization remained on track, with 2018 costs  lower than originally expected;       There were over 50,000 more  H-D riders in the U.S. at the end of 2018;       HDFS continued to contribute to new rider growth, with the launch  of new products focused on providing financing to first-time buyers;       International retail generated modest growth, at 0.4%, with 9.8%  growth in emerging markets;       56 international dealerships were opened, providing us more  opportunities to connect with the global consumer;       There was continued growth in our online and e-commerce sales, with double-digit growth in sales on H-D.com and  online retail introductions on Amazon in the U.S. and Chinas T-Mall;       Expanded marketing efforts focused on growing our brand among  targeted demographics in both live and digital forums;       HDFS continued to support the sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, with a record share of the U.S. retail finance market;   Overall, this performance resulted in above target outcome under the short-term incentive plan  with positive scores on three of the four measures. Net income lagged the target but exceeded the threshold expectation despite the decline that the U.S. industry has been experiencing. Performance share plan awards related to the 2016 through 2018  performance period vested below target at 66.3% of target.

HDMCs operating income was down behind significant investment in our manufacturing  optimization plan, incremental tariffs and the expense of recalls. HDFS saw record results with operating income up 5.8%.   Other strategic achievements and areas of progress included the following:       All 2018 milestones under the More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan  were achieved,       Cash from operations was up over $200 million, a 20% increase  over 2017;       Our manufacturing optimization remained on track, with 2018 costs  lower than originally expected;       There were over 50,000 more  H-D riders in the U.S. at the end of 2018;       HDFS continued to contribute to new rider growth, with the launch  of new products focused on providing financing to first-time buyers;       International retail generated modest growth, at 0.4%, with 9.8%  growth in emerging markets;       56 international dealerships were opened, providing us more  opportunities to connect with the global consumer;       There was continued growth in our online and e-commerce sales, with double-digit growth in sales on H-D.com and  online retail introductions on Amazon in the U.S. and Chinas T-Mall;       Expanded marketing efforts focused on growing our brand among  targeted demographics in both live and digital forums;       HDFS continued to support the sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, with a record share of the U.S. retail finance market;   Overall, this performance resulted in above target outcome under the short-term incentive plan  with positive scores on three of the four measures. Net income lagged the target but exceeded the threshold expectation despite the decline that the U.S. industry has been experiencing. Performance share plan awards related to the 2016 through 2018  performance period vested below target at 66.3% of target. This reflected below target performance on two of the three measures and on-target performance with respect to the third.

We explain the compensation of these NEOs in 2018 in the following sections and in the Summary Compensation Table that follows. 
Base Salary 
The Committee undertakes an annual review of NEO salaries to determine whether salaries should be adjusted. In making this determination, the Committee considers a broad range of factors when setting salary including market levels in our compensation peer group around median, individual performance, experience, job scope, impact, accomplishments, general business performance and economic conditions. 
In light of the combined business performance and economic climate, the Committee determined that there would be no increases to NEO salaries in 2018.

2018 Short-Term Incentive Plan 
For 2018, the Committee approved a revised approach to our short-term incentive plan, which assesses performance under a single plan against clearly measurable financial and strategic measures. 
If we did not achieve the minimum level of performance, then there would be no payout. If we achieved the minimum level of performance, then the threshold payout was 50% of the target opportunity; performance at or above the upper end of performance goals would result in a payout of 200% of the target opportunity. 
In February 2018, as part of the annual target setting process, the Committee reviewed and approved the amount of compensation that we would pay to each NEO under the short-term incentive plan, expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary if the actual company performance resulted in a payout at target for 2018. With the removal of the Leadership STIP, the Committee increased the short-term incentive plan and long-term incentive plan targets to maintain market competitiveness within the range of plus or minus 20% of the 50th percentile, which resulted in greater emphasis on long-term incentives than in prior years. The Committee approved the following target bonus opportunities for the NEOs with respect to 2018 performance.

If Harley-Davidson did not achieve a minimum level of net income of at least $409 million, then no payouts, regardless of performance under other financial measures, would be made. In 2018, net income of $552.7 million exceeded the threshold. Performance with respect to the other measures was as follows:

[END TABLE]
In light of the decline in our stock price in 2018, the Committee carefully considered whether the outcome under this plan and the performance that it rewarded was appropriate. The Committee concluded that the strong strategic achievements coupled with the Company's ability to maintain the financial health of the business in an extremely challenging environment sufficiently warranted the payout that was earned under the plan. 
This resulted in an overall payout of 135.1% of target.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Equity-based awards provide a direct alignment of interests with our shareholders, given the exposure to upward and downward movement in Harley-Davidson's share price over the long-term. For our executive officers, we make long-term incentive awards in the form of two types of equity-based awards that enable the Committee to achieve a combination of objectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance shares enable the Committee to incentivize and reward performance in areas critical to our success in achieving  our More Roads to Harley-Davidson plan and 2027 objectives; and

• Restricted stock units help us retain our senior executives, whose experience is critical to the successful execution of our  plans and strategies.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee determined each NEO's target value of long-term incentive opportunity, which we express as a percentage of base salary, based on the competitive market 50th percentile plus or minus 20%. Accordingly, with input from Meridian, the Committee approved an increase in the CEO's target value from 455% of base salary to 485% of base salary for 2018. Based on recommendations from Mr. Levatich informed by competitive market data, we increased Mr. Olin's target for 2018 from 239% of base salary to 260% of base salary; Ms. Kumbier's target value for 2018 from 220% of base salary to 240% of base salary; Mr. Hund's target for 2018 from 215% of base salary to 235% of base salary and Mr. Jones's target for 2018 from 165% of base salary to 185% of base salary. 
We converted the target value of long-term incentive opportunity for each NEO into an award of performance shares and an award of restricted stock units. For this conversion, we valued each performance share and each restricted stock unit at an amount equal to the closing price of a share of our stock on the date of grant.

The Committee decided to modify the mix of performance shares (from 67% to 60%) and restricted stock units (from 33% to 40%) following the removal of the second component of our short-term incentive plan in 2018, the Leadership STIP. In addition, with the removal of the Leadership STIP, the Committee increased the short-term incentive plan and long-term incentive plan targets to maintain market competitiveness, while still remaining within the range we target, which resulted in greater emphasis on long-term incentives than in prior years. The chart below shows the transfer of the value of the Leadership STIP with one-third moving to the short-term incentive plan and two-thirds moving to the long-term incentive plan. 
2018 Performance Share Awards 
Performance shares allow the executive to earn a specified number of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance period (2018 through 2020) that will range between 0% and 200% of the initial shares awarded. As a result, the number of performance shares an NEO earns is based on company performance, and the value that the NEO realizes is tied to the stock price when the shares vest at the end of the performance period. To the extent awards vest, the participant will also receive the accumulated dividends that have accrued over the performance period, in direct proportion to the number of performance shares that actually vest.

Why we use Net Income in both the short-term and long-term incentive plan 
We use net income as a measure in both the short-term incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan because we believe it is a driver of shareholder value. The Committee establishes meaningful goals for performance-based compensation including performance measures, measure weighting and thresholds, targets and maximums for incentive plan compensation. We set targets based on our operating plan and intend that they will drive our strategy.

2018 Restricted Share Awards 
Restricted stock unit awards allow the executive to earn a specified number of shares of our common stock at the end of a restricted period. Awards vest in three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date subject to continued employment. During the vesting period, the recipient is eligible to receive dividend equivalents on a real-time basis in the same amount as dividends that are declared and paid quarterly on each share of our stock. The Committee believes that restricted stock unit awards complement our use of performance shares by providing an effective and valuable tool to attract and retain executives. 
Under the vesting rules, a recipient who has reached the age of 55, is eligible for retirement and retires from the Company will have all awards that were granted 12 or more months prior to the date of retirement vested upon retirement. 
In determining the number of restricted stock units to be granted, the Committee takes into account individual performance ratings for the prior year. We grant restricted stock units to an executive in a year only if he or she met or exceeded objective and subjective performance standards that applied to him or her in the preceding year. For purposes of the 2018 grants, the Committee determined that all NEOs met or exceeded applicable performance standards in 2017. 
2018 Retention Awards 
From time-to-time, the Committee deems it necessary to consider the grant of awards outside of our annual grants. During February 2018, the Committee granted 10,000 restricted stock units for Lawrence Hund, the President and Chief Operating Officer of HDFS. The Committee approved the award with a grant date fair value of $475,000. The Committee approved it as an incentive to Mr. Hund, in recognition of his continued strong performance and to provide a retention incentive for Mr. Hund, given the importance of HDFS to our overall business strategy. The restricted stock units will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date with no acceleration should Mr. Hund choose to retire before then, so Mr. Hund must be an active employee on the third anniversary of the grant to receive the award. 
Payout of the 2016 Performance Share Awards 
In 2016, the Committee approved grants of performance shares which, subject to performance, were eligible for vesting in a range between 0% and 300% of the initial award amount. For subsequent awards, we decreased the maximum opportunity to 200%.

 Performance was assessed against three performance measures, tied to our areas of long-term strategic focus. In February 2016, the Committee approved the new rider measure under which we would pay out at 100% for a one percentage point improvement in new riders purchasing new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S. in the last year of the performance cycle. In November 2016, we discovered significant integrity issues underlying the third-party data that we used to set the threshold, target and maximum amounts for this measure. After the data provider resolved the data integrity issues, we recalculated the threshold, target and maximum amounts, still maintaining a one percentage point improvement to payout at target.

The performance period for the awards that we granted in 2016 ended on December 31, 2018. We paid the awards in February 2019 at 66.3% of target. 
Other Elements of Compensation 
The final elements of our executive compensation program are the benefits and limited executive perquisites that we provide. We generally offer benefits in a similar form and manner to our other salaried employees, with a goal across the Company of being competitive in the markets in which we compete for talent.

HDI Deferred Compensation Plan     A non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for salaried employees in  which a group of highly-compensated employees (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code) is eligible to participate, including the NEOs.   Under our non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan, we pay participants amounts that would have been accrued or payable under  the Retirement Savings Plan if statutory limits that apply to that plan as a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code had not been applicable.   Under the terms of this plan, participants can defer a portion of their base salary and a portion of their annual STIP payment. If a participant in this plan makes an  election to defer eligible compensation, and there are statutory limits on such participant's ability to defer at least 6% of eligible compensation into the qualified employee Retirement Savings Plan, then the participant will also  receive company matching contributions in this plan that would have been made in the qualified plan if no statutory limit had been applicable.   We believe earnings on amounts deferred reflect the returns available in the market because investment options in the Deferred Compensation Plan that are  participant-directed are similar to those that exist in our 401(k) plan. This plan is structured to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Each of our NEOs is eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan.   All NEOs participate in this plan.

If a participant in this plan makes an  election to defer eligible compensation, and there are statutory limits on such participant's ability to defer at least 6% of eligible compensation into the qualified employee Retirement Savings Plan, then the participant will also  receive company matching contributions in this plan that would have been made in the qualified plan if no statutory limit had been applicable.   We believe earnings on amounts deferred reflect the returns available in the market because investment options in the Deferred Compensation Plan that are  participant-directed are similar to those that exist in our 401(k) plan. This plan is structured to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Each of our NEOs is eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan.   All NEOs participate in this plan.

Life Insurance     We provide life insurance benefits to the executives that are available only in the event of their death  during active employment with the Company. The amount of life insurance benefits ranges from one and one-half to three times an executive's annual base salary, depending on salary band. We also  reimburse executives for taxes on income that tax law imputes to executives related to the provision of life insurance in excess of $50,000.   All NEOs participate in this plan.

Post-Retirement Life Insurance     Historically, we provided certain executives, including the NEOs, who retire after reaching age 55, and  after attaining five or more years of service, a benefit in lieu of providing post-retirement life insurance. This consists of a payment equal to two years' base salary at retirement. The executive is responsible for all taxes associated  with this payment. The plan has been closed to new participants since December 31, 2015.   Currently, Messrs. Olin and Hund are eligible to receive this benefit upon their retirement. The remaining NEOs, Mr. Levatich, Ms. Kumbier and  Mr. Jones, become eligible for this benefit after reaching age 55.

Additional Information 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deductibility of compensation that we pay to certain covered employees, generally our NEOs, to $1,000,000 in any year. Prior to the changes made to Section 162(m) by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this limitation did not apply to performance-based compensation if certain conditions were met and also excluded compensation to our chief financial officer. Starting with 2018, performance-based compensation is generally subject to the $1,000,000 limit, and the list of covered employees was modified to include any person who served as our CEO or CFO at any point during the fiscal year, any other person whose compensation was otherwise required to be included in our proxy statement by reason of being among the three highest compensated officers for the fiscal year, and any other person who was a covered employee for any preceding fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2016. Qualifying performance-based compensation that we pay pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified will continue to be exempt from the deduction limit under a grandfathering rule. The Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by not restricting its discretion and flexibility in structuring compensation, even though doing that may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Because many different factors influence a well-rounded, comprehensive executive compensation program, some of the compensation we provide to our executive officers is likely not to be fully deductible for tax purposes due to Section 162(m). 
Equity Award and Grant Practices 
We make awards of equity to certain employees, including our NEOs and directors, under an established process that the Committee has approved using a shareholder-approved stock plan. 
Annual equity awards to employees historically have taken place in February after the release of fourth-quarter earnings at which time the "window" for effecting transactions in our stock is generally open for those employees who may, through their job responsibilities, have access to material non-public information. 
Off-cycle equity award grants may only be effective on dates during an open window period and occur after the CEO determines that an individual is deserving of an award because (i) an eligible employee is a recent hire; (ii) an employee has excelled in his/her role; (iii) an eligible employee is promoted to a new position (which is stock eligible); (iv) an eligible employee is highly valued and management wants to retain the individual; or (v) an eligible employee was inadvertently omitted from the annual award list. 
Tally Sheets 
The Committee reviews tally sheets every year that are comprehensive and show the full range of compensation under a variety of employment scenarios. The Committee believes the annual review of tally sheets is helpful and considers them as part of its deliberations regarding executive pay every year. 
Employment Contracts 
We do not enter into employment contracts with executives that provide for ongoing terms of employment. 
Transition Agreements and Change In Control 
On December 31, 2018, we had transition agreements with Messrs. Levatich, Hund, Olin, and Jones, and Ms. Kumbier, which become effective upon a change of control of Harley-Davidson, Inc. as defined in their transition agreements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
In the agreements with these NEOs, to the extent that payments to these executives under these agreements would be considered "excess parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the payments will be reduced to a point at which they are no longer considered excess parachute payments or the executive will receive the full payment and be personally liable for the excise tax, whichever produces the larger after-tax benefit to the executive. 
The transition agreements do not provide for the payment of an excise tax gross-up or any benefits in the event the executive voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason after a change of control. There is no immediate vesting of equity awards upon a change of control for NEOs who are parties to transition agreements. 
We believe the circumstances that entitle an individual to payments upon termination of employment following a change of control strike the appropriate balance between protecting the interests of our shareholders and our executives. The table in the "Payments Made Upon Termination—Change of Control" section provides estimates of the amounts of compensation payable to each eligible NEO, if any, upon a change of control and termination of the executive. The assumptions we used to calculate those amounts accompany the Change of Control table. 
Executive Severance 
All NEOs are covered under our Executive Severance Policy that provides for a cash severance of 24 months of base salary and 18 months continuation of certain employee benefits, such as life insurance, medical, dental, vision, as well as outplacement and financial planning benefits, if we terminate employment for reasons other than for cause. To receive a severance payment under this policy, the executive must agree to certain restrictive covenants and execute a general release of claims against the Company.

(1)  We calculated the compensation related to stock (restricted stock units and performance shares) based on the grant date  fair value of an award. We based the grant date fair value of restricted stock unit and performance share awards on the market price of the underlying stock as of the date of grant (which considers the value of dividend equivalents that the holder  is entitled to receive). The performance share award value included in the summary compensation table is based on achieving the performance objectives at target. The maximum performance share award value for 2018 grants, based on the grant date fair  value per performance share, is 200% of the target amount, which equates to the following amounts based on our stock price on the date of grant: Mr. Levatich - $ $6,263,825, Mr. Olin - $ $2,095,225, Ms. Kumbier - $1,900,855,  Mr. Hund - $1,735,270 and Mr. Jones - $1,251,625.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  In November 2018, the Human Resources Committee approved the STIP relating to 2019 performance. Under this plan, each NEO  has the potential to earn the estimated future payouts that we disclose above during 2019, which we would pay out in February 2020. We include further details regarding these plans, including information on performance criteria, in the  "Short-Term Incentive Plan" section of the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts shown represent the threshold, target and maximum payouts under performance shares that we granted to NEOs in  2018. The performance shares allow NEOs to earn a specified number of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance period that will range between 0% and 200% of the initial award amount. The initial award amount for each  executive's 2018 performance share award is a stated number of performance shares, which is the target amount shown in the table. The number of shares of our stock that the NEO will earn will be determined at the end of a three-year performance  period. The performance measures applicable to the performance shares that we granted in 2018 are based on Cumulative Net Income (weighted at 50%) and HDMC Average Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) (weighted at 50%). These measures are discussed in  more detail under "Long-Term Incentive Plan" in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." The amount of shares the NEO earns is based on performance and the value that the NEO realizes is based on our stock price when earned  shares are delivered. To the extent that these awards vest, the participant will receive the accumulated dividends that have accrued over the performance period in direct proportion to the number of performance shares that actually vest.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Restricted stock unit awards allow NEOs to receive shares of our common stock in the future only after the awards vest,  which will occur only if the individual remains an employee through the vesting date or certain other circumstances apply. The restricted stock unit awards vest in three equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date. During the  vesting period, the recipient is eligible to receive dividend equivalents on a current basis on each restricted stock unit of the same value as dividends that are declared and paid quarterly on each share of stock. Under the vesting rules of our  restricted stock unit awards, a recipient who is at least 55 years old, eligible for retirement, and retires from the company will have all awards that were granted 12 or more months prior to the date of retirement vest upon retirement.

Harley-Davidson CEO Pay Ratio for 2018 
To comply with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following disclosure regarding the ratio of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer for the year ended December 31, 2018. We identified our median employee for 2018 using the following methodology: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We identified each individual that we employed globally on October 15, 2018. We used October 15 as our  determination date, rather than last year's determination date of October 12, so that the date aligned with the end of a U.S. pay cycle, which made it easier for us to gather the required payroll information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We then compared the base salary or base wages that we paid to each individual in our employee population during 2018. We  annualized the base salary for any individual who commenced work with us after January 1, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We identified approximately 240 employees to whom we paid approximately the same base compensation during 2018. From that  group of employees, we conducted a random sample to identify a sub-group of employees from which to select our median employee. We then used assumptions that we considered reasonable based on our knowledge of  our employee population to select an employee from the sub-group as the median employee that we thought was most representative of our employee population.  
[END TABLE]
We calculated such median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 in the same way that we calculated total compensation for each of our NEOs that appear in the Summary Compensation Table above. Our median employee's total compensation was $74,359, and our CEO's total compensation (as reported in the Summary Compensation Table) was $9,149,692, resulting in a ratio of the median employee's compensation to our CEO's compensation of approximately 1:123.

Narrative to Pension Benefits table 
We maintain the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan which is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan. Under this plan, our salaried employees (excluding employees of HDFS and certain other subsidiaries, such as Mr. Hund), including Messrs. Levatich and Olin and Ms. Kumbier, are generally eligible to retire with unreduced benefits at age 62 or later. Mr. Jones is not eligible to participate in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan as we closed the plan to new participants in 2006. 
Benefits are based upon monthly "final average earnings" as defined in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan. The monthly benefit is 1.2% of the final average earnings plus 0.4% of the final average earnings in excess of Social Security covered compensation multiplied by years of service. 
For each eligible named executive officer, final average monthly earnings equal one-twelfth of the highest average annual total compensation (consisting of base salary, annual bonus and annual non-equity incentive compensation as shown in the Summary Compensation Table) paid over five highest consecutive total compensation years within the last ten years of service prior to the participant's retirement or other date of termination. Compensation under any long-term incentive plan that we maintain, including equity or cash plans, is not eligible compensation for purposes of the pension or pension benefit restoration plans. 
Vesting under the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan occurs upon the earlier of five years of service or age 65. An employee who retires after age 55 and before age 62 with a minimum of five years of service will receive an actuarially reduced benefit under the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan. The surviving spouse of an employee who is eligible for early retirement or which is vested at death is also entitled to certain benefits under the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan. 
We adopted the Pension Benefit Restoration Plan pursuant to which we will pay participants amounts that exceed certain limitations the Internal Revenue Code imposes on benefits payable under the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan as a plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and to counteract the adverse effect that participation in the Harley-Davidson deferred compensation plan may have on benefits payable under the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan. Approximately 100 employees participate in the Restoration Plan. Executives in the plan as of December 31, 2008, made an irrevocable election to receive their benefit from the Restoration Plan as either a single lump sum payment or a monthly payment. 
We computed the present value of each NEO's accumulated benefit in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan and Pension Benefit Restoration Plan using the same assumptions and measurement date that we used for financial reporting purposes for our 2018 financial statements. For each active named executive officer that was eligible to receive benefits as of the end of the year, we assumed a retirement age of 62, which is the earliest age at which an NEO may retire under the relevant plans without any reduction to benefits. 
Certain executives are entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to two years' salary upon retirement at or after age 55 and 5 years of service with no provision for taxes. We adopted this defined benefit in lieu of providing post-retirement life insurance. Mr. Hund and Mr. Olin were the only NEOs who were eligible to receive this benefit as of December 31, 2018. The other NEOs were not entitled to this benefit as of December 31, 2018, because they would not have satisfied the eligibility requirements as of that date. This plan has been closed to new participants since December 31, 2015.

(1)  Executive contributions to these plans represent compensation from salary and  non-equity incentive plans that NEOs earned but elected to defer. The entire executive contribution is therefore included in the NEO's compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Employees of HDMC hired prior to August 1, 2006, including Messrs. Levatich and Olin and Ms. Kumbier, receive a  company matching contribution of up to 50% of their deferred compensation plan contributions (including contributions to the company's 401(k) plans and its non-qualified deferred compensation plans) on  the first 6% of cash compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan pay) that was deferred. Employees of HDMC hired after August 1, 2006, including Mr. Jones, receive a matching contribution of  up to 75% of their deferred compensation plan contributions (including contributions to the company's 401(k) plans and its non-qualified deferred compensation plans) on the first 6% of cash compensation  (salary and short-term incentive plan pay) that was deferred. In addition, employees with a date of hire or rehire on or after August 1, 2006, and who are not covered under the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan after August 1, 2006,  may receive an additional employer contribution of 4% of their eligible pay. The total amount of employer contributions for each eligible NEO that is included in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan is  equal to the total contribution less the amount contributed to each NEO's 401(k) account. All amounts shown as registrant contributions are included in the NEO's compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table. Employees of  Harley-Davidson Financial Services, including Mr. Hund, do not receive a matching contribution on deferred compensation plan contributions.

(3)  Executives have the option of allocating their deferred compensation balances across several different independent  third-party investment vehicles. No amounts of aggregate earnings for the last fiscal year or for prior years have been included in the Summary Compensation Table.

(4)  Amounts included in the aggregate balance that have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table for previous years for  each NEO are as follows: Mr. Levatich - $ 955,993, Mr. Olin - $ 1,326,282, Ms. Kumbier - $ 131,505, Mr. Hund - $ 2,113,955, and Mr. Jones - $ 597,684.  
[END TABLE]
We include a description of the HDI Deferred Compensation Plan in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
PAYMENTS MADE UPON TERMINATION 
Regardless of the manner in which an NEO's employment terminates, he or she may be entitled to receive amounts earned during his or her term of employment. Such amounts may include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• non-equity incentive compensation earned during the fiscal year;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amounts contributed under our Deferred Compensation Plan;

Change of Control 
We have transition agreements with Messrs. Levatich, Olin, Hund, and Jones and Ms. Kumbier. Each agreement provides that, if we terminate the individual's employment for any reason (other than for cause) within two years after a change of control, then such individual will receive a cash payment and certain other benefits. In addition, among other events, voluntary termination by the executive of his or her employment for "good reason" within two years after a change of control would entitle the executive to the benefits under the agreement. We describe the transition agreements more fully in the section "Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Employment and Transition Agreements." 
Our incentive stock plans also contain provisions that apply if there is a change of control. Equity awards that we made under our 2009 and 2014 Incentive Stock Plans to an executive who was then a party to a transition agreement do not become fully vested upon a change of control (but may become vested if we terminate the individual's employment for any reason other than cause within two years after a change of control). With respect to grants through 2018, all other restricted stock awards, performance share awards, restricted stock units and option grants that we made under our 2009 and 2014 Incentive Stock Plans and predecessor plans that are unvested become fully vested upon a change of control. Beginning in 2019, all long-term incentive awards have a double-trigger vesting provision.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at least two-thirds of the total number of directors either serving on the date of  the agreement or approved by those serving as of the date of the agreement or successors they have approved determines immediately before a proposed action is taken that the action will constitute a change of control event (and the action is  subsequently taken).  
[END TABLE]
The table below presents estimates of the amounts of compensation payable to each NEO upon a change of control and termination of the executive in a manner that entitles the executive to cash severance. The amounts shown assume that such change of control and termination were both effective as of December 31, 2018. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of a change of control or the executive's termination. These amounts are in addition to amounts that an NEO would be entitled to receive under our pension plans as well as vested amounts of deferred compensation that are fully disclosed for each NEO in the "Pension Benefits" and "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" tables, respectively.

(a)  For (Messrs. Levatich, Olin and Hund), the cash severance reflects the product of three times the sum of the NEO's  highest annual base pay in the preceding five years plus the higher of the NEO's bonus opportunity (at target) for the year in which the change of control event occurs or the highest annual bonus in the preceding five years. For  Ms. Kumbier and Mr. Jones the cash severance reflects the product of two times the sum of the NEO's highest annual base pay in the preceding five years plus two times the current target bonus. Under the transition agreements, to the  extent that payments to executives would be considered "excess parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the payments will be reduced to a point at which they are no longer considered excess  parachute payments or the executive will receive the full payment and be personally liable for the excise tax, whichever produces the larger after-tax benefit to the executive. In these agreements, there are  no provisions for an excise tax gross-up. Amounts in the table assume that the executives received the full payments that the transition agreements contemplate without reduction.

(b)  For each NEO, the interrupted bonus reflects the higher of the NEO's target STIP opportunity for 2018 or the actual  bonus earned in 2018 on the assumption that the actual bonus for 2018 would not have been determined had the change of control occurred December 31, 2018. Without the benefit of a transition agreement, there is no entitlement to any amount  under the STIP upon a change of control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(c)  Pursuant to our transition agreements with Messrs. Levatich, Olin and Hund, upon a termination following a change of  control in a manner that entitles the executive to cash severance, a NEO is entitled to receive three years of pension service credit for those who participate in the pension plan (but not beyond age 65) based on assumed compensation.  Ms. Kumbier and Mr. Jones are not eligible for additional retirement benefits upon a change of control event. Messrs. Levatich, Olin and Hund are entitled to three years of continued coverage in our health and welfare benefit programs and  up to three years of outplacement services. Ms. Kumbier and Mr. Jones are entitled to two years of continued coverage in our health and welfare benefit programs and a lump sum payment for outplacement services and financial planning  assistance. We estimated the amounts in the table relating to continued coverage in our health and welfare benefit programs and outplacement services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d)  Pursuant to our transition agreements, upon termination following a change of control in a manner that entitles the  executive to cash severance, Messrs. Levatich and Olin would be entitled to three years of pension service credit (but not beyond age 65) based on assumed compensation. We calculated the present values of qualified and nonqualified pension plan  benefits for Messrs. Levatich and Olin using the same actuarial assumptions that we used for the Pension Benefits Table. Ms. Kumbier and Mr. Jones are not eligible for additional retirement benefits upon a change of control event.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(e)  Pursuant to the transition agreement with Mr. Hund, because he is not eligible to participate in our defined benefit  pension plan, he would be entitled to certain other retirement-related benefits upon termination following a change of control in a manner that entitles him to cash severance. Mr. Hund would be entitled to the value of three years of the  company contribution to the Harley-Davidson Financial Services 401(k) Plan, which is the maximum of $10,000 per year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(f)  For each NEO, amounts reflect the value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and unvested options awards that  become vested upon termination following a change of control. The definition of change of control under our stock plans is essentially the same as in the transition agreements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(g)  We calculated the value of the unvested stock options based upon the difference between the aggregate market value of the  shares of common stock underlying the unvested stock options and the aggregate exercise price that the named executive officer would be required to pay upon exercise of those stock options. We calculated the value of the unvested shares of  restricted stock and unvested restricted stock units held by each NEO based upon the aggregate market value of the related shares. We used a price of $34.128 per share to determine market value in both of these calculations, which was the closing  price of our common stock on December 31, 2018, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(h)  For each named executive officer, amounts reflect the target value of cash-based long-term incentive awards, performance  share awards and the value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and unvested options awards that become vested upon a change of control regardless of whether the executive's employment is actually terminated. Equity awards that we made  to Messrs. Levatich, Olin and Hund under our 2009 and 2014 Incentive Stock Plans do not vest upon a change of control (but may become vested if we terminate the executive's employment for any reason other than cause within two years after a  change of control). Ms. Kumbier and Mr. Jones became parties to a transition agreement in 2018, and equity awards that we made to them, prior the time they signed the transition agreements, under our 2009 and 2014 Incentive Stock Plans  will vest upon a change of control without regard to termination of employment resulting from such change of control.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Severance 
Our Executive Severance Policy, which applies to a subset of the senior leaders, including the CEO and the other NEOs, provides for a cash severance benefit of between 12 and 24 months of base pay and 18 months continuation of certain employee benefits, such as life insurance, medical benefits, and limited outplacement benefits if we terminate employment for reasons other than for cause. To receive a severance payment under this policy, the executive must agree to a number of restrictive covenants and execute a general release of claims against the company. 
The table below presents estimates of the amounts of compensation payable to each NEO under the Executive Severance Policy assuming a termination absent a change of control for any reason other than cause, death or disability. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the executive's termination.

Vesting of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
We awarded restricted stock and restricted stock units to NEOs, and NEOs earn the related shares when the restrictions on the awards lapse, but only if the individual remains an employee or certain other circumstances apply. In some circumstances, a pro-rata portion of the shares will vest based on a ratio of actual service to the requisite service period. This is the case for all awards if the NEO dies or becomes disabled. For certain awards, if the NEO is 55 years of age or older and elects to retire more than one year after the date

 of the grant of the award, all unvested shares or units under that award will automatically vest upon retirement. In addition, other awards vest fully if we terminate the NEO other than for cause. In general, "cause" means conviction of or plea of no contest to a felony, willful misconduct that is materially and demonstrably detrimental to the company, willful refusal to perform duties consistent with the NEO's office, position or status with the company or other conduct or inaction that the Human Resources Committee determines constitutes cause. Finally, as we disclose in the table above that presents the amounts payable to each NEO upon a change of control, certain restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards also vest fully on a change of control. 
The following table reflects, for each NEO, the value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that become vested upon termination of the NEO's employment for each of the reasons indicated in the table assuming that such termination occurred on December 31, 2018. The value is based upon the aggregate market value of the shares that would vest in each instance. We used a price of $34.12 per share to determine market value, which was the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange. Amounts that we reflect in this table are in addition to any amounts the NEO may be entitled to receive under the Executive Severance Policy.

(1)  While terms for certain awards provide that the individual will forfeit any shares that are not vested if we terminate the  individual, upon such a termination the individual could elect to treat the termination as a qualified retirement if he or she were eligible. There is no pro-rata vesting based on performance or, in the first  year after grant, due to retirement. As a result, the awards give the NEO a strong incentive to remain with the company.  
[END TABLE]
Payments Made Upon Death or Disability 
If an NEO dies while employed, in addition to the benefits to which we refer immediately following the heading "Payments Made Upon Termination" above and the amounts we disclose above relating to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, the NEO will receive payments under our death benefits. Our death benefits provide that each NEO is entitled to three times annual base salary in the event of his or her death while actively employed, which we would generally satisfy out of proceeds of life insurance that we maintain. For each NEO, we report premiums that we paid for this life insurance as part of "All Other Compensation" in the "Summary Compensation Table." In addition, we maintain long-term disability plans in which NEOs may participate on a voluntary basis on the same terms as other salaried employees. There is no company contribution toward the cost of this benefit. 
Under the form of our transition agreement, if the NEO's death occurs during employment, then no benefits are payable under the agreement. In addition, under all forms of our transition agreement, if an NEO dies after a termination that entitles the NEO to a cash payment, or if an NEO's death during active employment after a change of control entitles the NEO's estate to a cash payment, the health benefit coverage for the NEO's eligible dependents will continue until the earlier to occur of one year following the executive's death or three years following the executive's termination. All other welfare benefit coverage will cease at the date of the NEO's death. 
Treatment of Certain Benefits Upon Retirement 
For compensation purposes, we generally define "retirement" as separation from service on or after attainment of age 55. When an individual who satisfies these criteria leaves service, we consider him or her a retiree for purposes of certain compensation and benefits programs. An executive who has received a cash-based long-term incentive award or a performance share award will receive a payout on a pro-rata basis for each award that we granted to the executive before his or her retirement date. The payment amount under each of these awards is based upon the actual months of employment since the date of the award divided by the 36-month life of the award. Actual payments will only be made upon the completion of the performance period. An executive will receive a payout with respect to a STIP award relating to the year in which he or she retires on a pro-rata basis based upon their actual pay during the year in which they retire and the actual STIP performance of the company. Equity awards granted at least 12 months prior to the date of retirement vest on the date of retirement. These benefits are in addition to those that we disclose above under "Pension Benefits." 
As of December 31, 2018, two of our NEOs, Messrs. Olin and Hund, were eligible to retire and would receive certain benefits (as described above) upon retirement. Assuming that they had retired effective that date, they would have been entitled to receive (1) payment in lieu of retiree life insurance as reflected in the table that appears above under "Pension Benefits," (2) value in respect of the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units as reflected in the table that appears above under "Vesting of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units" and (3) pro-rata payout under the 2016 through 2018 performance share awards, 2017 through

(2)  In August 2002, the Board of Directors approved stock ownership guidelines which the Board revised most recently in  February 2016. In February 2016, the Board approved a change in the director stock ownership guidelines to require a non-employee director to hold 500% of the value of his or her annual cash retainer in the  form of stock or stock equivalents. This change was effective May 1, 2016. Each non-employee director has until May 2021 to accumulate the appropriate number of shares.

(3)  Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of share units, each representing  the value of one share of our stock. The payment of share units is deferred, at the election of each non-employee director, until the first anniversary of each respective grant date or the time a non-employee director ceases to serve as a director, and share units are payable at that time in actual shares of our stock. The compensation related to share unit awards has been calculated based on the grant date  fair value of the award. The fair value of a share unit is based on the market price of a share of stock on the date of grant.

Narrative to Director Compensation table 
Directors who are our employees (currently Mr. Levatich) do not receive compensation for their services as directors. Directors who are not employees received an annual retainer fee of $110,000 in fiscal 2018. Mr. Cave received an additional $160,000 for his service as the non-executive Chairman of the Board. For serving as the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a non-employee director is entitled to receive an additional retainer fee of $15,000. For serving as the Chair of the Sustainability Committee, a non-employee director is entitled to receive an additional annual retainer fee of $10,000. The Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee and the Chair of the Human Resources Committee are each entitled to receive an additional $20,000 annual retainer fee. Other members of the Audit and Finance Committee are entitled to receive an additional $5,000 annual retainer fee. 
Pursuant to our Director Stock Plan, a non-employee director may elect to receive 0%, 50%, or 100% of the annual retainer fee to be paid in each calendar year in the form of shares of our common stock based upon the fair market value of common stock at the time of our annual meeting of shareholders. In addition, non-employee directors receive an annual grant of share units, each representing the right to receive one share of our common stock and therefore having the value of one share of our common stock. 
Also pursuant to our Director Stock Plan, directors may choose to defer the receipt of their annual retainer fees payable in cash or shares of common stock. Deferrals of fees payable in shares of common stock are credited to a share account, are treated as if invested in common stock, and ultimately will be paid in common stock. Deferrals of fees payable in cash are credited to a cash account and will earn a return based on investment options that we make available to the director and that the director selects. A director will receive his or her deferred compensation following cessation of his or her service on the Board in compliance with applicable rules regarding deferred compensation plans. 
The purpose of our Director Stock Plan is to further align the interests of outside directors with shareholders by providing for a portion of annual compensation for the directors' services in shares of common stock or share units. 
In addition, we provide to non-employee directors a clothing allowance up to $1,500 to purchase Harley-Davidson MotorClothes® apparel and accessories, along with a discount on our products that is the same discount available to all U.S. employees of HDMC. We may also provide a director with the temporary use of a motorcycle where doing so may further our business objectives.

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC reports regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our securities. Based on our review of the copies of Forms 3 and 4 (and any amendments) filed with the SEC and the written representations of our directors and executive officers, we believe that during fiscal year 2018 our directors and executive officers complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.

The Board has empowered the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to continuously review our corporate governance practices and to make recommendations to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews our Corporate Governance Policy, encourages the continuing education of Board members, provides Board members with access to senior management and defines each Board member's responsibility to attend meetings and review all pre-meeting materials. 
As part of our global compliance and ethics program, we have a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers and Board members. We also have a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to our suppliers and their agents who do work on behalf of Harley-Davidson Inc. The Code of Business Conduct reporting helpline, website and telephone numbers are designed to provide employees and suppliers with the opportunity to ask Code-related questions or report a potential Code violation throughout the world (where legally allowable). Our Vice President and Chief Legal Officer reports to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on matters relating to the company's global compliance and ethics program. We also have in effect the Conflict of Interest Process that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has approved. The Code of Business Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct, Conflict of Interest Process, Corporate Governance Policy and each of the four committee Charters appear on the Corporate Governance page of our website at http://investor.harley-davidson.com 
In addition, the Corporate Governance page of our website contains information about how our shareholders can contact Board members if they have questions or issues of concern for the Board and other information relating to the company's corporate governance. We are not including the information available through our website as a part of this Proxy Statement. 
As set forth in its Charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leads the Board in an annual review of the performance of the Board, the Board's committees and the Directors. Annually, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the independence of each director and examines all relationships, if any, a director has with the company to determine if that relationship is material. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined that one current director (Mr. Levatich) is not independent and has reviewed the very limited business relationships that one other director has with the company. We disclose this relationship in the "Certain Transactions" section. All members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent in accordance with New York Stock Exchange rules.

The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed with management its assessment of the effectiveness of Harley-Davidson's internal control system over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Management has concluded that the internal control system was effective. Additionally, Harley-Davidson's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 was audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Harley-Davidson's independent auditor for the 2018 fiscal year. 
The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed Harley-Davidson's audited financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year with management as well as with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit and Finance Committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. The Audit and Finance Committee has received written disclosures from Ernst & Young LLP regarding their independence as required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and has discussed with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP the independence of Ernst & Young LLP.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
If a shareholder intends to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders and desires to have us include that proposal in our proxy materials for that meeting under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, then the shareholder must ensure that we receive the proposal by November 30, 2019. A shareholder who otherwise intends to present business at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders must comply with the requirements set forth in our Restated Articles of Incorporation as supplemented by our By-laws. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain specific requirements with which a shareholder must comply. For example, our Restated Articles of Incorporation state that a shareholder must give written notice that complies with the Restated Articles of Incorporation as supplemented by our By-laws to our Secretary not less than 60 days before the date in 2020 corresponding to the date we released this Proxy Statement to our shareholders. Because we anticipate mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials on March 29, 2019, we must receive notice of a proposal for shareholders to consider at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders that a shareholder submits other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 no later than January 29, 2020. 
If we receive the notice after January 29, 2020, then we will consider the notice untimely and we will not have an obligation to present the proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. If the Board chooses to present a proposal that a shareholder submits other than under Rule 14a-8 at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, then the persons named in the proxies that the Board requests for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders may exercise discretionary voting power with respect to the proposal.

Q:  What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  (1) To elect ten directors to the Board of Directors; (2) to approve, by advisory vote, the compensation of our  named executive officers; (3) to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and (4) to take action upon any other business as  may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. The Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and this Proxy Statement describe these matters in more detail. In addition, members of management will  report on our 2018 performance and, once the shareholders conclude the business of the Annual Meeting, respond to shareholders' questions as time permits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who can attend the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  All shareholders of Harley-Davidson, Inc., or individuals that shareholders have duly appointed as their proxies  and guests, may attend the Annual Meeting. Appointing a proxy in response to this request will not affect a shareholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and to vote in person. To attend the Annual Meeting, please follow these instructions:   
[END TABLE]
If shares you own are registered in your name or if you own shares through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan, to enter the Annual Meeting, please bring a form of a government-issued photo identification and either (1) proof of your ownership of our common stock or (2) the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials; or if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a broker, bank or other nominee), to enter the Annual Meeting, please bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your ownership of our common stock or other proof of ownership through such broker, bank or nominee and a form of a government-issued photo identification. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What constitutes a quorum?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A majority of the 159,022,009 shares of our stock outstanding on March 15, 2019 must be present, in person or by  proxy, to provide a quorum at the Annual Meeting. If you vote, your shares will count toward satisfying the quorum requirement. If you return a proxy card or otherwise submit a proxy marked "ABSTAIN" or without voting instructions, your  shares of common stock will also count toward satisfying the quorum requirement. Also, in those instances where banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares on behalf of others have returned a proxy but could not vote the shares on particular  matters without receiving voting instructions from the beneficial owners ("broker nonvotes"), those shares will count toward satisfying the quorum requirement. If you own shares in street name, we encourage you to provide voting  instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. Once a share is counted as present at the Annual Meeting, it will count as present for quorum purposes throughout the Annual Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement of that meeting  unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjournment or postponement).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is entitled to vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Only holders of the 159,022,009 shares of our common stock outstanding as of the close of business on March 15, 2019,  can vote at or prior to the Annual Meeting. Each of these shareholders has one vote for each share of our stock held on that date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If the records of our transfer agent show that you own shares in your name or if you own shares through our Dividend  Reinvestment Plan at the close of business on March 15, 2019, then you may vote (1) via the internet at http://www.proxyvote.com, (2) in person at the Annual Meeting, (3) by mail after first requesting a printed copy of this  Proxy Statement, proxy card and Annual Report on Form 10-K and following the instructions set forth on the proxy card or (4) by telephone after reviewing the Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K at http://www.proxyvote.com. Instructions for using these convenient services are set forth on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you plan to vote in person at our meeting, you will need  to request a ballot to vote your shares. In addition, if you own your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from your bank, broker or other nominee to vote at the meeting.   
[END TABLE]
If you own shares in street name, you may vote via telephone or the internet if your bank, broker or other nominee makes those methods available, in which case your bank, broker or other nominee will provide instructions with your Proxy Statement. 
The telephone and internet voting procedures will authenticate your identity, allow you to give your voting instructions and confirm that we properly recorded your instructions. If you vote via the internet, you should understand that there might be costs associated with electronic access that you must bear, such as usage charges from internet access providers and telephone companies. You will need a touch tone telephone to vote by telephone.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the effect of not voting at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The consequences of not voting at the Annual Meeting will depend on how you own your shares. If the records of our  transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services LLC, show that you own shares in your name or if you own shares through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and you do not vote, we cannot consider those shares present at the meeting and they will not  count toward satisfying the quorum requirement.  
[END TABLE]
If you own shares in street name and do not vote, your broker, bank or other nominee may vote your shares at the meeting. If you do not give voting instructions for your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee may or may not be able to vote your shares in its discretion depending on the proposals before the meeting. Your broker, bank or other nominee may vote your shares in its discretion on routine matters such as Proposal 3, the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm, but may not vote your shares in its discretion on the other Proposals. If you own shares in street name, we encourage you to provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. You can change your vote at any time before the Annual Meeting by submitting a new proxy or by providing written  notice to our Secretary and voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Your presence at the Annual Meeting does not in and of itself revoke your proxy. You also are invited to attend the Annual Meeting in person. However, because a beneficial owner is  not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the  Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Unless you properly revoke your proxy, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. If you specify a choice by means of the proxy, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares as you specify. If you do not specify a choice, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We will handle all proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders carefully to  protect your voting privacy. No one will disclose your vote either within Harley-Davidson or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements; (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of  the vote; and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who will count the vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will count the vote. Its representative will serve as the inspector of the election.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who pays to prepare and solicit the proxies?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We pay the cost of soliciting the proxies relating to the Annual Meeting, except for some costs that may arise through  your use of the telephone and internet. We may request proxies in person, by telephone, and internet, as well as through the mail. We also expect to ask banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries to forward proxy materials  to their principals and to obtain proxies. We will reimburse these institutions for their out-of-pocket expenses.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I obtain printed copies of the proxy materials?
