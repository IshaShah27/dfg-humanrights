Your prompt response is helpful and your cooperation will be appreciated.  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  
You may obtain a free copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and available at its website at www.sec.gov. Please contact the Corporate Secretary, Woodward, Inc., 1081 Woodward Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80524 or email investor.relations@woodward.com. This report is also available at www.proxydocs.com/wwd.  ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Woodward, Inc. ("Woodward" or the "Company"), on behalf of its Board of Directors (the "Board"), is soliciting your proxy to vote at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on January 30, 2019 (or at any postponement or adjournment of the meeting) (the "Annual Meeting"). This proxy statement summarizes the information you need to know to vote at the meeting. 
We began mailing this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card on or about December 18, 2018, to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Woodward, Inc. Annual Report, which includes our most recent audited financial statements, is also being distributed with this proxy statement. 
Who Can Vote at the Meeting? 
Stockholders who owned Woodward common stock at the close of business on the record date, December 3, 2018, are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of the record date, there were 61,834,973 shares of Woodward common stock outstanding. 
How many votes do I get per share? 
Each share of Woodward common stock that you own entitles you to one vote on each matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting, except for the election of directors, for which you may cumulate your votes. Since four directors are standing for election, you will be entitled to four director votes for each share of stock you own. Of this total, you may choose how many votes you wish to cast for each director. The Board is not soliciting discretionary authority to cumulate votes with respect to the election of directors. 
How do I vote? 
Woodward offers stockholders the opportunity to vote by mail, by telephone, or via the Internet. Instructions to use these methods are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. We urge you to vote promptly, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person. 
If you vote by telephone or via the Internet, please have your proxy or voting instruction card available. A telephone or Internet vote authorizes the named proxies in the same manner as if you marked, signed, and returned the card by mail. Voting by telephone and via the Internet are valid proxy voting methods under the laws of Delaware (our state of incorporation) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (our "Bylaws"). 
If you properly fill in your proxy card and send it to us in time to vote, your shares will be voted as you have directed. If you sign the proxy card but do not make specific choices, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation as follows: 
"FOR" the election of each of the Board's nominees to the Board; 
"FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; 
"FOR" the advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company's named executive officers; and 
"FOR" the approval of the amendments to the Amended and Restated Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, including an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1,400,000. 
If any other matter is presented at the meeting, your shares will be voted in accordance with the proxyholder's best judgment. At the time this proxy statement was printed, we were not aware of any additional matters to be acted on at the meeting. 
How do I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
You may revoke your proxy by:

[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, please follow the instructions on the Voting Instruction Form you receive from your broker.  SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS SUBMITTED FOR VOTE 
The following are only summaries of the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting. You should review the full discussion of each proposal in this proxy statement before casting your vote. 
Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
Director Nominees: At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to elect to the Board the four nominees for director identified in this proxy statement. Each director will be elected to serve a three-year term and will hold office until the 2021 Annual Meeting held in or about January 2022 and until a successor is elected and qualified. 
Vote Required: Because this is an uncontested election, directors are elected by a majority vote. A nominee for director in an uncontested election will be elected if the votes cast "for" that nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" that nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered in the calculation. We have adopted a director resignation policy. Accordingly, each director has submitted an irrevocable resignation contingent upon not receiving a majority of votes in an uncontested election and acceptance of the resignation by the Board. 
Proposal 2: Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm: At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. 
Vote Required: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of Woodward common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will count as a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Proposal 3: Approval of Advisory Resolution Regarding the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers 
Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers: At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to approve an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
Vote Required: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of Woodward common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Annual Meeting will be required for the approval of the advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. Abstentions will count as a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
This proposal 3, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" proposal, is not binding on the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program. 
Proposal 4: Approval of Amendments to the Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan 
Amendments to the Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan: At the 2016 Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company approved the Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as further amended and restated at the 2017 Annual Meeting (the "Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan" or the "Omnibus Incentive Plan"). At the 2018 Annual Meeting, you will be asked to approve additional amendments to the Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan, including an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder by 1,400,000. 
Vote Required: The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on Proposal 4 at the Annual Meeting will be required for the approval of the amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. With respect to Proposal 4,  SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS SUBMITTED FOR VOTE (continued) 
 abstentions will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Quorum 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting of holders of shares representing a majority of the votes of the common stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a stockholder does not provide voting instructions to his or her broker or nominee and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter, as further described below under "Voting of Shares Held in Street Name by Your Broker." 
Abstentions 
Abstentions are counted as present for establishing a quorum. For all proposals in this proxy statement, except for the election of directors, abstentions have the same effect as votes against the matter. 
Voting of Shares Held in Street Name by Your Broker 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker how to vote your shares. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. In order to vote your shares in person, you must provide us with a legal proxy from your broker. 
Brokerage firms have authority to vote customers' shares for which they have not received voting instructions on certain "routine" matters, such as ratification of the auditors. If you do not provide voting instructions, your brokerage firm may either vote your shares on routine matters or leave your shares unvoted. On the other hand, absent instructions from customers, a brokerage firm cannot vote customers' shares on non-routine matters, such as the election of directors, the advisory resolution regarding the compensation of our named executive officers, and the approval of the amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The shares for which instructions are not given and therefore, remain unvoted, are referred to as "broker non-votes." For the purposes of this Annual Meeting, the only routine matter is the Ratification of the Appointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Consequently, if you do not give your brokerage firm specific instructions, your shares will not be voted on the other, non-routine, matters and will not be counted in determining the number of shares necessary for approval, although they will count for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. We encourage you to provide instructions to your brokerage firm. This ensures your shares will be voted at the meeting. 
In order for your shares to be voted on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting, including the election of directors, we urge all stockholders whose shares are held in street name by a brokerage firm to provide voting instructions to the brokerage firm.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Woodward's certificate of incorporation provides for the Board to be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, with directors in each class serving a three-year term. Woodward's certificate of incorporation further provides that the Board must consist of no less than six directors. The exact number of directors serving on the Board, and the exact number of directors in each class, is determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. If the number of directors changes, any increase or decrease must be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible. The Company's Bylaws and Director Guidelines provide that directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast and we have a corresponding resignation policy for uncontested director elections. Contested elections are determined by a plurality vote. 
The Board's three classes are currently comprised of three Class I directors, four Class II directors, and three Class III directors. Each of the four directors identified in this proxy statement as standing for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders has been nominated by the Board at the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee to hold office for a three-year term expiring in January 2022, or when a successor is elected and qualified. Ms. Drake is standing for election by stockholders for the first time. Messrs. Cohn, Rulseh and Sengstack are incumbents. Directors identified in this proxy statement who are not standing for election at this meeting will continue in office for the remainder of their respective terms. 
If a nominee is unavailable for election, proxy holders will vote for another nominee proposed by the Nominating and Governance Committee. 
We identify below certain biographical information of each of our directors and the director nominees for election, including his or her principal occupation, public company directorships currently held or held during the past five years and other business affiliations. We also describe the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each director and director nominee that led the Board to conclude that he or she should serve as a member of the Board.

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS 
The Board, during its annual review of the independence of its members, has determined that each member of the Board, other than Mr. Gendron, is independent under the criteria established by current NASDAQ listing requirements for independent directors. In addition, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee and each member of the Compensation Committee meets the additional independence criteria required for audit committee and compensation committee members, as applicable, established by SEC rules and regulations and NASDAQ listing requirements.  BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Mr. Gendron serves as our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Because one individual serves as both Chairman and CEO, the Board appoints an independent director to serve as "Lead Director." Our Lead Director is Mr. Cohn, who was appointed to that position by the Board in 2017. The Board recently adopted a Lead Director charter that provides a clear and formal delineation of the duties and responsibilities of the Lead Director. The independent Lead Director, among other duties, chairs separate executive sessions of the independent directors following regularly scheduled Board meetings. The duties and responsibilities of the Lead Director are more fully set forth under the "Board Meetings and Committees – Lead Director" section below. The Board believes the combined Chairman/CEO position, together with an independent Lead Director, has certain advantages over other board leadership structures and best meets the Company's current needs. Mr. Gendron's leadership as Chairman and CEO provides our Board with detailed and in-depth knowledge of the Company's strategy, markets, operations and financial condition, and enhances our ability to communicate a clear and consistent strategy to our stockholders, employees and business partners. This leadership structure differentiates the oversight role of the Lead Director and other independent directors from the oversight role of the Chairman/CEO and other management, enabling the Board and the Chairman/CEO to have greater clarity and focus on their respective leadership roles. 
The Board is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the management of the business and affairs of the Company; selecting and recommending to stockholders appropriate candidates for election to the Board; reviewing and, where appropriate, approving the business plans, major strategies and financial objectives of the Company; evaluating Board processes and performance and the overall effectiveness of the Board; evaluating the performance of the Company and of senior management; requiring, approving and overseeing the implementation of the Company's succession plans; reviewing compliance with applicable laws and regulations and adopting and overseeing policies of corporate conduct to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a corporate culture that reflects the Company's values, and maintenance of necessary accounting, financial and other controls. 
The Board understands there is no single "one-size fits all" approach to providing Board leadership in the competitive and changing environment in which we operate. The optimal Board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. At present, the Board believes its current structure effectively maintains independent oversight and management. Consistent with our Director Guidelines, the Board reviews and considers whether the positions of Chairman and CEO should be combined or separated as part of a regular review of the effectiveness of the Company's governance structure. 
BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES 
The Board met nine times in fiscal year 2018. All directors attended at least 80 percent of the aggregate of the total meetings of the Board and all committees on which they served. Directors are encouraged, but are not required, to attend annual meetings of stockholders. The Company's last annual meeting of stockholders was attended by all directors. 
The Board has the following standing committees: Audit Committee; Compensation Committee; Nominating and Governance Committee; and Executive Committee. All actions by committees are reported to the Board at the next regularly scheduled meeting. As part of its ongoing corporate governance review, the Board reviews its assignment of committee memberships annually and made no changes in fiscal year 2018 to those assignments as reported in last year's proxy statement.  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
The following table reflects the committee memberships as of the filing date of this proxy statement:

Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee oversees and monitors the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes, including the quality of internal controls over those processes and audits of the Company's financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also assists the Board with overseeing the Company's processes for risk mitigation and with monitoring compliance with laws, regulations and the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Company's financial reporting risk exposure and the Company's risk assessment and risk management processes. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees compliance of the Company's financial statements with applicable rules and regulations and recommends to the Board, based on reviews and discussion with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, that the audited financial statements of the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Audit Committee also retains, oversees, and evaluates the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and is involved in the selection of the lead audit partner. The Audit Committee also reviews and approves the selection and tenure of the Company's internal audit lead, and periodically assesses the quality of internal audit activity. The Audit Committee operates under a charter that more fully describes the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews its charter at least annually and recommends to the Board such revisions as it deems necessary or appropriate. The Audit Committee charter is available at http://www.woodward.com/Charter-Audit-Committee. 
Consistent with SEC rules and regulations and NASDAQ's listing standards, and in accordance with the Audit Committee charter, all members of the Audit Committee are independent directors, and meet all enhanced independence requirements for Audit Committee members. The Board of Directors determined that Messrs. Sengstack and Thayer are audit committee financial experts, within the meaning of Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have experience resulting in "financial sophistication" as defined under NASDAQ listing requirements. 
The Audit Committee meets as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities. 
The Audit Committee held six meetings in fiscal year 2018.  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee discharges the responsibilities of the Board relating to compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, conducts an annual performance review of the Chief Executive Officer with input from the independent members of the Board, produces the annual report required by SEC rules, and recommends to the Board the inclusion of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its proxy statement. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation of all of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee has oversight responsibility for the Company's annual and long-term incentive plans, which includes Woodward's Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Cash LTI"), and the Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be amended from time to time). Except as described under the "Delegation of Authority" section, the Compensation Committee determines and takes all action, including granting of all incentives and/or stock options to eligible recipients, in accordance with the terms of the plans, and serves as administrator of the plans and oversees compliance with the terms of the plans. The Compensation Committee reviews performance against targets for both the annual incentive compensation plan and the long-term incentive compensation plan. The Compensation Committee's written charter, which describes the specific duties of the Compensation Committee, is available at http://www.woodward.com/Charter-Compensation-Committee. 
Consistent with NASDAQ's listing requirements, and in accordance with the Compensation Committee charter, all members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors and meet the heightened standards for independence of Compensation Committee members under the NASDAQ listing rules. The Compensation Committee charter provides that the Compensation Committee may, after reviewing certain specified independence criteria, retain or obtain the advice of compensation advisers. The Compensation Committee charter also provides that the Compensation Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such compensation advisers, and that the Company will provide for appropriate funding for payment of reasonable compensation to any compensation advisers retained by the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee meets as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee held four meetings in fiscal year 2018. 
In making its decisions and completing its annual review of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee routinely examines a variety of factors which typically include the following (among others): 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Delegation of Authority 
The Compensation Committee charter provides authority to the Compensation Committee to delegate its role and responsibilities to subcommittees entirely made up of Compensation Committee members. The Compensation Committee delegated to the Chairman of the Compensation Committee the authority to approve any and all option exercises when the optionee seeks to pay for the cost of the option and/or the taxes associated with the transaction with stock previously owned and held by the optionee for at least six months. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee is authorized to further delegate these responsibilities to any other member of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also delegated, to a subcommittee comprised of the Compensation Committee Chairperson and one other Compensation Committee member, the authority to review and approve the grant of options, restricted stock units and/or restricted stock to officers and other employees of the Company, members of the Board, or consultants of the Company in the interval between regularly scheduled meetings of the Compensation Committee, subject to the pool for awards as identified and approved by the Compensation Committee in advance on an annual basis (such grants, "interim grants"). Additionally, the Board has (i) delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority make certain interim grants and (ii) delegated to the Compensation Committee all of the Board's rights to impose restrictions on such authority of the Chief Executive Officer. In accordance with such delegation by the Board, the Compensation Committee has prohibited the Chief Executive Officer from making interim grants to any member of the Board, any Section 16 officer, or any other elected officer of the Company, and has placed limits on the size of any interim grant the CEO may award to any single individual. 
Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the Company's compensation policies and practices, and believes they are robust and effective. The Company also conducted a review of its compensation plans and related risk to the Company. The Company and the Compensation Committee, with the input of Aon, the Company's compensation consultant, have concluded that any risks arising from its employee compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends qualified individuals to fill any vacancies on the Board, develops and administers the Director Guidelines and the Company's guidelines for corporate governance, establishes other guidelines, such as stock ownership guidelines for officers and directors, reviews and reassesses the Company's programs and policies related to its codes of conduct, oversees an annual Board self-evaluation, and addresses other governance related matters. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee periodically evaluates the compensation and benefits of the Company's non-employee members of the Board and recommends any changes to the Board for approval. 
In accordance with NASDAQ listing requirements and the Nominating and Governance Committee's charter, all members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee meets as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities. The Nominating and Governance Committee held five meetings in fiscal year 2018. The Nominating and Governance Committee charter is available at http://www.woodward.com/Charter-Nominating-and-Governance-Committee. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee exercises all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business when the Board is not in session, and when, in the opinion of the Chairman of the Board, a particular  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
 matter should not be postponed until the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Executive Committee may declare cash dividends. The Executive Committee may not authorize certain major corporate actions such as amending the certificate of incorporation, amending the bylaws, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, or recommending the sale, lease, or exchange of substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Executive Committee meets as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities. The Executive Committee held no meetings in fiscal year 2018. The Executive Committee charter is available at http://www.woodward.com/Charter-Executive-Committee. 
Director Nomination Process 
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers candidates for Board membership as recommended by directors, management, or stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee uses the same criteria to evaluate all candidates for Board membership, whether recommended by directors, management, or stockholders. As it deems necessary, the Nominating and Governance Committee may engage consultants or third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends qualified director candidates for nomination by the Board based on the skills and characteristics that the Board seeks in its members as well as consideration of the diversity of the Board as a whole. This review includes an assessment of, among other things, a candidate's knowledge, education, experience, cultural background, including race, gender and age, and skills in areas critical to understanding the Company and its business, with a commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks candidates with the highest professional and personal ethics and values, that are aligned with the philosophy and concepts as expressed in the Company's Constitution, and who will operate in accordance with the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Nominating and Governance Committee also assesses a candidate's ability to make independent analytical inquiries, and willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties. 
Director nominees should possess the following experience, qualifications, attributes and skills: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An understanding of the principal operational and financial objectives, plans and strategies of the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An understanding of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An understanding of the relative standing of the Company in relation to its competitors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leadership experience at the policy-making level in business, government, education or public interest.   
[END TABLE]
Prospective directors should be committed to representing the long-term interests of the stockholders. A potential director must exhibit an inquisitive and objective perspective, an ability to think strategically, an ability to identify practical problems, and an ability to assess alternative courses of action that contribute to the long-term success of the business. Director candidates must have industry expertise and/or commit to understanding the Company's industry as a basis to address strategic and operational issues of importance to the Company. Directors are also expected to commit substantial time and energy to the Board and should ensure that other existing and future time commitments do not materially interfere with their service as a director. Directors shall limit their service to a maximum of four other public companies, and in the case of employee directors, to one other public company. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers other relevant factors, as it deems appropriate, including the current composition of the Board and the need for expertise on various Board committees. Every effort is made to complement and supplement skills within the Board and strengthen identified areas of need. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers the ability of candidates to meet independence and other requirements of the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory bodies exercising authority over the Company. Under the Director Guidelines, no individual will be nominated by the Board for re-election if such individual will  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
 achieve the age of 70 as of the annual stockholder meeting date of such re-election, unless the Board determines in its sole discretion that extraordinary circumstances exist that would support any such nomination. Additionally, directors whose professional responsibilities change significantly from those they had when they were elected to the Board or who are involved in other circumstances that may negatively impact the Board or the Company should volunteer to resign from the Board. Such persons should not necessarily leave the Board. There should, however, be an opportunity for the Board through the Nominating and Governance Committee to review the continued appropriateness of Board membership under the circumstances. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee's process for evaluating potential director candidates normally requires one or more members of the Nominating and Governance Committee, and others as appropriate, to interview prospective nominees in person or by telephone. Upon identification of a qualified candidate, the Nominating and Governance Committee will recommend a candidate for consideration by the full Board. 
Stockholders wishing to suggest a candidate for Board membership should write our Corporate Secretary at 1081 Woodward Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80524, and provide certain information to the Company as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The stockholder's name and contact information;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A statement that the writer is a stockholder of record and is proposing a candidate for consideration by the Nominating and  Governance Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name of, and contact information for, the candidate and a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and  serve as a director, if nominated and elected;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A statement of the candidate's business and educational experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Information regarding the factors described above sufficient to enable the Nominating and Governance Committee to evaluate  the candidate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A statement of the value that the candidate would add to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A statement detailing any relationship between the candidate and any of our customers, suppliers, or competitors; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Detailed information about any relationship or understanding between the proposing stockholder and the candidate.   
[END TABLE]
In connection with its evaluation, the Nominating and Governance Committee may request additional information from the candidate or the recommending stockholder. The Nominating and Governance Committee has discretion to decide which individuals to recommend for nomination as directors. In order to give the Nominating and Governance Committee sufficient time to evaluate a recommended candidate, the recommendation must be received by our Corporate Secretary not later than the 120th calendar day before the one year anniversary of the date our proxy statement was mailed to stockholders in connection with the previous year's Annual Meeting of stockholders. No candidates for director nominations were submitted to the Nominating and Governance Committee by any stockholder in connection with the election of directors at this Annual Meeting. 
Board Composition and Diversity 
The Board meets periodically with the Nominating and Governance Committee to review Board composition for diversity of knowledge, experience, cultural background, race, gender, and age which, when taken together, enables the Board to ensure that board members possess the skills, perspectives and expertise necessary to effectively oversee the Company's business. In this regard, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, for each incumbent director and potential nominee, the various factors described in the below table. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the assessment and its recommendations with the Board.  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is committed to exercising best practices of corporate governance and recognizes the importance of a Board that contains diverse experience at policy-making levels in business, public service, education, and technology, as well as other relevant knowledge that contributes to the Company's global activities. The Board believes that diversity is an important component of Board membership, and is guided by the Company's Bylaws, Director Guidelines, and Constitution, which requires the Board to adhere to the philosophy and concepts, including respect for the dignity, value and equality of all members. 
Board diversity, leadership and experience qualifications for our independent directors are summarized in the table below:

[END TABLE]
* Including year appointed 
Lead Director 
In November 2017, Mr. Cohn was appointed to Lead Director. In July 2018, the Board adopted a Lead Director charter to establish a clear and formal delineation of Lead Director duties and responsibilities. The Lead Director chairs separate meetings of the independent directors, generally following each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Lead Director facilitates discussion and open dialogue among the independent directors. Topics discussed are at the discretion of the independent directors, and generally include among other things, a review of our Chief Executive Officer's performance. The Lead Director then meets with the Chief Executive Officer to review items discussed at the meeting and to provide feedback from the Board with regard to his overall performance as CEO. The Lead Director then reports to the independent directors regarding each such feedback meeting with the Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the Lead Director (together with the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee) presents to the Chief Executive Officer his annual performance review as conducted by the Compensation Committee with input from the independent members of the Board of Directors, and the Lead Director (together with the Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee) reviews and reports on the results of the Board's annual self-evaluation, discussed below. The Lead Director also  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
 communicates with the Chief Executive Officer on a regular basis to discuss any other Board matters or concerns, and acts as a liaison in that regard between the independent members of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, without inhibiting direct communication between them. The charter provides that the Lead Director will serve a maximum term of five years in such capacity. 
Board and Board Committees Self-Evaluation Process 
Board and committee evaluations play a critical role in ensuring the effective functioning of our Board and Board committees. Our Board annually evaluates the performance of the Board and its committees. As part of the Board's self-assessment process, directors are provided with detailed questionnaires and participate in a guided, interview-based self-evaluation designed to offer a thoughtful and substantive reflection on the Board's performance. The questionnaires and interviews consider various topics related to Board composition, structure, effectiveness and responsibilities, as well as the overall mix of director skills, experience and backgrounds. As set forth in its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees the Board and committee evaluation process. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the questionnaires and the self-evaluation process, considers whether changes are recommended, and reports the results to the Board. 
Stockholder Communications With the Board of Directors 
Stockholders may send communications to the Board by submitting a letter addressed to: Woodward, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 1081 Woodward Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80524. The Board has instructed the Corporate Secretary to forward such communications to the Lead Director. The Board has also instructed the Corporate Secretary to review such correspondence and, at the Corporate Secretary's discretion, not to forward correspondence which is deemed of a commercial or frivolous nature or inappropriate for Board consideration. The Corporate Secretary may also forward the stockholder communication within the Company to the Chief Executive Officer and President or to another executive officer to facilitate an appropriate response. 
The Corporate Secretary maintains a log of all communications from stockholders and the disposition of such communications, which the directors review at least annually. 
Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for overseeing management's identification and mitigation of Company risks, including but not limited to risks associated with our strategic plan, capital structure, development activities, compliance with government regulations, and other significant inherent risks such as cybersecurity. The Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for risk management processes, and various committees of the Board composed entirely of independent directors also have responsibility for some aspects of risk management oversight. While the Board and its various committees have oversight responsibilities for risk management processes, management has responsibility for the day-to-day aspects of risk management. The Board and its committees receive regular reports on risk management from Company management and independent auditors. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for risks relating to the Company's financial statements, financial reporting processes, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and the Company's compliance with its financial and ethics policies. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for monitoring risks associated with the design and administration of the Company's compensation programs and equity compensation plans, and performs the annual performance review of the CEO and ensures the independence of the compensation consultants. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees risks relating to the Company's corporate governance processes, compliance with the SEC and NASDAQ rules and regulations, and other state and federal laws and regulations relating to corporate governance, and reviews and reassesses the adequacy of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
The Board and its committees have direct and independent access to management. We believe this division of risk management responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks that Woodward faces. The existing Board leadership structure encourages communication between the independent directors and management, including those as a result of discussions between the Lead Director and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. By fostering increased communication, we believe that the current Board leadership structure leads to the identification and implementation of effective risk management strategies. 
Related Person Transaction Policies and Procedures 
The Board adopted the Company's Related Person Transaction Policies and Procedures (our "RPT Policy"), which provides that the Audit Committee will review and approve Interested Transactions (as described below). Our RPT Policy delegates the authority to act with respect to Interested Transactions that are valued below a stated threshold to the Chair of the Audit Committee. 
Our RPT Policy defines an "Interested Transaction" with reference to transactions described in Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, which generally means a transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships or any material amendments or modifications thereto in which the Company (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is, or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any Related Person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect interest. 
"Related Person" also is defined in our RPT Policy with respect to the definitions contained in Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Generally, "Related Persons" consist of any director or executive officer of the Company, any nominee for director, any holder of five percent or more of the Company's common stock, or any immediate family member of any such persons. "Immediate family member" means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law,daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of any such person, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such person. It may also include entities with which any of such persons have a relationship. 
The approval procedures in our RPT Policy state that the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the Interested Transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances. In addition, our RPT Policy states that, in connection with the approval or ratification of an Interested Transaction involving an outside director or nominee for director, the Audit Committee should consider whether such transaction would compromise such director's status as: (1) an independent director under NASDAQ's independence standards, (2) an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or a "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, if such non-employee director serves on the Compensation Committee of the Board, or (3) an independent director under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, if such non-employee director serves on the Audit Committee of the Board. Our RPT Policy also identifies certain transactions that are deemed to be pre-approved, including transactions involving competitive bids, regulated transactions, and employee transactions. No director participates in any discussion for approval of a related party transaction for which he or she is an interested party other than is necessary to provide relevant information to the Audit Committee. Our RPT Policy is available at http://www.woodward.com/Related-Person-Transaction-Policy. 
Woodward is not currently engaged in any Interested Transactions. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Ms. Petrovich and Messrs. Rulseh, Cohn, and Donovan served as members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee members have no interlocking relationships required to be disclosed under SEC rules and regulations.  BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES (continued) 
Director Compensation 
We do not pay directors who are also Woodward employees additional compensation for their services as directors. Non-employee directors are paid cash compensation for their service on the Board, as well as additional cash compensation for any memberships and/or chair positions on various Board committees or as Lead Director. Additionally, non-employee directors are awarded equity compensation (in the form of stock options) based on an targeted delivered value as recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee and approved by the Board, following consultation with and recommendations from Aon. For this purpose, "delivered value" means the total Black-Scholes value on the day prior to the effective date of the grant. The exercise price of the stock option awards is determined on the effective grant date and is not less than (and is typically equal to) the closing price of the Company's stock as quoted on NASDAQ on that day. For fiscal year 2018, based on Board approval of targeted delivered value, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of stock options to non-employee directors on September 29, 2017 at an exercise price of $78.97, which was the closing price of Woodward common stock as quoted on NASDAQ on the effective grant date (October 2, 2017). 
As set forth in our Omnibus Incentive Plan, however, no non-employee director may receive equity awards in any fiscal year (the value of which will be based on their grant date fair value determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) that, in the aggregate, exceed $300,000, provided that such amount is increased to $450,000 in the fiscal year of a non-employee director's initial appointment. The number of stock options awarded to each director is based on the intended delivered value, divided by the Black-Scholes value of a stock option as calculated by Aon for all stock option participants in a given year. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates the market competitiveness of the Company's Board of Director compensation program every two years. Accordingly, as established in its calendar, the Nominating and Governance Committee commissioned Aon to conduct a competitive assessment in September 2017 of the Company's Board of Director compensation program relative to market practice. Aon analyzed Board of Director compensation practices for the Company's peer group, as defined in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis discussed below, and compared Woodward's Board compensation program at the time to market practice. Based on the results of the competitive assessment, the Nominating and Governance Committee determined it was appropriate to increase Board cash compensation effective October 1, 2017, for fiscal year 2018, to more closely align to market levels. 
Cash compensation for non-employee directors was as follows in fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Retainer (1)     $75,000     
 Lead Director     $12,500

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") provides an overview of our compensation philosophy, strategy, objectives and structure for fiscal year 2018. This section is intended to be read in conjunction with the tables that immediately follow, which provide further historical compensation information for the NEOs. 
For fiscal year 2018, our NEOs were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Thomas A. Gendron    Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President 
 Robert F. Weber, Jr.    Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer 
 A. Christopher Fawzy    Corporate Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer 
 Sagar A. Patel    President, Aircraft Turbine Systems 
 Chad R. Preiss    President, Industrial Control Systems 
[END TABLE]
Executive Summary 
Our executive compensation program has been designed to (1) provide a competitive total compensation program that enables us to attract, retain, and motivate a high-performance executive management team, and (2) link the total compensation program payouts to Company and stockholder interests. We believe that proper administration of this program should result in a compensation program that is aligned with, and motivates improvement in, our fundamental financial performance and supports the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Our executive compensation program is based on the overall financial performance of the Company and is structured as a total compensation package comprised of the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual short-term incentive compensation under the Woodward Variable Incentive Plan ("WVIP"); and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation under the Company's long-term incentive program ("LTI Plan"), which  includes a cash component (under the Cash LTI, as discussed below) and equity components (non-qualified stock options).  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the executive compensation program for NEOs includes health and welfare benefits, a deferred compensation program, defined contribution plans, change in control agreements, and other ancillary benefits. 
On November 7, 2018, we reported our financial results for fiscal year 2018, which included the following highlights: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net sales for fiscal year 2018 of $2.326 billion, an increase of 11% compared to $2.098 billion in fiscal year  2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net earnings for fiscal year 2018 of $180.4 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, compared to $200.5 million, or  $3.16 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2017.  
[END TABLE]
The net earnings results are reflected in the compensation paid in fiscal year 2018, particularly through the WVIP. 
Executive Compensation Mix 
For our NEOs, we believe it is important to provide a significant portion of total compensation tied to incentives that can fluctuate, up or down, based on our financial and operational performance to align with stockholder  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 interests. With respect to variable compensation, the Compensation Committee places a balanced emphasis on both short term (i.e., the WVIP) and long-term Company performance (i.e., Cash LTI and equity compensation); however, the majority of target variable compensation for our NEOs is attributable to long-term objectives. 
In analyzing the pay mix and various elements of compensation for each NEO, the Compensation Committee annually considers competitive market data; internal equity (the relative compensation among the Company's NEOs); and the other individual factors described below in Compensation Philosophy and Strategy, including the nature and scope of the individual's role at Woodward, the individual's performance, knowledge, skills, abilities, potential, and overall contribution to the Company and impact to shareholder value. 
The charts below reflect the target mix pay between fixed and variable compensation components based on FY18 target compensation for our NEOs during fiscal year 2018, which reflects our pay-for-performance philosophy: 
Compensation Philosophy and Strategy 
Our compensation philosophy and strategy is to establish total compensation (base salary, annual short-term cash incentives, and long-term incentives) for each NEO that is competitive with total compensation for executives in comparable positions at companies in our peer comparator group. Our compensation approach reflects multiple factors such as (i) the individual's performance, knowledge, skills, abilities, potential, (ii) significant contributions to the Company and impact to shareholder value, and (iii) our ability to achieve our goals to attract and retain industry leading talent. 
Our philosophy places a strong focus on pay-for-performance, with an emphasis on variable compensation, and in particular, long-term incentive compensation that directly ties to Company performance. Our variable compensation plans (annual short-term incentives and long-term incentives), which for fiscal year 2018 represented between 66% and 84% of our NEOs' target total compensation opportunities, are designed so that the payout opportunity is directly linked to the achievement of pre-determined financial performance metrics, with upside opportunity for exceeding the pre-determined goals. Our variable compensation plans also include equity-based compensation to align NEO and stockholder interests. With the variable incentive components of our executive compensation program, we strive to align the interests of the NEOs with the interests of our stockholders in different ways by focusing on both short-term and long-term performance goals, by promoting ownership of the Company, and by linking reward outcomes to our financial performance. As a result of Woodward's total compensation approach, which includes base pay and variable pay (annual incentive  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 compensation and long-term incentive compensation), the actual performance of the Company significantly influences the total compensation received by our NEOs. 
Consideration of Stockholder Say on Pay Vote 
In January 2018, our stockholders voted on an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of our named executive officers, which was approved by 97.2% of the votes cast on the proposal (the "say on pay proposal"). The Compensation Committee determined the 97.2% favorable vote demonstrated strong stockholder support for Woodward's overall executive compensation approach and the related actions described in its 2017 proxy statement, and further determined that current practices and processes did not require any significant modifications to achieve the desired results or to address any stockholder concerns. In addition, at the 2016 Annual Meeting held in January 2017, our stockholders indicated their preference for an annual say on pay vote in an advisory resolution regarding the frequency of say on pay proposals, which the Board adopted. Accordingly, a say on pay proposal is again being submitted to our stockholders for consideration at the 2018 Annual Meeting, which is included as Proposal 3 in this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of these advisory votes when evaluating future executive compensation arrangements. 
The Compensation Committee's Interaction with Management 
In order to design compensation programs that are aligned with appropriate Company performance goals and strategic direction, the Compensation Committee works closely with management, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Corporate Vice President, Human Resources, and the Corporate Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary. Specifically, management facilitates the alignment process by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing compensation data of our NEOs, which is provided by our executive compensation consultant for comparative  benchmarking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluating NEO performance (with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Making recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding annual short-term incentive plan design and performance  metrics; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Making recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation of the NEOs (with the exception of the  Chief Executive Officer) for base salary, annual short-term incentive compensation targets, long-term cash incentive compensation targets, and long-term equity compensation. The Chief Executive Officer's compensation, including base salary, is  determined by the Compensation Committee, with guidance from our compensation consultant, relative to comparative market data, as well as by measuring his performance against a defined process led by the Compensation Committee Chairman involving all  independent Board members.  
[END TABLE]
All decisions regarding executive compensation are ultimately made by the Compensation Committee. 
The Company's Corporate Vice President, Human Resources, works with the Compensation Committee Chair to establish the agenda for Compensation Committee meetings. At the Compensation Committee's request, the Chief Executive Officer regularly attends the meetings and provides background information regarding the Company's strategic objectives, evaluation of the performance of the executive officers, and compensation recommendations as to executive officers other than himself. The Compensation Committee may also seek input from the Corporate Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, as necessary and appropriate, to carry out its duties. The Corporate Vice President, Human Resources, provides input on executive compensation structure, performance assessment process and data, potential promotions, talent management and succession planning, and compensation associated with promotions. No employee is present during the discussion of his or her compensation.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Interaction with Compensation Consultants 
In making its determinations with respect to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee generally engages the services of an independent compensation consultant. In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee retained the services of Aon to assist with its review of the total compensation packages of the NEOs. 
The Compensation Committee retains Aon primarily to provide guidance for the executive compensation decision-making process. Annually, Aon provides the Compensation Committee with an analysis comparing the compensation for the NEOs to our compensation philosophy and to the data of our peer comparator group for base salary, target short-term incentives, target total cash, target long-term incentives (cash and equity), and target total compensation. In carrying out its assignment, the consultant may interact with members of management, including but not limited to the Chief Executive Officer, the Corporate Vice President, Human Resources, the Corporate Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, and the Vice President & Corporate Controller. 
In addition to their services with respect to compensation for the NEOs, Aon acts as a global compensation and benefits consultant for the Company and provides total compensation data for the Company's key leadership group. Management also utilizes Aon's benefits index and compensation and benefits survey data to benchmark compensation and benefits for the Company's non-NEOs. 
During fiscal year 2018, in accordance with SEC rules and regulations and NASDAQ listing requirements, the Compensation Committee considered various factors relating to compensation consultant independence, including the following six factors established by the SEC: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The provision of other services to the Company by Aon;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of fees received from the Company by Aon as a percentage of total revenue;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aon's policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any business or personal relationship of the individual consultants with a member of the Compensation Committee;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any stock of the Company owned by the individual consultants; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any business or personal relationship of the individual consultants or Aon with an executive officer of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
As a result of the interactions with the Compensation Committee and management, the Company believes Aon has a well-developed understanding of our business, and is well positioned to provide objective guidance on compensation and benefit plans that are aligned with and reinforce our strategies and goals, and has determined that Aon is independent and free from any conflict of interest. 
Compensation Consultant Fees 
For fiscal year 2018, the Company paid Aon $829,628 for advice and services provided to the Compensation Committee and the Company. Of this amount, $445,551 was paid as a result of the work Aon performed for the Compensation Committee related to executive compensation advice and services, and $384,077 was paid as a result of the work Aon performed for the Company that was not related to executive compensation, including broad compensation benchmarking data applicable to non-executive employees, including international benchmarking data and services, and other health, welfare and retirement plan consulting services. 
The decision to use Aon for advice and services not related to executive compensation was made by management. While neither the Compensation Committee, nor the Board pre-approves these non-executive compensation services, the Compensation Committee annually reviews Aon's internal guidelines and practices  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 designed to guard against conflicts and ensure the objectivity of advice in connection with the Compensation Committee's review of the six compensation consultant conflicts of interest factors described above under "Interaction with Compensation Consultants." 
The Compensation Committee believes that the advice and services unrelated to executive compensation that Aon provided to the Company did not impact advice and services that Aon provided to the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters nor the independence of Aon with respect to management. 
Competitive Comparisons 
Our executive compensation program is benchmarked to be competitive with our peer comparator group. On an annual basis, companies in our peer comparator group are approved by the Compensation Committee. The companies included in our peer comparator group are selected from the Aon Total Compensation Measurement database on the basis of competition for business or talent, global and publicly-traded holding structure, level of operational complexity, similar revenue size, market capitalization, markets and industries served, and manufacturing profile. 
Based on its annual review, effective for fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to make changes to the companies comprising the peer group for pay and performance comparisons. Accordingly, CLARCOR, Inc., Roper Technologies, Inc., Valmont Industries, Inc., and Kaman Corporation were removed from the peer group. CLARCOR was removed due to its acquisition by Parker Hannifin. Roper Technologies, Valmont Industries, and Kaman Corporation were removed based on a difference in business operations and strategy, markets served, and/or customers relative to Woodward. Nordson Corporation and Hexcel Corporation were added to the peer group as a result of being similar in size (as measured by revenues, market capitalization and profitability), scope of operations, markets served, and customers. Based on the changes made effective for fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the composition of the revised peer group, as well as the number of companies comprising the revised peer group, was appropriate to benchmark competitive compensation levels and performance. 
Compensation data from our peer comparator group identified in the table below was reviewed as part of the Compensation Committee's process of determining target total compensation opportunities for each NEO for fiscal year 2018. We also reference this data across each component of compensation for our NEOs, including base salary, annual short-term incentive compensation, and long-term incentive compensation. At the time the peer group below was approved by the Compensation Committee, the peer group was comprised of companies that had revenues equal to 0.6x to 2.6x the Company's revenues which, based on Aon's recommendation, the Compensation Committee determined to be an appropriate range. Revenues served as a key evaluation criteria because we believe that it is a reasonable reflection of the scope and complexity of an organization, as well as the duties and responsibilities of the NEO positions being compared.

In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to use the same approach to competitive data to assess the NEOs' compensation levels as that which was used in fiscal year 2017. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee used raw competitive data (as compared to size adjusted data) to establish the  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 competitive market for pay levels due to the increased transparency of raw data for the Compensation Committee and executives, and because it lessens potential volatility in pay levels that can be attributable to small changes in executives' revenue responsibilities. 
Compensation Decisions Compared to Market Data 
When determining total compensation opportunities for our executives, we consider many factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our compensation philosophy, which provides guiding principles and broad direction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• external market data to provide a frame of reference for how comparable companies in our size range set compensation  opportunities as well as compensation trends;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature and scope of the individual's role at Woodward compared to the benchmark job;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the individual's performance, knowledge, skills, abilities, potential, and significant contributions to the Company  and impact to shareholder value; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the cumulative impact of our retention efforts over the course of the individual's career.  
[END TABLE]
In making compensation decisions and determinations, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Aon and management, matches the NEOs with similarly positioned executives at companies in the peer comparator group, which we refer to as the benchmark position. These matches facilitate pay comparisons based on functional matches, job duties, responsibilities, level of impact, and organizational level. 
When analyzing market data from our peer group, Aon presents data to the Compensation Committee at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for reference points. However, we do not target any percentile or percentile range as a specific objective for the compensation we pay. Rather, our compensation decisions are based on the full consideration of all of the above mentioned elements that provide input into our deliberations and inform our decisions. As a result of evaluating compensation based on the criteria described above, total target compensation for our NEOs may in certain circumstances be above or below the reference points provided by Aon. 
ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION 
Base Salary 
Base salary is an important compensation component we must pay to remain competitive in our industry and the marketplace in general. The Compensation Committee generally sets base salary and annual adjustments at levels considered appropriate for comparable NEO positions at companies in our peer comparator group. Base salaries are reviewed by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year preceding the effective date of the change. Specifically, base salaries are reviewed and approved in September of each year and are effective January 1st of the following year, which is a consistent practice for all employees of the Company as part of our Leading Performance Management Process. 
Base salaries for the NEOs are assessed and set using a blend of quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative data in our peer comparator group is considered in determining our NEOs' base salaries, and is presented to the Compensation Committee by Aon. We also consider qualitative performance data and factors to determine an NEO's base salary, including an individual NEO's performance, experience, responsibilities, management, leadership skills, and salary increase progression. For additional information, see the market data comparisons under the caption "Compensation Decisions Compared to Market Data." Base salary is found in the Summary Compensation Table in the Salary column. 
Annual Short-Term Incentive Compensation 
Annual short-term incentive compensation is a key component of the total compensation package. The Omnibus Incentive Plan, which sets forth the material terms of any awards intended to qualify as performance- COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 based compensation, permits the grant of annual cash-based incentive awards to eligible participants. These awards are provided pursuant to the WVIP under the authority provided in the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Management and non-management members participate in the WVIP to enhance organizational alignment, line of sight, and engagement toward the achievement of Company goals and objectives. The WVIP measures our internal annual financial and operational performance against pre-determined metrics. The WVIP is designed to provide short-term incentive compensation that is competitive with compensation offerings in our peer comparator group and to align compensation with financial performance drivers that are intended to benefit stockholders. 
As with other components of variable compensation, quantitative data in our peer comparator group is considered in determining our NEOs' annual short-term incentive compensation opportunity, and is presented to the Compensation Committee by Aon. We also consider other qualitative performance data and factors as described above. Based on these quantitative and qualitative factors, the Compensation Committee determined that the fiscal year 2018 annual incentive award opportunities for the NEOs would remain unchanged, as their annual incentive award opportunities were aligned with competitive levels. For additional information, see the market data comparisons under the caption "Compensation Philosophy and Strategy — Compensation Decisions Compared to Market Data." 
In fiscal year 2015, Company management finalized the Company's strategic plan for the next five years, which the Company refers to as "Woodward 150", as 2020 will mark the 150th anniversary of the Company's establishment. Similar to prior years, to help ensure that the Company's short-term incentive plan was aligned with the key focus areas that support Woodward 150, Company management worked with Aon to assess the performance metrics comprising the WVIP, and where appropriate, to identify other potential performance metrics for consideration that would support Woodward 150. Based on the outcome of that assessment, management of the Company identified and recommended to the Compensation Committee for its consideration certain modifications to the design of the WVIP, including changes in certain performance metrics for fiscal year 2018. At the September and November 2017 meetings of the Compensation Committee, the Committee determined that it would be appropriate to make the proposed changes to the design of the fiscal year 2018 WVIP to further align it with remaining objectives and targets under Woodward 150. Specifically, the Compensation Committee replaced aftermarket revenue with working capital improvement as a performance metric to enhance focus on improved free cash flow, which is a critical metric of business performance. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the modifications to the fiscal year 2018 WVIP will continue to drive the successful execution of Woodward 150, align pay and performance, enhance visibility for participants, and appropriately motivate performance in key areas of the business that are tied to stockholder value creation. 
For fiscal year 2018, actual Company achievement of the overarching performance goal of net earnings determined each NEO's maximum possible WVIP incentive payout: up to a maximum WVIP payout of 1.0% of net earnings for the Chairman & CEO, 0.4% of net earnings for the CFO, and 0.33% of net earnings for the Presidents of ATS and ICS, and 0.3% for the GC. Setting maximum WVIP incentive payouts in this manner motivates achievement of net earnings, which strongly ties to stockholder value creation. The Compensation Committee had the discretion to reduce, but not increase, actual WVIP payouts from the maximum that became available based on the overarching performance goals. 
At the time that the overarching and specific performance metrics were set, the Compensation Committee expected that each NEO's actual fiscal year 2018 WVIP payout would be lower than the maximum payment permitted upon achievement of the overarching performance goals. In particular, the specific performance metrics were intended to guide the Compensation Committee's use of negative discretion to determine WVIP payout amounts that were less than the maximum available based on the overarching performance goals. COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
For fiscal year 2018, the specific performance metrics are outlined in the table below and were designed using financial metrics as well as other performance metrics by business group. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT    CEO, CFO, GC (%)    OTHER NEOS (%) 
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT    CEO, CFO, GC (%)    OTHER NEOS (%) 
 Woodward Adjusted Earnings Per Share   50   35 
 Woodward Adjusted EBITDA Margin(1)   25   -   
 Woodward Strategic Performance Measures(2)   25   -   
 Business Group Adjusted OEAB Margin(3)   -   35 
 Business Group Strategic Performance Measures(4)   -   30 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Adjusted EBITDA Margin means Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) as a percentage of total Woodward sales.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Strategic Performance Measures for our CEO, CFO and GC consist of overall Company (i) Working Capital Improvement  (10% overall weighting) and (ii) Quality Improvement as measured through PPM percent decrease and Cost of Poor Quality decrease, weighted equally (a combined 15% overall weighting).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  Business Group Adjusted OEAB Margin means Adjusted OEAB (as defined below) as a percentage of the business group's  total sales.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  Strategic Performance Measures for our other NEOs consist of the applicable business group's (i) Working Capital  Improvement, and (ii) Quality Improvement as measured through PPM percent decrease and Cost of Poor Quality decrease. Each of the three foregoing Strategic Performance Metrics are weighted equally (10% each).  
[END TABLE]
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee used a similar approach to establishing the threshold and maximum Adjusted EPS objective as that which was used in prior years. For fiscal 2018, the threshold Adjusted EPS performance goal was set at 90% of the target goal and the maximum performance goal was set at 110% of target. The Compensation Committee determined that this approach continues to incentivize stretch levels of performance, balances pay and performance, represents a reasonable range of financial performance, and is in line with peer group practices. 
With respect to the approach used by the Compensation Committee to establish the threshold, target, and maximum performance goals for the other specific performance metrics, the Committee considered multiple factors that included, but were not limited to, historical performance, budgeted performance for fiscal 2018, and targeted levels of performance or improvement over multiple years. All of these metrics are established at a level that focuses on key business success factors that drive performance and challenge our management to achieve higher operational performance. Such targets are considered challenging, yet attainable, to achieve at the time they are set. 
For purposes of WVIP metrics applicable to all employees, including NEOs, for fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee established performance targets based on adjusted earnings per share for 2018. "Adjusted EPS", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted OEAB" mean the Company's reported diluted earnings per share, the Company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and a Business Group's operating earnings after bonus, respectively, in each case calculated without consideration to unusual non-operational income, gains, expenses or losses totaling in excess of 3% of the Company's net earnings, the Company's EBITDA, or the Business Group's OEAB (as applicable) for the fiscal year, including but not limited to any such items that are related to or associated with any: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a)  acquisitions or divestitures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b)  reorganization or restructuring activities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  c)  litigation or claim judgments or settlements;  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  d)  impact of any changes in or assumptions related to tax or other statutes, regulations or other applicable laws or  accounting principles, and in each case, that were not previously contemplated;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  e)  foreign exchange fluctuations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  f)  asset write-downs; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g)  other significant elements or items as provided in Section 11.2 of the Woodward 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan.   
[END TABLE]
Nonetheless, if at the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee believes that the achievement of the specific performance metrics under the WVIP plan is not reflective of the Company's expected level of financial, operating or other performance, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion modify the amount of any WVIP payout to be made under the plan, but not above the maximum WVIP incentives available based on achievement of the overarching net earnings goal. 
For fiscal year 2018, consideration of factors a) through f) above caused Adjusted EPS to be $0.57 higher than reported EPS. Specifically, upward adjustments were made for (i) expenses and earnings losses incurred in connection with M&A activities, (ii) restructuring and move-related charges, and (iii) an increase in the Company's share count as a result of the Company's decision to not resume share repurchases as previously intended; such upward adjustments were partially offset by net tax benefits associated with unplanned changes in tax laws. Similarly, upward adjustments with respect to Adjusted EBITDA for items (i) and (ii) above. Application of factors a) through f) above did not result in any other adjustments to the WVIP payouts. The following table reflects the metrics and performance with respect to Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted OEAB Margin components of the WVIP for our NEOs for 2018:

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Adjusted EPS was $3.39, and the payout for the portion of the WVIP that pertains to the Adjusted EPS performance metric was 94.3% of target. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was equal to 17.6%, and the payout for the portion of the WVIP that pertains to the Adjusted EBITDA performance metrics was 40% of target.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
The LTI Plan is a key component of the total compensation package. The Omnibus Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards. 
We generally issue two forms of awards under the LTI Plan – stock options and cash. We have determined that these two award forms are most appropriate for our NEOs due to their performance orientation and alignment with shareholder interests, as measured by stock price and financial performance, over the long-term. More specifically, we believe that stock options are aligned with shareholder interests because the awards do not convey value to recipients unless there is shareholder value creation after the date of grant. To balance long-term incentives based strictly on share price growth and to drive financial performance, we also grant cash awards under the Cash LTI Plan that are based on Woodward's 3-year financial performance. Specifically, the Cash LTI plan is based on two key financial metrics: Return on Capital and Net Earnings Per Share Growth, each of which is measured relative to companies of comparable size. In tandem, stock options and the Cash LTI Plan incent long-term financial performance that support the Company's stock price. 
These awards are intended to offer competitive incentive opportunities to our executives and to align their interests with increasing shareholder value. The aggregate value of these awards equals the sum of the total delivered value of the stock options (as determined using the Black-Scholes methodology) plus the target cash award opportunity, and represents the total long-term incentive compensation for each NEO. As with short-term incentive compensation, quantitative data in our peer comparator group is considered in determining our NEOs' long-term incentive compensation, and is presented to the Compensation Committee by Aon as discussed in "Compensation Decisions Compared to Market Data" above. We also consider other qualitative performance data and factors, including an individual NEO's performance, knowledge, skills, abilities, and significant contributions to the Company and shareholder value when establishing an award opportunity. Based on the considerations noted above, the Compensation Committee approved fiscal year 2018 long-term incentive award opportunities for the NEOs. For additional information, see the market data comparisons under the captions "Compensation Philosophy and Strategy" and "Compensation Decisions Compared to Market Data." 
At its regularly scheduled September meeting, the Compensation Committee approves a target delivered value for the stock option awards. The target value of each of the stock option awards is approved individually at this meeting. Typically one business day before the effective grant date of the award (such effective grant date being the first business day of the fiscal year), the Compensation Committee meets to establish the specific number of individual and aggregate awards based on the target delivered value and using a Black-Scholes value  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 calculated using the closing price on NASDAQ of the Company's stock on the day prior to such approval meeting. The exercise price of the stock option awards is also determined on the effective grant date and is not less than (and is typically equal to) the closing price as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on that day. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of stock options on September 29, 2017 at an exercise price of $78.97, which was the closing price of Woodward common stock as quoted on NASDAQ on the effective grant date (October 2, 2017). 
With respect to the Cash LTI, the Compensation Committee generally establishes a three-year performance period and compares the Company's performance to that of the companies comprising the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index. The Compensation Committee generally establishes the Cash LTI award metrics for a three-year performance cycle in the first quarter of the first fiscal year of the performance cycle preceding the first year of the performance cycle. For each NEO, the Compensation Committee also establishes a target Cash LTI, which is a percentage of the NEO's base salary at the beginning of the three-year performance cycle. The 2018-2020 performance period cycle was established in November 2017. The performance metrics for purposes of the Cash LTI for the multi-year cycles were determined by the Compensation Committee to be: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Return on Capital (50% weight)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net Earnings per Share (EPS) growth (50% weight)  
[END TABLE]
The performance metrics were selected because they are key measures to the success of the Company's business and aligned with shareholder value creation. Because the metrics are equally important to the Company, the performance metrics are weighted equally. 
For the purposes of measuring relative performance, "return on capital" is defined as net income, adjusted for accounting changes and after-tax interest expense, divided by the sum of total debt, stockholder's equity, and any non-controlling interest. EPS for this purpose is measured as net income, adjusted for accounting changes, if any, divided by fully diluted common shares outstanding. EPS during the performance cycle is compared to a baseline EPS to calculate the growth in diluted EPS during such cycle. There are currently three relevant cycles: 2016-2018 (basis is reported EPS for fiscal year ended 2015 of $2.75), 2017-2019 (basis is reported EPS for fiscal year ended 2016 of $2.85), and 2018-2020 (basis is reported EPS for fiscal year ended 2017 of $3.16). 
For purposes of developing the performance metrics for determining the payout under the Cash LTI, the Compensation Committee has approved a relative measure methodology that compares our performance to the companies in the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index, an external index. We believe that, for the Cash LTI, the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index relative measure methodology is an appropriate comparison of our performance against a larger and broader population of companies, which is representative of investment options available to the market. The Cash LTI performance metrics and corresponding payouts are based on our ranking within the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index for all performance cycles that are currently outstanding, and are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 At  50th percentile    50% of target 
 At  60th percentile    100% of target 
 At  75th percentile    200% of target 
[END TABLE]
The above payout formula applies to each measure weighted equally. If performance is below the 50th percentile, no award will be earned or paid as it relates to that measure. Award amounts are interpolated for performance results between the above percentiles. Performance at the 60th percentile is necessary to earn a payout of 100% of target as it relates to that measure. We believe having a target payout at the 60th percentile sets a higher standard and is consistent with plan designs of other high performing companies in our peer group. The maximum award that can be earned for performance at or above the 75th percentile is 200% of target as it relates to that measure.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
The reward targets established for each NEO are articulated as a percentage of base salary. These targets reflect the Compensation Committee's desire to establish a meaningful incentive linked to longer term financial performance of the Company that fits within our overall compensation philosophy and strategy. 
For the 2016-2018 Cash LTI cycle, targets and actual payouts are detailed in the following table:

METRIC     COMPANY  PERFORMANCE       ACTUAL PAYOUT AS A% OF TARGET           
METRIC     COMPANY  PERFORMANCE       ACTUAL PAYOUT AS A% OF TARGET

 Total           109.0           
[END TABLE]
These performance levels resulted in awards that aggregate to 109.0% of target for each NEO for the 2016-2018 cycle. The amounts paid under the Cash LTI ending in fiscal year 2018 can be found above and in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. 
Other Compensation Programs 
The NEOs are eligible to participate in the same health, welfare, and retirement benefits as all of our U.S. employee membership. These benefits include a group health insurance program; life insurance, inclusive of employee life, additional buy-up employee life, optional spouse life, and optional child life; Accidental Death & Dismemberment insurance; Short-Term Disability; Long-Term Disability; Woodward Retirement Savings Plan, inclusive of employee contributions and Company contributions (100% match on the first 3% of employee contributions, 50% on the next 3% of employee contributions, maxing at 4.5%); Woodward Stock Plan (Company contribution of 5% of eligible wages); and Retirement Income Plan (Company contribution of 1.5% of eligible wages, and 0.1% for each year of additional service). The Retirement Income Plan was closed to new participants as of September 30, 2003, with prior participants grandfathered. 
Our NEOs are also eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan, the Executive Benefit Plan (the "EBP"). The EBP is also available to other key members of management and to members of the Board. Employee participants are able to defer up to 50% of base salary, and up to 100% of any incentive (WVIP and/or Cash LTI) payments. 
All plans are subject to applicable limitations set by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). Supplemental contributions to the EBP (as more fully described below) are made for the Retirement Savings Plan, the Woodward Stock Plan, and the grandfathered Retirement Income Plan and are solely to restore for IRS limitations. 
The benefits described in this section are paid to remain competitive in the marketplace. Amounts relating to certain of these benefits may be found in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
Post-Employment Compensation and Employment Contracts 
The Company's NEOs are not employed under general employment contracts and are employees at will. 
We have entered into change in control agreements with each of the NEOs in order to help align actions and behaviors with, and in the best interests of, our stockholders in the event of a change of control transaction, to retain these executives through a change of control transaction and to enable them to remain focused on running the business to ensure a smooth transition. The change in control benefits are designed to preserve productivity, avoid disruption, and prevent attrition in the event we are involved in a change in control transaction. 
Severance benefits are intended to ease the consequences of an unexpected termination of employment. These benefits are also designed to prevent our senior executives from seeking employment with our competitors after termination or soliciting our employees or customers during a period after termination of employment. The change in control severance program also motivates executives to pursue transactions that are in our stockholders' best interests notwithstanding the potential negative impact of the transaction on their future employment. While cognizant of their terms, the Compensation Committee does not view the change in control agreements as an element of current compensation, and such arrangements do not necessarily affect the Compensation Committee's annual compensation decisions. 
For a further description of the change in control agreements, see the information under the caption "Executive Compensation — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control — Change in Control and Restrictive Covenant Agreements Post-Employment Provisions." 
Impact of Accounting and Tax Issues on Executive Compensation 
In setting each individual executive's compensation levels, we do not explicitly consider accounting and tax issues. We do, however, analyze the overall expense arising from aggregate executive compensation levels and awards and the components of our pay programs. 
As one of the factors in our evaluation of compensation matters, we have considered the anticipated tax treatment to the Company and to the executive officers of various payments and benefits. Through the end of our fiscal year 2018, Section 162(m) of the Code placed a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to our CEO and each of the next three most highly compensated executive officers other than the CFO. Certain performance-based compensation approved by stockholders was not subject to this limit in accordance with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code. The Omnibus Incentive Plan permits the payment of compensation, including stock options and cash-based performance awards, that is intended to qualify as performance-based under Section 162(m). However, to maintain flexibility in compensating our key executives, it is not a stated requirement under the Omnibus Incentive Plan that all compensation must be deductible. The Company and the Compensation Committee has and will continue to consider various approaches regarding the deductibility of compensation payments (including paying compensation that is not fully tax deductible) to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent consistent with our other compensation goals. However, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") effective for the first tax year commencing after December 31, 2017, which will apply to the Company beginning with the 2019 fiscal year, repealed the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption and also expands somewhat the number of executive officers subject to the $1,000,000 limit. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board has established stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors and executives to align their interests and objectives with those of our stockholders. Non-employee directors are committed to minimum ownership of our common stock of a value equal to 5 times the annual base retainer paid at the date of election  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued) 
 to the Board. The Chief Executive Officer is committed to minimum ownership value in an amount equal to 5 times his annual base salary, the Chief Financial Officer and Group Presidents are committed to a minimum ownership value equal to 3 times their respective annual base salaries, and Corporate Vice Presidents are committed to a minimum ownership value equal to 2 times their respective annual base salaries. Accumulation of the amount of stock required under the ownership guidelines is expected within 60 months of the date of such person's appointment or election. Shares held as owner of record or in brokerage account in the Woodward Retirement Savings Plan and unfunded deferred amounts denominated in Woodward Stock, all qualify towards the ownership guidelines. Unexercised and vested "in-the-money" stock options will also qualify towards up to a maximum of 50% of the ownership requirements. The Compensation Committee may in its discretion relieve any person of such obligations on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration special circumstances such as retirement or health of the individual. As of the date of this proxy statement filing, all directors and officers were in compliance with the ownership guidelines. 
Hedging and Pledging 
Under our written policies, no directors or employees of the Company are permitted to purchase our stock on margin, or to short sell, buy or sell puts or calls, or to engage in any other transaction related to Woodward securities that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Woodward securities. In addition, directors and employees of the Company are not permitted to pledge Woodward stock under any circumstances. 
Clawback Policy 
In 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a Clawback Policy, which the Board believes exceeds or meets the forthcoming requirements pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The Clawback Policy provides for the recovery by the Company, from any current or former executive officer who was employed by the Company during the three-year look back period ("Covered Person"), of any incentive-based compensation that was determined, in whole or in part, on the achievement of any financial or operating result of the Company, that was awarded erroneously to the Covered Person due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. A copy of the Clawback Policy is available at http://www.woodward.com/ClawbackPolicy.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, that might incorporate this Proxy Statement, in whole or in part, the following Woodward, Inc. Compensation Committee Report on Compensation Discussion and Analysis shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any such previous or future filings. 
The Compensation Committee is charged with certain responsibilities relating to compensation of the Company's executive officers. The Compensation Committee evaluates and approves all compensation of executive officers, including base salaries, short-term and long-term incentive compensation, and any perquisite programs of the Company. Compensation Committee determinations are presented to the Board. 
The Compensation Committee also fulfills its duties with respect to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Compensation Committee Report portions of the proxy statement, as described in the Compensation Committee's charter. 
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis was prepared by management of the Company. The Company is responsible for the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and for the disclosure controls relating to executive compensation. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis is not a report or disclosure of the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee met with management of the Company and the Compensation Committee's outside consultant to review and discuss the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement and the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the management of the Company. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Board approved that recommendation.

Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table 
Stock option awards consist of non-qualified options issued for a 10-year term. Each option tranche granted to eligible recipients, including NEOs, vests over four years at the rate of 25% per year. The exercise price represents the Woodward  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued) 
 closing price as reported on NASDAQ on the effective date of the award. If employment is terminated (other than for reasons as described below), the options granted will be cancelled unless exercised within three months following the date of termination or the term of the option whichever is earlier. For stock options granted prior to October 1, 2013, if the termination is due to retirement, all outstanding options vest and must be exercised within three years from the date of retirement or the term of the option, whichever is earlier. For stock option awards granted on or after October 1, 2013, upon a termination of employment due to retirement, options will not accelerate and will continue to vest and be exercisable in accordance with the schedule established at the grant date. For the foregoing purposes, our directors are eligible for retirement upon attaining age 55, and the NEOs are eligible for retirement upon attaining age 55 with at least ten years of service with us or age 65 with no minimum years of service. Dividend equivalents are not paid on unexercised stock option awards. 
The WVIP and the Cash LTI are presented in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table because each is a cash-based performance award. The actual amounts of the awards under the WVIP and the Cash LTI listed in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column were paid in November 2018. The awards under both plans as set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table are based on Threshold/Target/Maximum percentages applied to base wages as of the beginning of the fiscal year. If employment is terminated, the employee must have had full-time employee status at the end of the fiscal year, in the case of the WVIP, or at the end of the last fiscal year of the multi-year period, in the case of the Cash LTI, to receive a payout under both plans. If the termination is due to retirement, the payouts under both plans will be prorated. In either event, the payouts under both plans will be based on actual goal performance. Please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for additional information relating to these provisions, including performance criteria relating to these plans.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued)

Narrative Disclosure of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table 
The EBP is a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow for supplemental retirement savings above the limits imposed by the IRS. If deferrals are above the Code limits on eligible compensation, then the account is credited by the Company with a percentage "match" contribution equivalent to that available under our Woodward Retirement Savings Plan. All contributions are made on a tax-deferred basis. Eligible participants are selected to participate based on criteria that includes incentive level, salary level and significant accountability to produce or contribute to key business results. Amounts deferred into the EBP are indexed to the same investment alternatives available to all eligible participants under the Retirement Savings Plan. Investment into Woodward common stock is generally permitted, except that supplemental contributions by the Company to the EBP are not permitted to initially be deemed invested in Woodward stock. Eligible employee participants may defer up to 50% of base salary for a plan year and up to 100% of cash incentive compensation. All elections must be made in advance of the plan year. At the time of the deferral election, the  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued) 
 participant must designate the time and form of distribution. Distributions may be elected upon retirement or termination of employment. Distributions may also be elected for future dates during employment; however, any future date selected must be at least five plan years after the plan year in which the deferral is credited to the account. Distributions may be modified if executed a year before the originally scheduled distribution date. Distributions from the plan are made in cash; however, any payment made that is attributable to the portion of the participant's account deemed invested in Company stock is made in whole shares of Company stock with fractional shares paid in cash. Amounts included in the EBP are 100% vested at all times. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
This section explains the payments and benefits to which the NEOs would be entitled in various termination of employment scenarios. These are hypothetical situations only, as we currently employ all of the NEOs. For purposes of this explanation and these scenarios, we have assumed that termination of employment and change-in-control occurred on September 28, 2018, the last business day of our 2018 fiscal year. 
The intent of this section is to isolate those payments and benefits for which the amount, vesting, or time of payment is altered by the termination of employment in the described circumstances. This section does not cover all amounts the NEOs would receive following termination. Specifically they are entitled to COBRA, life insurance conversion, and payouts from their Retirement Savings Plan; however, all employees are entitled to these benefits. In addition, the NEOs would receive the amounts earned under the short-term incentive plan and long-term incentive plan for the performance periods ending on September 30, 2018 (see Summary Compensation Table, non-equity incentive column). 
Retirement 
The age and years of service of the NEOs as of September 30, 2018 were as follows:

Death 
If a NEO dies while employed, the post-termination benefit consists of (for this purpose the date of death is assumed to be the last day of fiscal year 2018): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive payouts from the Cash LTI compensation program to beneficiaries; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Acceleration of vesting of non-qualified stock option awards (the value in this  column represents the shares that vested due to this provision, with a market price as of the last day of fiscal year 2018).  
[END TABLE]
NEOs who are retirement eligible receive, upon retirement, continued vesting (in accordance with the original vesting schedule) of any then-unvested options. Accordingly, death of an NEO would not result in vesting of any stock options that otherwise would have been forfeited for such retirement-eligible NEOs, although it would result in immediate vesting of such options. See "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End" table above for information regarding unvested ("Unexercisable") options.

Disability 
If a NEO becomes totally and permanently disabled while employed (the date of disability is assumed to be the last day of the fiscal year), the post termination benefits consist of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A monthly payment under the Woodward, Inc. Long-Term Disability plan available to all employees;

Change in Control and Restrictive Covenant Agreements Post-Employment Provisions 
We have entered into transitional compensation agreements with certain of our officers, including all of our NEOs, which become operative only in the event of a qualifying termination following a Change of Control or other specified event. 
For purposes of these agreements, a change in control occurs if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any person, entity, or group (with certain exceptions) becomes the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the combined voting  power of the then-outstanding shares of Woodward common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• There is a change in a majority of the Board during any consecutive 12-month  period, other than by election or nomination by a vote of two-thirds of the Board members as of the beginning of the period (such individuals or any such new directors, the "Incumbent Board");   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Woodward's stockholders approve a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or share exchange, and in any such case,  which is consummated and results in Woodward's stockholders owning less than 51% of the combined voting power of the surviving corporation following the transaction; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During any consecutive 12 month period, Woodward sells or disposes of at least 40% of the total gross fair market value of  the Company's assets in one or more transactions, unless after such transaction(s): (i) the Company's stockholders continue to hold 51% of voting power of the Company following the transaction, and (ii) at least a majority of the  members of the Board following the transaction(s) were members of the Incumbent Board prior to the transaction(s).  
[END TABLE]
If, following a change in control (but prior to the second anniversary of the occurrence thereof), the executive's employment is terminated by Woodward (other than for cause or due to death or disability), or the executive terminates with good reason (as defined in the agreement), 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive would receive an amount (payable in a lump sum) equal to: (1) the executive's unpaid base salary,  accrued vacation pay, unreimbursed business expenses, and any other accrued obligations owed by the Company to the executive; (2) a payment equal to the Company's cost to provide the executive with two years continued health and welfare  benefit coverage under Company-provided plans; (3) a payment equal to two years of contributions the Company would have made on behalf of the executive to its tax-qualified defined contribution retirement  plan(s); (4) a payment, pro-rated based on relevant service, of the greater of the then-current year's annual incentive award target or actual amount earned based on annualized year-to-date performance; (5) a payment, pro-rated based on relevant service, of the greater of target or the actual amount earned  based on annualized year-to-date performance of all outstanding Cash LTI performance cycles; and (6) 100% (200% in the case of our CFO) of the sum of the  executive's annual base salary and target annual incentive; and  
[END TABLE]
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In consideration for the executive to enter into restrictive covenants in the event of a qualifying termination following a  Change of Control covering: Noncompetition, Confidentiality, Nonsolicitation, Cooperation, and Nondisparagement, the executive would receive an incremental amount (payable in a lump sum) equal to 100% of the sum of the executive's annual base  salary and target annual incentive.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, all unvested stock option awards would be accelerated and become immediately exercisable. 
The following table describes the payments and benefits that are triggered by the occurrence of a change in control and the termination of employment following a change in control. For purposes of this table, we have assumed the exercise of stock options on September 28, 2018, the last business day of fiscal year 2018, at the closing price on that day of $80.86 per share. NEOs who are retirement eligible receive, upon retirement, continued vesting (in accordance with the original vesting schedule) of any then-unvested options, even in the absence of a change in control. Accordingly, a change in control would not result in vesting of any stock options that otherwise would have been forfeited for such retirement-eligible NEOs, although it would result in immediate vesting of such options.

If the payments described above would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, the Company would not provide reimbursement to the executive for any excise taxes  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued) 
 imposed. In some instances, the executive may be subject to a 20% excise tax on a portion of the severance and other benefits payable upon a change in control. In such cases, the company does not provide a tax gross-up. However, the amount payable to the executive may be reduced to eliminate the excise tax, but only if the net-of-tax result to the executive is better than paying the excise tax. 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Pursuant to Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and SEC rules, we are required to disclose the ratio of our principal executive officer's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee. During fiscal 2018, the principal executive officer of Woodward was the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Gendron. For 2018, Mr. Gendron's annual total compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 45 was $6,101,564, and our median employee's annual total compensation was $61,747, resulting in a pay ratio of approximately 98.8 to 1. 
In accordance with SEC rules, we identified the median employee as of July 1, 2018 by (i) aggregating for each applicable employee for the 12 month period from July 1 , 2017 through June 30, 2018 (A) regular pay received, (B) overtime paid, (C) pay premiums or differentials received, (D) sick pay received, (E) on-call pay received, and (F) vacation pay received, and (ii) ranking this aggregate compensation measure for our employees from lowest to highest. This calculation was performed for all employees of Woodward excluding Mr. Gendron, except as disclosed below. No annualizations were performed for employees hired or who took unpaid leave during fiscal 2018. 
For purposes of identifying the median employee, all individuals acquired through Woodward's acquisition of L'Orange GmbH in June 2018, totaling approximately 1,100 employees, were excluded from the analysis as permitted by SEC rules. Additionally, and independent of our application of the merger exception as indicated in the prior sentence, individuals (with corresponding number of employees) who were employed in the United Kingdom (74), India (64), Japan (59), Brazil (33), The Netherlands (30), Korea (13), Australia (3), France (3), Italy (2), Saudi Arabia (2), and United Arab Emirates (2) were excluded from the employee population, for purposes of this disclosure, pursuant to the de minimis exemption as permitted by SEC rules. After taking into consideration the foregoing exceptions, on July 1, 2018, we had 5,940 U.S. employees and 1,561 non-U.S. employees. Ignoring application of the de minimis exemption (but still excluding all individuals acquired through the acquisition of L'Orange GmbH), on the same date we had 5,940 U.S. employees and 1,846 non-U.S. employees. 
The pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our internal records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. Therefore, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act that might incorporate this Proxy Statement in whole or in part, the information set forth above under "Board Meetings and Committees — Audit Committee," relating to the charter of the Audit Committee and the independence of the Audit Committee members, and the following report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any such previous or future filings. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including maintaining an effective system of internal control over the Company's financial reporting. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to in this report, we recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2018, be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended September 30, 2018. Our recommendation was based on our review and discussion of the audited financial statements with management, and our discussions with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements. 
In addition, our recommendation was based on our discussion with Deloitte & Touche LLP of the matters required to be discussed under Auditing Standard No. 1301, as amended. We also discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP their independence, received from them the written disclosures and the letter required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, and considered whether the provision of services other than audit services (the fees for which are disclosed in the table that follows) is compatible with maintaining their independence. We based our recommendation on the foregoing discussions, disclosures and considerations.

Audit Committee's Policy on Pre-Approval of Services Provided by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, the Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. Under the established policy, all audit and tax services and related fees require the specific approval of the Audit Committee. For audit-related services and all other services, the Audit Committee has determined specific services and dollar thresholds under which such services would be considered pre-approved. To the extent that management requests services other than these pre-approved services, or beyond the dollar thresholds, the Audit Committee must specifically approve the services. In situations where approval of such services is required prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to approve such services to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Furthermore, under the established policy, the independent registered public accounting firm is prohibited from performing the non-audit services identified by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") as prohibited. The policy also requires management to periodically prepare reports for the Audit Committee on the Company's use of the independent registered public accounting firm.

Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The following table represents fees for professional audit services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 and fees billed for other services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP during that period. All of such fees were approved in accordance with the Pre-approval Policy described above.

[END TABLE]
In November 2018, the Audit Committee recommended and approved the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. The decision of the Audit Committee to appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP was based on careful consideration of the firm's qualifications as an independent registered public accounting firm. Deloitte & Touche LLP was originally selected by the Audit Committee as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective December 6, 2007. 
Although the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of any independent registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the Company, the Audit Committee and the Board are requesting, as a matter of policy, that stockholders ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. The Audit Committee is not required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. However, if the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee would investigate the reasons for the stockholders' rejection and would consider whether to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP or to appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
A proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP for the current year will be presented at the Annual Meeting. A representative from Deloitte & Touche LLP is expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires to do so, and be available to answer appropriate questions. 
Your Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm presented in Proposal 2.  PROPOSAL 3 – ADVISORY RESOLUTION REGARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are offering our stockholders an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. Additionally, and in response to the advisory vote of our stockholders at our 2016 Annual Meeting regarding the recommended frequency of such an advisory resolution, we have presented this proposal to stockholders on an annual basis. Although the vote is non-binding, we value continuing and constructive feedback from our stockholders on compensation and other important matters. The Board and the Compensation Committee will consider the voting results when making future compensation decisions. 
As described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, we believe that our executive compensation program (1) provides a competitive total compensation program that enables us to attract, retain and motivate a high-performance executive management team, and (2) aligns the interests of the NEOs with the interests of our stockholders in different ways, by focusing on both short-term and long-term performance goals, by promoting ownership of the Company, and by linking individual performance to our fundamental financial performance. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We encourage long-term stock ownership by our executive officers with award features, such as graduated vesting on stock  option award tranches at 25% per year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual incentive compensation plans are aligned between Company executives and all other employees of the Company to  promote unified achievement of Company goals and objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We establish total compensation (base salary, annual short-term cash incentives, and long-term incentives) for each NEO  that is competitive with total compensation for executives in comparable positions at companies in our peer comparator group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We place a strong emphasis on variable compensation, which is designed so that the payout opportunity is directly linked to  the achievement of pre-determined financial performance metrics, with upside opportunity for exceeding the pre-determined goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our allocation of cash compared to non-cash compensation is weighted significantly  toward cash-based compensation in order to (1) minimize the extent to which the interests of existing stockholders are diluted by equity used as compensation and (2) balance operating performance with delivering returns to our  stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In light of our fiscal year 2018 financial results, we believe that the compensation paid to our NEOs in fiscal year 2018  was aligned with our financial performance for the reasons discussed under the caption "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Compensation Philosophy and Strategy — Fiscal Year 2018 Pay for Performance."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have stock ownership guidelines that require our CEO to own shares of our common stock equal to 5 times annual base  salary; our CFO and business group Presidents to own shares of our common stock equal to 3 times annual base salary; and our Corporate Vice Presidents to own shares of our common stock equal to 2 times annual base salary, other than in special  circumstances as may be determined by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that proper administration of our executive compensation program should result in the development of a management team that improves our fundamental financial performance and provides value to the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. Additional information relevant to your vote can be found in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation" sections of this proxy statement.  PROPOSAL 3 – ADVISORY RESOLUTION REGARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (continued) 
For these reasons, we recommend that stockholders vote in favor of the following advisory resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Woodward's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion presented in Woodward's proxy statement for its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, is hereby APPROVED." 
Your Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" this advisory resolution.  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
At the 2016 Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company approved the Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the stockholders of the Company approved the Amended and Restated Woodward, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (together, the "Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan" or the "Omnibus Incentive Plan"). The Woodward Board of Directors (the "Board") has adopted certain amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to stockholder approval. Stockholders are now being asked to approve such amendments, as described herein. 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan is intended to attract and retain the best available individuals for positions of substantial responsibility, and to provide to such individuals additional incentives that are aligned with and promote the success of the Company. The Omnibus Incentive Plan also is intended to encourage stock ownership by employees, consultants, or non-employee directors who are granted awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan ("Participants"), thereby further aligning their interests with those of the Company's stockholders. 
The amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan that are being submitted for stockholder approval include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1,400,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The addition of a "fungible share" provision, under which any award other than a stock option or stock  appreciation right and which is settled in shares (a "Full Value Award") that is made on or after the 2018 Annual Meeting will reduce the number of shares remaining under the share authorization under the Omnibus Incentive Plan by two  shares for each share actually subject to any such Full Value Award. This provision is in replacement of the former provision in the Omnibus Incentive Plan that capped the total number of Full Value Awards that could be granted under the Omnibus  Incentive Plan to 200,000 shares in the aggregate; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The specification that no dividends will be paid on shares that are covered by unexercised stock options or stock  appreciation rights.  
[END TABLE]
Other than as described above, no material changes to the Omnibus Incentive Plan are proposed. 
Determination of Number of Shares to Add to the Omnibus Incentive Plan 
In determining the number of additional shares to propose to make available under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Board considered the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Remaining Competitive. The Omnibus Incentive Plan plays an important role in our effort to align the interests of  Participants and stockholders. Moreover, in our industry, equity compensation awards are an important tool in recruiting, retaining and motivating highly qualified technical and other key employees, upon whose efforts our success is dependent.

• Potential Dilution. The potential dilution from the additional 1,400,000 shares to be added to the Omnibus Incentive  Plan is 2.27%, based on total shares outstanding as of September 30, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Past Usage of Shares. Over the past three fiscal years, the Company's average annual dilution from grants under  the Omnibus Incentive Plan was 1.36%. Dilution for this purpose was calculated as the number of equity awards granted during the fiscal year, less cancellations, as a percentage of total outstanding shares as of the end of that fiscal year.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Future Use of Shares. In determining projected share usage, the Compensation Committee considered a forecast that  included the following factors: (1) the 1,276,825 shares that remained available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan as of September 30, 2018; (2) the additional 1,400,000 shares that would be available for grant under the Omnibus Incentive  Plan, if stockholders approve the amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan; (3) estimated cancellations that may return to the Omnibus Incentive Plan  
[END TABLE]

     in the future; and (4) forecasted future grants. After considering these factors, we currently anticipate that the shares under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will be sufficient for our purposes  for approximately 1-2 years. However, future circumstances and changes in our business needs may result in the shares being exhausted earlier or later than this estimate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overhang. The Compensation Committee also considered "overhang," which measures the number of shares  subject to equity awards outstanding but unexercised, plus the number of shares available to be granted, as a percentage of total shares outstanding. As of September 30, 2018, we had 5,611,469 stock options that were awarded and remained  outstanding, all of which were granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan or our expired 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). 4,109,650 of this total were outstanding under the 2006 Plan. We had no stock appreciation rights  outstanding as of that date. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the outstanding stock options as of September 30, was 5.6 years and the weighted-average exercise price per Share of those stock options was $45.42. Also, as of  September 30, 2018, we had 10,300 Full Value Awards that were awarded and remained outstanding, all of which were granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The foregoing, together with the 1,276,825 shares remaining available for future grant  under the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 1,400,000 shares to be added to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, would represent approximately 4.33% of our total outstanding common shares as of September 30, 2018. No shares remain available for grant under  the 2006 Plan.  
[END TABLE]
In developing the number of shares to add to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Board considered proxy advisory firm guidelines in order to increase the likelihood of a positive recommendation from those firms, as well projected future share usage needs for the Company to be able to make competitive grants to Participants. 
Why Stockholders Should Approve the Amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity awards are an important component of the Company's compensation program. The Omnibus Incentive Plan,  including the amendments described herein, will help the Company to continue to attract and retain the services of qualified employees, officers and non-employee directors (such directors, "Outside  Directors").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity incentives align the interests of our employees, officers and Outside Directors with those of other stockholders.  Equity incentives appropriately incent recipients to focus on growth in stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares Remaining Available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may be Insufficient. The Shares that remain available  under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may be insufficient for our future needs in attracting, retaining and motivating our employees, officers and Outside Directors.  
[END TABLE]
Effect of Stockholder Approval of Amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan 
If stockholders approve the amendments described herein to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, such new version will supersede the version of the Omnibus Incentive Plan that was approved by stockholders at our last Annual Meeting. If stockholders do not approve the additional amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan described herein, we will continue to use the version of the Omnibus Incentive Plan that was approved by stockholders at our last Annual Meeting, with the addition of the provisions that no dividends will be paid on shares that are covered by unexercised stock options or stock appreciation rights. However, absent the share increase proposed herein, the shares that remain available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may not, in the future, be sufficient for us to be able to achieve our goals of attracting, motivating and retaining our employees through grants of equity awards.  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan Summary 
The following is a summary of the principal features of the Omnibus Incentive Plan as proposed to be further amended. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, inclusive of the proposed additional amendments, which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A. Any terms not capitalized but not defined herein shall take the meaning ascribed to them in the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan permits the Company to grant various types of incentive awards, including: (1) stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock, (4) performance units, (5) performance shares, (6) restricted stock units, (7) other stock-based awards, (8) annual incentive awards, and (9) cash-based awards (individually, an "Award," and collectively, "Awards"). The Omnibus Incentive Plan limits the awards that an individual Participant may receive in any fiscal year of the Company ("Fiscal Year"). Specifically, a Participant may receive during any fiscal year: (i) no more than 600,000 Shares subject to stock options and stock appreciation rights (subject to an additional award of up to 900,000 Shares in the fiscal year of hire); (ii) no more than 150,000 Shares subject to Full Value Awards (subject to an additional award of an additional 50,000 Shares in the fiscal year of hire); and (iii) the maximum amount that may be paid for all performance periods ending during a Fiscal Year) with respect to cash-based Awards is $10,000,000. No Outside Director may be granted Awards which, in the aggregate, exceed $300,000 in grant date fair value (calculated under generally accepted accounting principles), provided that such amount is increased to $450,000 in the Fiscal Year of his or her initial service as an Outside Director. Any Awards or other compensation provided to an Outside Director for his or her services as a consultant or employee are excluded from these Outside Director Award limitations. 
Shares Reserved 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of Awards with respect to an aggregate of 4,200,000 shares of common stock of the Company, of which 1,400,000 are being added subject to stockholder approval. These 1,400,000 shares equal approximately 2.26 percent of the Company's outstanding shares as of November 26, 2018. Shares issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may either be (i) authorized but unissued shares or (ii) shares that have been or may be reacquired in the open market, in private transactions, or otherwise. As of November 26, 2018, the closing price of our common stock on NASDAQ was $82.01 per share. 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan does not permit what is known as liberal share recycling. Upon exercise of a stock appreciation right settled in shares, the gross number of shares covered by the portion of the Award so exercised will cease to be available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Shares that have been actually issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to any Award will not be returned to the Omnibus Incentive Plan and will not become available for future grant or sale under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, except that if unvested shares of Full Value Awards are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, those shares will become available for future grant or sale under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (unless the Omnibus Incentive Plan is terminated). Shares used to pay the exercise price or purchase price of an Award, acquired in open market transactions using option proceeds, and/or used to satisfy withholding taxes related to the Award will not be available for future grant or sale under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. For purposes of clarification, no shares purchased by the Company with proceeds received from the exercise of an option will become available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
If an option or stock appreciation right expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, then the unexercised shares subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. If a Full Value Award is forfeited or repurchased by the Company, then the forfeited or repurchased shares subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. To the extent an Award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan.  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
Furthermore, any Full Value Award that is granted on or after January 30, 2019 will reduce the number of shares remaining under the share authorization by two shares for each share actually subject to the Full Value Award. If any part of such a Full Value Award is forfeited, repurchased by the Company due to a failure to vest, paid out in cash, or returned to the Omnibus Incentive Plan for any other reason set forth in the Omnibus Incentive Plan, an equal amount (that is, twice the number of Full Value Awards being forfeited or cancelled) will be returned to the Omnibus Incentive Plan and will increase accordingly the number of shares remaining under the share authorization. 
Administration 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee or another committee as may be delegated in accordance with the Omnibus Incentive Plan or as described in the "Delegation of Authority" section above (the "Committee"). To the extent deemed desirable by the Board or the Committee, the Committee consists of at least two directors, both of whom qualify as "non-employee directors" under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as "outside directors" under Code Section 162(m). Except to the extent prohibited by applicable laws, the Committee may delegate to one or more individuals the day-to-day administration of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and/or any of the functions assigned to the Committee in the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Any such delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time. 
Subject to the other provisions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Board or Committee (as applicable) will have the authority, in its discretion: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a)  to select the employees, Outside Directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries ("Service  Providers") to whom Awards may be granted;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b)  to determine the number of shares or dollar amount to be covered by each Award;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  c)  to approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Omnibus Incentive Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  d)  to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, of any Award based  in each case on such factors as the Committee will determine, including, but not limited to, the exercise price of an Award, the time or times when Awards vest or may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting  acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the shares relating thereto;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  e)  to construe and interpret the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and each Award;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g)  to modify or amend each Award, including, but not limited to, the discretionary authority to accelerate the vesting of  Awards (notwithstanding the one year minimum vesting schedule described below), to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Awards and to extend the maximum term of an option (but in no event longer than 10 years from the date of the  Award);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  h)  to determine the manner in which Participants may satisfy any applicable tax obligations;

[END TABLE]
 PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  k)  to impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Committee determines appropriate as to the timing and  manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares issued as a result of or under an Award, including without limitation, (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy,  (ii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (iii) requirements for holding shares in order to comply with share ownership policies or guidelines adopted by the Company from time to  time; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  l)  to require that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award (including amounts received  upon the settlement or exercise of an Award) will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance criteria of an Award,  as may be specified in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, or later if (i) applicable laws require the Company to adopt a policy requiring such reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment, or (ii) pursuant to an amendment of an  outstanding Award; to make all other determinations the Committee deems necessary or advisable for administering the Omnibus Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer limited authority to make certain equity grants of non-qualified stock options, Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan during the interval between regularly scheduled meetings of the Compensation Committee, which authority would continue under amendments described herein. The Chief Executive Officer is not authorized to (i) make interim equity grants to members of the Board or to elected officers of the Company, or (ii) make, to any individual, any interim equity grant that is greater than 15,000 nonqualified stock options or 5,000 shares of Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Stock Awards. The Board at any time may revoke the authority of the Chief Executive Officer to make interim grants. 
Eligibility 
Service Providers (including the persons named in the Summary Compensation Table below) will be eligible to be selected to receive Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The actual number of individuals who will receive Awards cannot be determined in advance because the Committee has the discretion to select the Participants. As of November 26, 2018, approximately 9,111 persons, including approximately 8,523 employees, 579 independent contractors, and 9 Outside Directors, were eligible to be selected to receive Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of the same date, 178 persons, including 168 employees, 10 current and former Outside Directors, and 0 independent contractors had been granted Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Duration 
The amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan would be effective January 30, 2019, subject to an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this Proposal 4 at the Annual Meeting. No options intended to be incentive stock options may be granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan after September 13, 2026, unless further stockholder approval (after the 2018 Annual Meeting) is obtained. 
Adjustments 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for equitable adjustment by the Committee, in the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, reincorporation, reclassification, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the shares occurs. In the event of any such occurrence, the Committee, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, will adjust the number and class of shares of stock that may be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the number, class and price of  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
 shares of stock covered by each outstanding Award, and/or the numerical share limits under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
No Repricings 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan expressly prohibits option repricing and certain other actions known as an "Exchange Program." The Committee may not implement an Exchange Program (as defined) unless stockholders approve an amendment to the Omnibus Incentive Plan that permits the implementation of an Exchange Program. We are not requesting stockholders to approve any such amendment at this time. 
No Dividends or Distributions on Unvested Awards 
Any dividends or distributions on unvested shares subject to Full Value Awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will not be paid immediately to the Participant and instead will be subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying shares on which the dividend or distribution is paid. In addition, no dividends or distributions will be paid on any unexercised shares covered by stock options or stock appreciation rights. Notwithstanding the preceding, adjustments may be made in unvested Awards as provided in "Adjustments" above. 
Minimum Vesting Requirements 
No Award (other than cash-based Awards) will be scheduled to vest earlier than the one-year anniversary of the grant date of such Award unless the Participant dies or becomes disabled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Awards that result in the issuance of an aggregate of up to five percent (5%) of the total shares available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may be granted with vesting schedules that do not follow the minimum one year vesting rule, and (b) after a stock-based Award has been granted, the Committee has discretion to accelerate the vesting of an Award. In addition, as explained below under "Change in Control," Awards will accelerate vesting if they are not assumed by a successor entity, notwithstanding the minimum one year vesting schedule. The minimum one year vesting schedule does not apply to the cash-based annual incentive, other cash-based Awards, stock options Awards, or stock appreciation rights granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan prior to January 24, 2018. 
Options 
The exercise price of each option will be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that such exercise price may generally not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of a share on the effective grant date of the Award. The maximum term of each option will be ten (10) years from its effective grant date or such shorter term as may be provided by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee will determine whether the options are intended to be incentive stock options (which may receive more favorable tax treatment to the Participant under the Code) or nonqualified stock options (which do not qualify as incentive stock options). 
The Committee may provide for the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an option, including the method of payment. Such consideration may consist of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a)  cash;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b)  check;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  c)  promissory note, to the extent permitted by applicable laws;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  d)  other shares, provided that such shares have a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise  price for the shares with respect to which such option will be exercised and provided that accepting such shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company, as the Committee determines in its sole discretion;   
[END TABLE]

  e)  consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted (or other) cashless exercise program (whether through a  broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company in connection with the Omnibus Incentive Plan;  
[END TABLE]

  f)  by net exercise;  
[END TABLE]

  g)  such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of shares to the extent permitted by applicable laws; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  h)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.  
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted Stock Awards consist of shares transferred to Participants, without payment, as additional compensation for their services to the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Restricted stock units consist of a contractual right of the Participant to receive shares, or cash equal in value to those shares, in the future, without payment, as additional compensation for their services to the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Restricted Stock Awards and restricted stock units awarded under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee determines are appropriate, including without limitation, restrictions on the sale or other disposition of such shares. The Committee may impose such restrictions on restricted shares as it may deem advisable or appropriate, and may set vesting criteria for restricted stock units based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued status as a service provider), applicable federal or state securities laws or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
Each stock appreciation right provides the award recipient the right to receive an amount equal to the number of shares corresponding to the stock appreciation right exercised, multiplied by the amount by which the Company's common stock price exceeds the exercise price on the date of exercise. The Company's obligation arising upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right may be paid in shares or in cash, or any combination thereof, as the Committee may determine. The exercise price of each stock appreciation right will be determined in advance by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement; provided, however, that such exercise price generally may not be less than the fair market value of a share on the effective grant date of the Award. The maximum term of each stock appreciation right will be ten years from its effective grant date or such shorter term as may be provided in advance by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. 
Performance Units and Performance Shares 
The Committee may grant performance units and/or performance shares. Each performance unit will have an initial value that is established by the Committee on or before the Grant Date. Each performance share will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of a share on the grant date. The Committee will set performance objectives or other vesting provisions in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of performance units/shares that will be paid out to the Participant. The Committee may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued status as a service provider), applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Committee in its discretion. 
Performance Goals 
The Plan permits (but does not require) awards to be granted subject to performance-based vesting criteria that the Committee deems appropriate, including specific performance goals intended to allow awards to qualify as  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
 "performance-based" compensation under Code Section 162(m) if certain requirements were met, which, prior to the enactment of the TCJA allowed us to preserve the deductibility of certain compensation, as described further below. The TCJA eliminated the performance-based exception for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, except for certain grandfathered arrangements. Although this performance-based exception has been eliminated, the specific performance goals related to this exception remain in the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Committee, in its discretion may (but is not required to) provide that one or more of such performance goals must be satisfied before an Award vests. For example, the Committee may choose performance goals relating to cash flow, earnings, product and operational metrics, revenue or total shareholder return. Performance goals are measured over one or more specified periods referred to as performance periods. Performance periods may not be shorter than one fiscal quarter. The maximum duration of performance periods under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is twenty fiscal quarters. Any performance goals may be measured: (1) in absolute terms, (2) in combination with more than one performance goal (for example, as a price/earnings ratio goal by combining total shareholder return (share price) and earnings performance goals), (3) in relative terms (including, but not limited to, as compared to results for other periods of time, and/or against another company or companies or index or indices), (4) with respect to equity, assets or human resources (for example, on a per-share or per-capita basis), (5) against the performance of the Company as a whole or a business unit or units or products of the Company, (6) on a pre-tax or after-tax basis, and/or (7) on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) or non-GAAP basis. The Committee may determine whether any element(s) or item(s) will be included in or excluded from the calculation of any performance goal with respect to any Participants. The Committee, in its discretion, also may choose additional or other performance objectives not listed above, which objectives generally may be measured over a specified period as the Committee determines. 
Covered Employee Annual Incentive Awards 
Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Committee may designate certain employees as eligible to receive a payment with respect to a fiscal year based on a percentage of an incentive pool equal to the greatest of: (a) three percent (3%) of the Company's consolidated operating earnings for the fiscal year, (b) two percent (2%) of the Company's operating cash flow for the fiscal year, or (c) five percent (5%) of the Company's net income for the fiscal year. The Committee will allocate an incentive pool percentage to each eligible employee for each fiscal year. In no event may (i) the incentive pool percentage for any one employee exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total pool, or (ii) the sum of the incentive pool percentages for all eligible employees exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the total pool. 
Cash-Based Awards 
The Committee may grant other cash-based Awards in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Each cash-based Award will specify a payment amount or payment range (which may be expressed as a percentage of the Participant's base salary, a dollar amount or a result of a formula or other matrix), as determined by the Committee. The Committee may, but is not required to, establish performance or vesting criteria that will determine the number and/or value of cash-based Awards paid out to a Participant. The maximum amount that may be paid for all performance periods ending during Fiscal Year with respect to cash based awards is $10 million. 
Other Stock-Based Awards 
The Committee may grant other stock-based Awards not otherwise described by the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted shares, in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Such Awards may involve the transfer of  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
 actual shares to Participants, or the payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares and may include, without limitation, Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United States. Such Awards may be expressed in terms of shares or units based on shares, as determined by the Committee. The Committee may, but is not required to, establish performance or vesting criteria that will determine the number and/or value of such Awards paid out to a Participant. 
Awards to Outside Directors 
Outside Directors are eligible to be granted Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. However, in any Fiscal Year, no Outside Director may receive Awards (the value of which will be based on their grant date fair value determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) that, in the aggregate, exceed $300,000, provided that such amount is increased to $450,000 in the fiscal year of an Outside Director's initial service as such. Any Awards or other compensation provided to an Outside Director for his or her services as a consultant or employee are excluded from these limitations. 
Change in Control 
If a successor corporation or other entity does not assume or substitute for an Award upon such change in control to the successor, then (i) each Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, and (ii) all restrictions on restricted stock and restricted stock units will lapse. With respect to Awards with performance-based vesting that are not assumed or substituted for, unless the applicable Award Agreement provides otherwise, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be (a) deemed achieved at target levels (with the payout prorated based on the portion of the performance period that has elapsed as of immediately prior to the closing of the transaction), or (b) based on actual achievement versus the performance goals or vesting criteria, and all other terms and conditions will be deemed met, and in each case as determined by the Committee. In addition, if an option or stock appreciation right is not assumed or substituted for, the administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator, in its sole discretion, and the option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 
For Awards granted to our Outside Directors that are assumed or substituted for in a change in control, upon the termination of an Outside Director's service as a director of our or the successor corporation (other than a voluntary resignation that is not made at the successor's request), then (i) the Outside Director will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, (ii) all restrictions on the Outside Director's restricted stock and restricted stock units will lapse, and (iii) with respect to the Outside Director's Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels (with the payout prorated based on the portion of the performance period that elapsed as of immediately prior to the closing of the transaction) and all other terms and conditions will be deemed met, unless the applicable Award Agreement provides otherwise. 
Except as provided above, upon a change in control, each Award generally will be subject to the terms of the applicable Award Agreement that was provided by the Committee for that Award. 
Transferability 
Awards generally may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, except in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution or as determined by the Committee.
Amendment and Termination 
The Company, by action of the Board or its authorized Committee, may at any time and for any reason amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Omnibus Incentive Plan, or any part thereof. However, the Company will obtain  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
 stockholder approval of any amendment to the Omnibus Incentive Plan to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable laws. Any amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Omnibus Incentive Plan will not impair in any material way the rights or obligations of any Participant under any Award that is outstanding as of the effective date of the Omnibus Incentive Plan amendment, alteration, suspension of termination, without the written consent of the Participant. A termination of the Omnibus Incentive Plan will not affect the Committee's ability to exercise its authority under the Omnibus Incentive Plan with respect to any Awards that are outstanding as of the effective date of the termination. No Award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following discussion is a brief summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences of the Omnibus Incentive Plan for a Participant who is a U.S. tax resident under the provisions of the Code currently in effect. The Code and its regulations are subject to change. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe, among other things, state, local or foreign income and other tax consequences. The specific tax consequences to a Participant will depend upon that Participant's individual circumstances. 
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights 
Under existing law and regulations, the grant of options and stock appreciation rights will not result in income taxable to the employee or director. At the time of the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the Participant will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on the excess of the fair market value, at the time of exercise, of the shares purchased over the option's exercise price. At the time of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the Participant will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on the amount of the cash, or the fair market value of the shares, received by the employee upon exercise. No taxable income is reportable by a Participant when an incentive stock option is exercised (although the exercise may subject the Participant to alternative minimum tax and/or may affect the determination of the Participant's alternative minimum tax). If the Participant exercises an incentive stock option and later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares more than two years after the grant date and more than one year after the exercise date, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain or loss. If the Participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares before the end of the two- or one-year holding periods described above, he or she generally will have ordinary income at the time of the sale equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or the sale price, if less) minus the exercise price of the option. 
Restricted Stock Awards 
A Participant in the Omnibus Incentive Plan who is granted a restricted stock Award will not be taxed upon the acquisition of such shares so long as the interest in such shares is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Code Section 83. Upon lapse or release of the restrictions, the recipient will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on an amount equal to the then current fair market value of the shares. Any such Awards that are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture will be taxed at the time of grant. The basis of Restricted Stock held after lapse or termination of restrictions will be equal to their fair market value on the date of lapse or termination of restrictions, and upon subsequent disposition any further gain or loss will be a long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon the length of time the shares are held. A recipient of a restricted stock Award may elect to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on the full fair market value of the Restricted Stock at the time of grant. If this election is made, the basis of the shares acquired will be equal to the fair market value at the time of grant, no tax will be payable upon the subsequent lapse or release of the restrictions, and any gain or loss upon disposition will be a capital gain or loss.  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
Restricted Stock Units 
A Participant who is granted a restricted stock unit will not be taxed upon the grant of the Award. Upon receipt of payment of cash or shares pursuant to a restricted stock unit, the Participant will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to any cash received and the fair market value of any shares received. 
Performance Awards, Cash-Based Awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards 
A recipient of a performance Award, cash-based Award or other stock-based Award generally will realize ordinary income at the time shares are transferred or cash is paid to the grantee with respect to such Award. 
Tax Effect for the Company 
The Company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an Award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by a Participant and at the time that the Participant recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a nonqualified stock option), except as follows. Under Code Section 162(m), the deductibility of compensation paid to certain individuals is limited to $1,000,000 per person per year. These individuals include our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and certain other executive officers (including, but not necessarily limited to, our next three other most highly compensated named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and certain individuals who were subject to Section 162(m) at Woodward in our 2018 Fiscal Year or a later Fiscal Year). Prior to the enactment of the TCJA we could preserve the deductibility of certain compensation in excess of $1,000,000 if the conditions of Code Section 162(m)'s exception for performance-based compensation were met. The TCJA eliminated the performance-based exception for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Under a special transition rule under the TCJA, compensation received from the exercise of non-qualified stock options that we granted prior to November 2, 2017 is expected to be fully deductible although this tax treatment is not guaranteed. 
Section 409A 
Section 409A of the Code imposes certain requirements on nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, including requirements on an individual's election to defer compensation and requirements on the individual's selection of the timing and form of distribution of the deferred compensation. Section 409A also generally provides that distributions of deferred compensation (as determined thereunder) must be made on or following the occurrence of certain events (such as the individual's separation from service, a predetermined date, or the individual's death). Section 409A imposes restrictions on an individual's ability to change his or her distribution timing or form of distribution after the compensation has been deferred. For certain individuals who are officers, Section 409A requires that certain distributions commence no earlier than six months after such officer's separation from service. Certain Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may be designed to be subject to the requirements of Section 409A in form and in operation. For example, restricted stock units that provide for a settlement date that is substantially later than the vesting date may be subject to Section 409A. If an Award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that Award will recognize ordinary income on the amounts deferred under the Award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is actually or constructively received. Also, if an Award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, Section 409A imposes an additional 20 percent federal penalty tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income, as well as interest on such deferred compensation. 
Awards will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are intended to be either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral thereof, as applicable, will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under  PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (continued) 
 Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. The Omnibus Incentive Plan and each Award Agreement is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A, to the extent applicable, and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. To the extent that an Award or payment, or the settlement or deferral thereof, is subject to Section 409A, we intend that the Award will be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the requirements of Section 409A, such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Section 409A. In no event will the Company or other employer have any obligation under the Omnibus Incentive Plan to reimburse a Participant for any taxes or other costs that may be imposed on the Participant as a result of Section 409A. 
Participation in the Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan 
The number and type of Awards (if any) that a service provider may receive under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is in the discretion of the Committee and, therefore, cannot be determined in advance. Our executive officers and Outside Directors will be eligible to receive future Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, and therefore, our executive officers and Outside Directors have an interest in the approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan by stockholders. For purposes of illustration only, the following table sets forth information with respect to the Awards that were granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan during our 2018 fiscal year to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, to all current executive officers as a group, to all Outside Directors as a group, and to all non-executive officer employees as a group. Additional Awards may be granted to these individuals and groups in the future, as determined in the discretion of the Committee.

  (1)  Awards consist of non-qualified stock options. In all cases, the exercise price of  the option is equal to the closing price of Woodward common stock as quoted on NASDAQ on the grant date of the option. All of the options have a maximum 10-year term but may terminate earlier on account of  termination of employment. Each option tranche vests over a period of four years from the grant date at the rate of 25% per year, generally subject to the recipient's continued status as a Service Provider.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Awards consist of restricted stock units ("RSUs"). These RSUs vest over a period of two years from the grant  date at the rate of 50% per year, generally subject to the grantee's continued status as a Service Provider.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  The WVIP amounts consist of target annual short-term incentive compensation under the WVIP. The payment of any actual WVIP  bonuses are based on levels of achievement of overarching and specific performance metrics previously set by the Committee. The overarching performance metric relates to achievement net earnings and determines the maximum WVIP bonuses that can be  paid to the NEOs. Our NEOs are eligible to receive bonuses under the WVIP of a maximum of 1.0% of net earnings for the Chairman & CEO, 0.4% of net earnings for the CFO, and 0.33% of net earnings for the Presidents of ATS and ICS, and 0.3%  for the GC. The specific performance metrics are intended to guide the Committee's use of negative discretion to arrive at actual WVIP bonus amounts that are less than the maximum available. The specific performance metrics for these WVIP  bonuses relate to the Company's adjusted EPS, the Company's adjusted EBITDA margin, Business Group adjusted OEAB margin and strategic performance measures. If at the end of the performance period, the Committee believes that the  achievement of the specific performance metrics under the WVIP is not reflective of the Company's expected level of performance, the Committee may in its discretion modify the amount of any bonus to be awarded under the WVIP, but not above the  maximum bonuses available based on achievement of the overarching net earnings goal. Please see the Summary Compensation Table above for actual amounts earned under the WVIP and Cash LTI for fiscal year 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  The Cash LTI amounts consist of target cash long-term compensation under the LTI Plan for the three-year period from 2018-2020. The payment of actual Cash LTI amounts, if any, will be based on levels of achievement of two separate goals for earnings previously set by the Committee, specifically relative earnings per share and  return on capital.

Your Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval of the amendments to the Woodward Omnibus Incentive Plan.  STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING 
Stockholders who, in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8, wish to present proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy to be distributed in connection with next year's Annual Meeting must submit their proposals so that they are received by us at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on August 13, 2019. Proposals should be sent to the attention of the Corporate Secretary. More information regarding stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8, including procedural and substantive requirements and reasons why the Company may exclude the proposal from its proxy statement may be found in Rule 14a-8. 
Under our Bylaws, certain procedures are provided that a stockholder must follow to nominate persons for election as directors or to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting of stockholders (other than a proposal brought pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8). These procedures provide that nominations for director and/or an item of business to be introduced at an annual meeting of stockholders must be submitted in writing to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at our principal executive offices by a stockholder of record on both the date of giving notice and the record date for the annual meeting. In general, our Bylaws require that such a notice for nominating a director or introducing an item of business at the 2019 Annual Meeting must be received not earlier than October 2, 2019 and not later than November 1, 2019. However, if the 2019 Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the 2018 Annual Meeting, the notice must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting was made, whichever first occurs, or no less than 90 days or more than 120 days prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice must include the specified information concerning the proposal or nominee. A stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal or nomination is encouraged to seek independent counsel about our Bylaws and SEC requirements. We will not consider any proposal or nomination that does not meet the Bylaws and SEC requirements for submitting a proposal or nomination. 
Notices of intention to nominate a director or present proposals at the 2019 Annual Meeting should be addressed to the Corporate Secretary, Woodward, Inc., 1081 Woodward Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80524. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any nomination or proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
In an effort to reduce printing costs and postage fees, we have adopted a practice approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this practice, stockholders who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of our proxy materials, unless one or more of these stockholders notifies us that he or she wishes to continue receiving individual copies. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. 
If you share an address with another stockholder and received only one set of proxy materials and would like to request a separate copy of these materials or any other proxy materials in the future, please: (1) mail your request to Woodward, Inc., 1081 Woodward Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80524, Attn: Corporate Secretary; (2) send an e-mail to investor.relations@woodward.com; or (3) call our Investor Relations department at 1-815-639-2340. Additional copies of the proxy materials will be sent within 30 days after receipt of your request. Similarly, you may also contact us if you received multiple copies of the proxy materials and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future.  OTHER MATTERS 
Woodward is soliciting this proxy on behalf of its Board and will bear the entire cost of proxy solicitation, including the preparation, assembly, printing, mailing and distribution of the proxy materials. This solicitation is being made by mail, but also may be made personally or by facsimile, telephone, messenger, or via the Internet. The Company has employed Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave., Stamford, CT 06902, to solicit proxies for the Annual Meeting from brokers, bank nominees, other institutional holders, and certain individual stockholders. The Company has agreed to pay $6,500 plus the out-of-pocket expenses of Morrow Sodali LLC, for these services. The Company will also pay the regular charge of brokers and other nominees who hold shares of record for forwarding proxy material to the beneficial owners of such shares. 
We are not aware of any additional matters to be acted upon at the meeting other than those discussed in this statement. If any other matter is presented, proxy holders will vote on the matter in their discretion.

1.3        Purposes. The purposes of the Plan are to (a) attract and retain the best available individuals for positions of substantial responsibility, (b) provide additional incentive to such individuals, and (c) promote the success of the Company's business. The Plan also is designed to encourage stock ownership by Participants, thereby aligning their interests with those of the Company's shareholders and to permit the payment of compensation that qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.

Further, if the stockholders of the Company immediately before such change in ownership continue to retain, immediately after the change in ownership, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to the change in ownership, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company or of the ultimate parent entity of the Company, such event will not be considered a Change in Control under this subsection;

EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
3.2        Lapsed Awards .. If an Option or Stock Appreciation Right expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, then the unexercised Shares subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). If a Full Value Award is forfeited or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to vest, then the forfeited or repurchased Shares subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares covered by the portion of the Award so exercised will cease to be available under the Plan. Shares that have been issued under the Plan pursuant to any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan; provided, however, that if unvested Shares of Full Value Awards are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan is terminated). Shares used to pay the Exercise Price or purchase price of an Award and/or used to satisfy the Tax Obligations related to the Award will cease to be available for future grant or sale under the Plan. To the extent an Award is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. For purposes of clarification, no Shares purchased by the Company with proceeds received from the exercise of an Option will become available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3.1, plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan pursuant to this Section 3.2. 
3.3        Full Value Awards. For purposes of determining the number of Shares available for issuance under Section 3.1 above, each Share granted on or after the Effective Date pursuant to any Full Value Award shall reduce the number of Shares remaining under the Share Authorization by two Shares. If any Shares granted pursuant to such a Full Value Award are forfeited, repurchased by the Company due to a failure to vest, paid out in cash, or returned to the Plan for any other reason provided in Section 3.2, the number of Shares returned to the Share Authorization shall be the same number that was deducted from the Share Authorization on account of the grant of the Full Value Award (or portion thereof). 
3.4        Share Reserve. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. 
SECTION 4. 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN 
4.1        Procedure.
4.1.1        Multiple Administrative Bodies Permitted. Different Committees with respect to different groups of Service Providers may administer the Plan.

4.1.3        Rule 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder will be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.

4.2        Powers of the Administrator. Subject to the other provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator will have the authority, in its discretion:

(k)        to allow a Participant, in compliance with Applicable Laws including, but not limited to, Section 409A, to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the issuance of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award; and 
(l)        to impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued as a result of or under an Award, including without limitation, (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy, (ii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, and (iii) requirements for holding Shares in order to comply with Share ownership policies or guidelines adopted by the Company from time to time;

(n)        to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan. 
4.3        Binding Effect of Administrator's Decisions. The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations with respect to the Plan or Awards will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards, and will be given the maximum possible deference permitted by law. 
SECTION 5. 
LIMITS 
5.1        General Share Limits. Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision, for so long as the Company is a "publicly held corporation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) and the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) are applicable to the Company's Covered Employees, then, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14, the limits specified in this Section 5.1 will apply to any grants of the following types of Awards: 
5.1.1        Fiscal Year Limit on Options and/or SARs. No Participant may be granted, during any Fiscal Year, Options and/or SARs covering more than a total of 600,000 Shares; provided, however, that during the Fiscal Year in which a Participant first becomes an Employee (the "Fiscal Year of Hire"), the Participant may be granted Options and/or SARs covering up to a total of an additional 900,000 Shares. 
5.1.2        Fiscal Year Limit on Full Value Awards. No Participant may be granted, during any Fiscal Year, Full Value Awards covering more than a total of 150,000 Shares; provided, however, that during the Fiscal Year of Hire, the Participant may be granted Full Value Awards covering up to a total of an additional 50,000 Shares. 
5.1.3        Fiscal Year Limit on Cash-Based Awards. The maximum amount that may be paid for all Performance Periods ending during a Fiscal Year with respect to Cash-Based Awards is $10,000,000. As an example for illustration purposes only, if a Participant has two Performance Periods that end during a single Fiscal Year (for example, an annual Performance Period and a multi-year Performance Period), the total combined amount that the Participant may be paid for those two Performance Periods is $10 million. For this purpose, an amount that is paid to a Participant in a Fiscal Year that is after the Fiscal Year in which the applicable Performance Period ended (for example, but not by way of limitation, early in the next Fiscal Year following certification of actual results versus the applicable Performance Goals or because it is deferred under a deferred compensation arrangement) will be considered paid for the Fiscal Year in which the applicable Performance Period ended. To the extent permitted under Section 162(m), subsequent increases in the value of the deferred amount pursuant to the deferred compensation arrangement will not count against the limit in this Section 5.1.3. 
5.1.4        Fiscal Year Limit on Covered Employee Annual Incentive Awards. The total amount that may be awarded or credited in any Fiscal Year with respect to a Covered Employee Annual Incentive Award will be determined in Section 12. 
A-9 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
5.2        Fiscal Year Limit on Outside Director Awards and Other Compensation. No Outside Director may be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Awards (the value of which will be based on their Grant Date fair value determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) which, in the aggregate, exceed $300,000, provided that such amount is increased to $450,000 in the Fiscal Year of his or her initial service as an Outside Director. Any Awards or other compensation provided to an individual for his or her services as an Employee, or for his or her services as a Consultant other than as an Outside Director, will be excluded for purposes of the limitations in this Section 5.2. 
5.3        Minimum Vesting Requirement for Full Value Awards. No Full Value Award, Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be scheduled to vest (based on the vesting schedule contained in the applicable Award Agreement) earlier than the one (1) year anniversary of the Grant Date of such Award, except to the limited extent provided in Section 14.3 (relating to Change in Control) or in the case of the death or Disability of the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (a) Full Value Awards that result in the issuance of an aggregate of up to five percent (5%) of the Share Authorization (as defined in Section 3.1) may be granted to Service Providers without regard to the minimum vesting requirements of the prior sentence, and (b) the Committee shall retain its full discretionary authority under Section 4.2(h) (relating to amendments and modifications to outstanding Awards). 
5.4        Incentive Stock Option Limits.
5.4.1        $100,000 Limitation. Notwithstanding any designation of an Option as an Incentive Stock Option in an Award Agreement, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of any Employer) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the portion of the Options falling within such limit will be Incentive Stock Options and the excess Options will be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. For these purposes, Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. 
5.4.2        Maximum Term. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of any Employer, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from its Grant Date or such shorter term as may be provided by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. 
5.4.3        Exercise Price. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the any Employer, the Exercise Price of the Option will be no less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in immediately preceding sentence, the Exercise Price of the Option will be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date. 
5.4.4        Employee Only Eligibility. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. 
5.5        No Exchange Program Permitted. The Administrator may not implement any Exchange Program.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with an Exercise Price of less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code. 
6.4.2        Form of Consideration. The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of: (a) cash; (b) check; (c) promissory note, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws; (d) other Shares, provided that such Shares have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price for the Shares with respect to which such Option will be exercised and provided that accepting such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company, as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion; (e) consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted (or other) cashless exercise program (whether through a broker or otherwise) implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan; (f) by net exercise; (g) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws; or (h) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. 
6.5        Exercise of Option.
6.5.1        Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Each Option will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. 
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (a) a notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (b) full payment of the Exercise Price for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (including 
A-11 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
 satisfaction of all Tax Obligations with respect thereto). Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her legal spouse. Until such Shares are issued and delivered (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue and deliver (or cause to be issued and delivered) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for any dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued and delivered, except as provided in Section 14. 
Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised. 
6.5.2        Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than as the result of the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination of Participant's status as a Service Provider (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the termination of Participant's status as a Service Provider, but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
6.5.3        Disability of Participant. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of Disability (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following termination of Participant's status as a Service Provider due to Disability, but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
6.5.4        Death of Participant. If a Participant dies while he or she is a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of the Participant's death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary under the Plan, provided such beneficiary has been properly designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator and to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. In the absence of such beneficiary designation (or to the extent not permitted by Applicable Laws), then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following termination of Participant's status as a Service Provider due to death, but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
6.6        No Dividend Equivalents Permitted. No dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to Shares that are subject to unexercised Options, provided that nothing in this Section 6.6 shall preclude the Administrator from exercising its powers and authority under Section 14.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7, Restricted Shares will be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the applicable Period of Restriction or at such other time as the Administrator may determine (including after satisfaction of all Tax Obligations with respect thereto). Subject to vesting limitations in Section 5.3, the Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. 
7.7        Voting Rights. During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Restricted Shares may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise. 
7.8        Dividends and Other Distributions. During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Restricted Shares will be entitled to receive any dividends and/or other distributions paid with respect to such Shares, unless the Administrator provides otherwise. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, such Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Restricted Shares with respect to which they were paid. 
7.9        Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions. For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock Awards as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goal(s). The Performance Goal(s) will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Restricted Stock Awards that are intended to qualify under Section 162(m), the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) (e.g., in determining the Performance Goal(s)).

Each Award of Restricted Stock Units will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the number of Restricted Stock Units, the vesting criteria of the Award, the form of payout of the Award, which, subject to Section 8.5, may be left to the discretion of the Administrator, and such other terms and conditions of the Award as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. 
8.3        Vesting Criteria and Other Terms. The Administrator will set vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Participant. The Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued status as a Service Provider), applicable federal or state securities laws or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 
8.4        Earning Restricted Stock Units. Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will be entitled to receive a payout as determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the vesting limitations in Section 5.3, at any time after the grant of Restricted Stock Units, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any vesting criteria that must be met to receive a payout. 
8.5        Form and Timing of Payment. Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement (including after satisfaction of all Tax Obligations with respect thereto). The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares, or a combination of both. 
8.6        Cancellation. On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company. 
8.7        Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions.

In granting Restricted Stock Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m), the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section  162(m) (e.g., in determining the Performance Goal(s)). 
SECTION 9. 
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS 
9.1        Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights. Subject to the limits of Section 5 and the other terms and conditions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Service Providers in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines. 
9.2        Award Agreement. Each Stock Appreciation Right grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Exercise Price of the Stock Appreciation Right, the term of the Stock 
A-14 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
 Appreciation Right, any conditions to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right, and such other terms and conditions of the Award as the Administrator, in its discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. 
9.3        Exercise Price and Other Terms. The Exercise Price of each Stock Appreciation Right will be determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that such Exercise Price may not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted with an Exercise Price of less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code. 
9.4        Expiration of Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right will expire on the date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 6.3 relating to the maximum term and Section 6.5 relating to exercise also will apply to Stock Appreciation Rights. 
9.5        Payment of Stock Appreciation Right Amount. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right (including satisfaction of all Tax Obligations with respect thereto), a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying: 
(a)        The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price; times 
(b)        The number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. 
At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon any Stock Appreciation Right exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof. No adjustment will be made for any dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares, if applicable, are issued and delivered, except as provided in Section 14. 
9.6        No Dividend Equivalents Permitted. No dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to Shares that are subject to unexercised Stock Appreciation Rights, provided that nothing in this Section 6.6 shall preclude the Administrator from exercising its powers and authority under Section 14. 
SECTION 10. 
PERFORMANCE UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES 
10.1        Grant of Performance Units/Shares. Subject to the limits of Section 5 and the other terms and conditions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Performance Units and/or Performance Shares to Service Providers in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines. 
10.2        Value of Performance Units/Shares. Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the Grant Date. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. 
10.3        Performance Objectives and Other Terms. The Administrator will set performance objectives or other vesting provisions (including, without limitation, continued status as a Service Provider) in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance 
A-15 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
 Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Participant. Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued status as a Service Provider), applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion. 
10.4        Earning of Performance Units/Shares. After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, subject to the vesting limitations under Section 5.3, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share. 
10.5        Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares. Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon as practicable after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period (including after satisfaction of all Tax Obligations with respect thereto). The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof. 
10.6        Cancellation of Performance Units/Shares. On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares will be forfeited to the Company. 
10.7        Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions. For purposes of qualifying grants of Performance Units/Shares as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goal(s). The Performance Goal(s) will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Performance Units/Shares which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m), the Administrator will follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section  162(m) (e.g., in determining the Performance Goal(s)). 
SECTION 11. 
PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 162(M) 
11.1        General. If the Administrator, in its discretion, decides to grant an Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), the provisions of this Section 11 will control over any contrary provision in the Plan; provided, however, that the Administrator in its discretion may grant Awards that are not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) to such Participants that are based on Performance Goal(s) or other specific criteria or goals but that do not satisfy the requirements of this Section. 
11.2        Performance Goals. The granting and/or vesting of Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units and other incentives under the Plan may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business criteria within the meaning of Section 162(m) and may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement ("Performance Goals") including (a) Cash Flow; (b) Earnings; (c) Product and Operational Metrics; (d) Revenue; and (e) Total Shareholder Return. 
A-16 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
Any Performance Goal used may be measured (i) in absolute terms, (ii) in combination with another Performance Goal or Goals (for example, but not by way of limitation, as a ratio or matrix), (iii) in relative terms (including, but not limited to, as compared to results for other periods of time, against other objective metrics, and/or against another company, companies or an index or indices), (iv) with respect to equity, assets or human resources of the Company, (including, for example, on a per-share or per-capita basis), (v) against the performance of the Company as a whole or a specific business unit(s) (including acquired business units), business segment(s) or product(s) of the Company, (vi) on a pre-tax or after-tax basis, and/or (vii) on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) or non-GAAP basis. For example, but not by way of limitation, the Administrator could determine that Restricted Stock Units will be earned for a Performance Period for the achievement of goals for Earnings calculated before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. As another example, the Administrator could determine that Restricted Stock Units will be earned for a Performance Period for the achievement of goals for Earnings divided by the number of Shares that are outstanding (in other words, Earnings per Share). 
Performance Goals may differ from Participant to Participant and from Award to Award. Prior to the Determination Date, the Administrator, in its discretion, will determine whether any significant element(s) or item(s) will be included in or excluded from the calculation of any Performance Goal with respect to any Participants. As determined in the discretion of the Administrator prior to the Determination Date, achievement of Performance Goals for a particular Award may be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as adjusted for certain costs, expenses, gains and losses to provide non-GAAP measures of operating results 
11.3        Procedures. To the extent necessary to comply with the performance-based compensation provisions of Section 162(m), with respect to any Award granted subject to Performance Goal(s), within the first twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period, but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the commencement of any Performance Period (or such other time as may be required or permitted by Section 162(m)), the Administrator will, in writing, (a) designate one or more Participants to whom an Award will be made, (b) select the Performance Goal(s) applicable to the Performance Period, (c) establish the Performance Goal(s), and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period, and (d) specify the relationship between Performance Goal(s) and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Participant for such Performance Period. Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Administrator will certify in writing whether the applicable Performance Goal(s) have been achieved for such Performance Period. In determining the amounts earned by a Participant, the Administrator will have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Administrator may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Period. A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goal(s) for such period are achieved (and all Tax Obligations with respect thereto are satisfied). 
11.4        Additional Limitations. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award that is granted to a Participant and is intended to constitute qualified performance based compensation under Section 162(m) will be subject to any additional limitations set forth in the Code (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and rulings issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m), and the Plan will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.

SECTION 12. 
COVERED EMPLOYEE ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS 
12.1        Establishment of Incentive Pool. The Committee may designate Covered Employees who are eligible to receive a monetary payment with respect to a Fiscal Year based on a percentage of an incentive pool equal to the greater of: (a) three percent (3%) of the Company's Consolidated Operating Earnings for the Fiscal Year, (b) two percent (2%) of the Company's Operating Cash Flow for the Fiscal Year, or (c) five percent (5%) of the Company's Net Income for the Fiscal Year. The Administrator will allocate an incentive pool percentage to each designated Covered Employee for each Fiscal Year. In no event may (i) the incentive pool percentage for any one Covered Employee exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total pool, and (ii) the sum of the incentive pool percentages for all Covered Employees cannot exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the total pool. 
12.2        Determination of Covered Employees' Portions. As soon as possible after the determination of the incentive pool for a Fiscal Year, the Administrator will calculate each Covered Employee's allocated portion of the incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. Each Covered Employee's incentive award then will be determined by the Administrator based on the Covered Employee's allocated portion of the incentive pool subject to adjustment in the sole discretion of the Administrator. In no event may the portion of the incentive pool allocated to a Covered Employee be increased in any way, including as a result of the reduction of any other Covered Employee's allocated portion. The Administrator will retain the discretion to adjust such Awards downward. 
SECTION 13. 
CASH-BASED AWARDS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS 
13.1        Grant of Cash-Based Awards. Subject to the limits of Section 5 and the other terms and conditions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Cash-Based Awards in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. 
13.2        Grant of Other Stock-Based Awards. Subject to the limits of Section 5 and the other terms and conditions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Other Stock-Based Awards not otherwise described by the terms of the Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted Shares) in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines, provided that such terms and conditions are otherwise consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Such Awards may involve the transfer of actual Shares to Participants, or the payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Shares and may include, without limitation, Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United States. 
13.3        Value of Cash-Based and Other Stock-Based Awards. Each Cash-Based Award will specify a payment amount or payment range (which may be expressed as a percentage of the Participant's base salary, a dollar amount or a result of a formula or other matrix), as determined by the Administrator. Each Other Stock-Based Award will be expressed in terms of Shares or units based on Shares, as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may establish performance or vesting criteria in its discretion. If the Administrator exercises its discretion to establish such criteria, the number and/or value of Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant will depend on the extent to which the criteria are met. 
13.4        Payment of Cash-Based and Other Stock-Based Awards. Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award, will be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, in cash or Shares as the Administrator determines. 
A-18 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
13.5        Termination. The Administrator will determine the extent to which the Participant will have the right to receive Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards following termination of the Participant's status as a Service Provider. Such provisions will be determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator, may be included in an agreement entered into with each Participant, but need not be uniform among all Awards of Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination. 
SECTION 14. 
ADJUSTMENTS; DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION; MERGER OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
14.1        Adjustments. In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, reincorporation, reclassification, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, will adjust the number and class of shares of stock that may be issued under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of shares of stock covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits in Sections 3 and 5. 
14.2        Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant holding an outstanding Award as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 
14.3        Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control: 
(a)        Each then-outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines (subject to the provisions of the following paragraph) without a Participant's consent, including, without limitation, that (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant's Awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the Change in Control; (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable, or payable, or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part upon the Change in Control, and, to the extent the Administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the Change in Control; (iv) (A) an Award will terminate in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights as of the date of the Change in Control (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the Change in Control the Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company, without payment), or (B) an Award will be replaced with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing. In taking any of the actions permitted under this Section 14.3, the Administrator will not be obligated to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant or other holder, or all Awards of the same type, similarly. 
(b)        If the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for an outstanding Award or portion thereof, as described in subsection (a)(i), and, for the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the minimum vesting requirement set forth in Section 5.3, (i) the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise any such outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right, including Shares as to which such Award would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, (ii) all time-based vesting restrictions on any such Award will 
A-19 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
 lapse, and (iii) the payout level attainable under any such Award with performance-based vesting restrictions will be deemed to have been earned as of the date of the Change in Control based on either (A) the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance criteria against the applicable "target" level(s) measured as of the date of the Change in Control, or (B) the deemed achievement of all relevant performance criteria against the applicable "target" level(s) measured as of the date of the Change in Control, with a pro rata payout based on the number of days within the applicable Performance Period that has elapsed before the Change in Control, as determined by the Administrator, and, in each such case, all other applicable vesting criteria and other terms and conditions of the Award will be deemed to have been satisfied, unless specifically provided otherwise in the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or other Employer. The treatment of any other Awards will be determined by the Administrator in connection with the grant thereof, as reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that such Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 
For the purposes of this Section 14.3, an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, Performance Share or Other Stock-Based Award, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 14.3 to the contrary, and unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, an Award that vests, is earned or paid out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals or other performance criteria will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such goals or criteria without the Participant's consent; provided, however, that a modification to such goals or criteria only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if a payment under an Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A and if the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement does not comply with the definition of "change in control event" for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A, then any payment of an amount that otherwise is accelerated under this Section will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Section 409A without triggering any penalties applicable under Section 409A. 
14.4        Outside Director Awards. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for in the event of a Change in Control, if on the date of or following such assumption or substitution, the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant (unless such resignation is at the request of the acquirer), then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights as to all of the Shares underlying such Award, including those Shares which would not 
A-20 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
 otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock-Based Awards will lapse, and, with respect to Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable Award Agreement or other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or other Employer. 
SECTION 15. 
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF AWARDS 
15.1        Legal Compliance Required. In no event will Shares be issued or delivered pursuant to the exercise or settlement of an Award unless such exercise or settlement and the issuance and delivery of such Shares complies or will comply with Applicable Laws, as determined by the Administrator, with such determination subject to the further approval of counsel for the Company. 
15.2        Section 409A. Awards will be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral thereof, as applicable, will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Section 409A, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. The Plan and each Award Agreement is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A, to the extent applicable, and will be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent, except as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator. To the extent that an Award or payment, or the settlement or deferral thereof, is subject to Section 409A, the Award will be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the requirements of Section 409A, such that the grant, payment, settlement or deferral will not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Section 409A. In no event will the Company or other Employer have any obligation under the Plan to reimburse a Participant for any taxes or other costs that may be imposed on the Participant as a result of Section 409A. 
15.3        Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required. 
15.4        Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction or to complete or comply with the requirements of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state, federal or foreign law or under the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock exchange on which Shares of the same class are then listed, or any other governmental or regulatory body, which authority, registration, qualification or rule compliance is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary or advisable for the issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority, registration, qualification or rule compliance will not have been obtained. 
15.5        Forfeiture Events. The Administrator may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to the reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of the Award. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, an Award will be subject to the Company's clawback policy or other compensation recoupment policy as may be established and/or amended from time to time (the "Clawback Policy"). The Administrator may require a Participant to forfeit, return or reimburse the Company all or a portion of the Award and any amounts paid thereunder pursuant to the terms of the Clawback Policy or as necessary or appropriate to comply with Applicable Laws. 
A-21 
EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
15.6        Leaves of Absence or Transfers Between Locations. Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, the vesting of an Award will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee or Director in the case of (a) any leave of absence approved by the Employer or (b) transfers between locations of the Company, between the Company and another Employer or between an Employer and another Employer. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no leave of absence may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Employer is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months following the first (1st) day of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonqualified Stock Option. 
15.7        Limited Transferability of Awards. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, the related Award Agreement will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriates. 
15.8        Dividends on Unvested Full Value Awards. Any dividends or distributions (as determined by the Administrator) that are paid on Shares underlying an unvested Full Value Award will not be immediately paid to the Participant and instead will accrue and be subject to the same vesting schedule, forfeiture provisions, and payout timing as then applicable to the Full Value Award on which such dividends or other distributions accrued. 
15.9        Indemnification. Subject to the requirements of Delaware law, each individual who is or has been a member of the Board and/or any Committee, or who is an Employee to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 3 (an "Indemnitee"), will be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (a) any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which the Indemnitee may be a party or in which the Indemnitee may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan or any Award Agreement, and (b) any and all amounts paid by the Indemnitee in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by the Indemnitee in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, or proceeding against the Indemnitee, provided the Indemnitee gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before the Indemnitee undertakes to handle and defend it on the Indemnitee's own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of the Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute. The foregoing right of indemnification, if any, will not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which the Indemnitee may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or under any power that the Company may have to indemnify or hold harmless the Indemnitee. 
15.10        No Effect on Employment or Service. Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Employer, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the right of the Employer to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by law. 
15.11        Participation. No Service Provider will have the right to be selected to receive an Award or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive any future Award.

SECTION 16. 
TAX WITHOLDING 
16.1        General Requirements. Prior to the issuance of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof) or such earlier time as any Tax Obligations with respect to the Award are due, the Company and/or other Employer, as applicable, will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company or other Employer, as applicable, an amount sufficient to satisfy all Tax Obligations with respect to the Award (or exercise thereof). 
16.2        Withholding or Remittance Arrangements. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may require or permit a Participant to satisfy such Tax Obligations, in whole or in part, by (without limitation): (a) paying cash, check or other cash equivalents, (b) electing to have the Company (or other Employer, as applicable) withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory amount required to be withheld or remitted, or such greater amount as the Administrator may determine if such amount will not cause adverse accounting consequences, as the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion (the "Applicable Withholding Amount"), (c) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the Applicable Withholding Amount, provided that the delivery of such Shares will not result in any adverse accounting consequences, as the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, (d) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld or remitted, (e) any other means that the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines to both comply with Applicable Laws and to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan, or (f) any combination of the foregoing arrangements. Unless otherwise specifically determined by the Administrator, the withholding arrangements approved by the Administrator under this Section 16.2 shall be intended to avoid the applicable Award being subject to liability accounting under ASC 718. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the Tax Obligations are required to be withheld or remitted. 
SECTION 17. 
AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND DURATION OF PLAN 
17.1        Amendment, Suspension or Termination Authority. Except as otherwise specified in this Section, the Company, by action of the Board (or its authorized delegate), may at any time and for any reason amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof. The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws. Any amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will not impair in any material way the rights or obligations of any Participant under any Award that is outstanding as of the effective date of the Plan amendment, alteration, suspension of termination, without the written consent of the Participant. However, a termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise its authority under the Plan with respect to any Awards that are outstanding as of the effective date of the termination. No Award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan. 
17.2        Duration of Plan. The Plan is effective as of the Effective Date, and subject to Section 17, will remain in effect thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without further stockholder approval, no Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after September 13, 2026.

EXHIBIT A – WOODWARD OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
SECTION 18. 
LEGAL CONSTRUCTION 
18.1        Governing Law. The Plan and each Award Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might other otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant is deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Delaware, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to the Plan or the Award Agreement. 
18.2        Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan is held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
18.3        Captions. Captions in the Plan are provided for convenience only, and will not serve as a basis for the interpretation or construction of the Plan.
