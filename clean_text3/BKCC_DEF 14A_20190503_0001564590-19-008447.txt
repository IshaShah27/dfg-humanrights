PROXY STATEMENT
FOR
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON MAY 3, 2019 
This document will give you the information you need to vote on the matters listed on the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice of Annual Meeting"). Much of the information in this proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement") is required under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"); some of it is technical. If there is anything you do not understand, please contact us at 212-810-5800. 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board," each member of which is referred to as a "Director") of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (the "Company," "we," "our" or "us"), of proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting (the "Annual Meeting") of owners of shares of common stock (the "Stockholders") of the Company and, if the Annual Meeting is adjourned, postponed or delayed, at any later meetings, for the purposes stated in the Notice of Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held on the 4th floor of 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York, on May 3, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time). This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting and the enclosed proxy card are first being sent to Stockholders on or about March 20, 2019. 
WHY IS A STOCKHOLDER MEETING BEING HELD? 
To address various proposals that require Stockholder approval. 
WHAT PROPOSALS WILL BE VOTED ON? 
In the first proposal (the "First Proposal" or "Proposal 1"), Stockholders are being asked to elect the Class III Directors to the Board of the Company. 
In the second proposal (the "Second Proposal" or "Proposal 2"), Stockholders are being asked to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
WILL MY VOTE MAKE A DIFFERENCE? 
YES! Your vote is important to the governance of the Company, no matter how many shares you own. 
WHO IS ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE? 
The enclosed proxy is solicited by the Board for use at the Annual Meeting to be held on May 3, 2019, and, if the Annual Meeting is adjourned, postponed or delayed, at any later meetings, for the purposes stated in the Notice of Annual Meeting (see previous page). 
HOW DOES THE COMPANY'S BOARD RECOMMEND THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE ON THE PROPOSALS?
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" each Proposal. 
WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE? 
Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2019 are entitled to be present and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments, postponements or delays thereof. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. Shares represented by duly executed proxies will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you sign the proxy, but do not fill in a vote, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. If any other business is brought before the Annual Meeting, your shares will be voted by the proxyholders at their discretion according to the Board's recommendation.  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD AND A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES? 
Stockholders of record own shares that are registered directly in their name with the Company's transfer agent, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. The Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and proxy card are being sent directly to Stockholders of record by the Company. Stockholders of record have the right to vote in person at the Annual Meeting or to grant a voting proxy directly to anyone to vote in their place. 
Beneficial owners of shares own shares that are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee. The Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and proxy card are being forwarded to beneficial owners by their respective broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, the Stockholder of record. A beneficial owner has the right to direct its broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote and is also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. A beneficial owner may vote shares by voting in accordance with the Notice of Annual Meeting, by returning a proxy card to the Company or by making an arrangement with its broker, bank or other nominee concerning how such broker, bank or other nominee should vote its shares. A beneficial owner may also vote its shares in person at the Annual Meeting, if the beneficial owner brings a brokerage statement reflecting its stock ownership as of March 5, 2019, the record date. 
HOW DO I VOTE BY PROXY? 
Stockholders of record may authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf by mail, as described on the enclosed proxy card. Authorizing a proxy will not limit a Stockholder's right to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. A properly completed and submitted proxy timely received by the Company before the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the Stockholder's instructions, unless those instructions are subsequently revoked. If the Stockholder authorizes a proxy without indicating voting instructions, the proxyholders will vote the Stockholder's shares at their discretion according to the Board's recommendations. Stockholders of record may also vote either via the Internet or by telephone. The enclosed proxy card includes specific instructions to be followed by Stockholders of record interested in voting via the Internet or by telephone. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate a Stockholder's identity and to allow Stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Stockholders that vote via the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which will be borne by the Stockholder. 
HOW DO I VOTE IF MY SHARES ARE HELD THROUGH A BROKER?
Stockholders who hold shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee must follow the voting instructions provided by the broker, bank or nominee, whichever is the record holder. If a Stockholder holds shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and the Stockholder wishes to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, the Stockholder must obtain a legal proxy from the record holder of the Stockholder's shares and present the proxy at the Annual Meeting. If the Stockholder does not vote in person at the Annual Meeting or does not submit voting instructions to its broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to vote the Stockholder's shares on non-routine proposals. The First Proposal is considered a non-routine proposal. For non-routine proposals, a broker, bank or other nominee that holds shares in street name on behalf of a Stockholder must receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares in order for the shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes represent those shares held in street name for which the beneficial Stockholder has not provided voting instructions. Since the Second Proposal is a routine proposal, there may be broker non-votes at the Annual Meeting. With respect to the First Proposal, Mark S. Lies, Maureen K. Usifer, and James E. Keenan would be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of all shares of common stock of the Company present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. When there are three director nominees up for election, as is the case here, a vote by plurality means the three director nominees with the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected, regardless of the votes withheld for the candidates. Therefore, with respect to the First Proposal, withheld votes and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted towards a nominee's achievement of a plurality. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee cannot vote its shares for the First Proposal. If the beneficial owner authorizes a proxy or properly executes any materials prepared by the broker, bank or other nominee without indicating voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee will vote its shares according to the Board's recommendations.  CAN I REVOKE MY PROXY OR CHANGE MY VOTE? 
The Stockholder of record can revoke a proxy at any time before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting by (1) delivering a written revocation notice prior to the Annual Meeting to BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022; (2) submitting a later-dated proxy card, a later-dated electronic vote via the website stated on the proxy card, or a later-dated vote using the toll-free telephone number stated on the proxy card; or (3) voting in person at the Annual Meeting. If the Stockholder holds shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee, the Stockholder must follow the instructions received from the broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke the voting instructions. Attending the Annual Meeting does not revoke a proxy unless the Stockholder also votes in person at the Annual Meeting. 
WHO IS PAYING FOR THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES? 
The Company will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and posting to the Internet the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished to Stockholders. The Company intends to use the services of Georgeson Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies. The Company expects to pay market rates for such services, with an estimated fee not to exceed $6,500 plus expenses. 
Proxies may also be solicited in person and/or by telephone, mail, facsimile transmission or email by the Directors or our officers and/or the officers or employees of BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, the Company's investment advisor (the "Advisor"), or its affiliates. No additional compensation will be paid to the Directors, officers or regular employees for such services. 
WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH OF THE PROPOSALS? 
First Proposal. The affirmative vote of a plurality of all shares of common stock of the Company present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to elect each of the nominees as a director. A vote by a plurality means the three nominees with the highest number of affirmative votes, regardless of the votes withheld for the candidates, will be elected. 
Second Proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of all shares of common stock of the Company present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote, is required to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Because brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, there should not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Second Proposal. 
HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED? 
First Proposal. Stockholders may vote "For" or "Withhold." A vote for "Withhold" with respect to a nominee for director will be treated as present for purposes of determining a quorum for the Annual Meeting but will not be counted towards a nominee's achievement of a plurality. Where there are three director nominees up for election, as is the case here, a vote by a plurality means the three nominees with the highest number of affirmative votes, regardless of the votes withheld for the candidates, will be elected. As a result, a "Withhold" vote will have no effect on the First Proposal. If a Stockholder holds shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, the Stockholder's broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to the First Proposal. Therefore, if a Stockholder holds shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and the Stockholder does not give its broker, bank or other nominee specific instructions on how to vote and sufficient shares are present at the Annual Meeting for quorum purposes, or the Stockholder does not vote in accordance with the voting instructions on the proxy card, the Stockholder's shares will be treated as present for purposes of establishing quorum, but will not be counted towards a nominee's achievement of a plurality. However, if a Stockholder authorizes a proxy or properly executes any materials prepared by broker, bank or other nominee without indicating voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee will have the discretion to vote the Stockholder's shares according to the Board's recommendations.  Second Proposal. Stockholders may vote "For," "Against," or "Abstain." A vote for "Abstain" with respect to the Second Proposal will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum and will have the effect of a vote against the Second Proposal. Because brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, there should not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Second Proposal. If a Stockholder holds shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, the Stockholder's broker, bank or nominee will be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to the Second Proposal. 
If a Stockholder holds shares in its own name (i.e., not through a bank, broker or nominee) and signs and returns a proxy card with no further instructions, the Stockholder's shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board with respect to the First and Second Proposals. The proxyholders will vote in accordance with their discretion with regard to any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting. 
If there appears not to be enough votes to approve any of the Proposals at the Annual Meeting, the Chair of the Annual Meeting or a majority of the Stockholders who are represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting may vote to adjourn the Annual Meeting to permit the further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote proxies held by them for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against the proposal for which an adjournment is sought, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
HOW MANY SHARES OF THE COMPANY WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF THE RECORD DATE? 
The Company had 68,836,255 shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. 
WHAT IS A QUORUM FOR PURPOSES OF THE PROPOSALS BEING VOTED ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and present in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum for the Proposals; provided, however, that if there is no contest for the election of Directors, and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are not present in person or by proxy, the holders of one-third of such shares shall constitute a quorum to the extent permitted by applicable law. In the event there are not sufficient votes for a quorum or to approve the Proposals at the time of the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned, postponed or delayed in order to permit further solicitation of proxies by the Company. 
THE PROPOSALS
FIRST PROPOSAL: TO ELECT THE CLASS III DIRECTORS.
WHO ARE THE NOMINEES FOR CLASS III DIRECTORS?
Mark S. Lies, Maureen K. Usifer and James E. Keenan have been re-nominated for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. Certain information concerning Mr. Lies, Ms. Usifer and Mr. Keenan is set forth below. Mr. Lies has been a Director of the Company since 2016, Ms. Usifer has been a Director of the Company since 2005 and Mr. Keenan has been a Director of the Company since 2017.
The Board currently consists of seven (7) Directors and is divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The term of office of one class of Directors expires at each annual meeting of Stockholders on a staggered basis. Each class of Directors holds office for a three-year term. For example, Meridee A. Moore and William E. Mayer stood for re-election as Class II Directors at last year's annual meeting of Stockholders; the Class I Directors, John R. Baron and Jerrold B. Harris are expected to stand for re-election at the Company's 2020 annual meeting of Stockholders; and the Class III Directors, Mark S. Lies, Maureen K. Usifer and James E. Keenan, stand for re-election at this year's annual meeting of Stockholders and if re-elected will serve as Class III Directors. Each Director holds office for the three-year term to which he or she is elected and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. The NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") rules require listed companies, such as the Company, to have a board of directors composed of at least a majority of independent directors. Independent directors are those who are not interested persons of the Company or of the Advisor, for purposes of the 1940 Act (the "Independent Directors"). Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act defines an "interested person" to include, among other things, any person who has, or within the last two years had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company. As part of its annual assessment of director independence as required under NASDAQ rules, our Board has determined that each of the following Directors are independent: Messrs. Baron, Harris, Lies and Mayer, Ms. Usifer and Ms. Moore. Based upon information requested from each Director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board has affirmatively determined that none of the Independent Directors has a material business or professional relationship with the Company, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Board or any Board committee. 
Mr. Lies and Ms. Usifer are nominees for Independent Directors. Mr. Keenan is our Interim Chief Executive Officer and, if elected, will be an Interested Director:

Yes. The Board has determined that the efficient conduct of the Company's affairs makes it desirable to delegate responsibility for certain specific matters to committees of the Board. The committees meet as often as necessary, either in conjunction with regular meetings of the Board or otherwise. The Board has created a Governance and Compensation Committee comprised of all of the Independent Directors. The Board has also created an Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") comprised solely of Independent Directors. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at http://www.blackrockbkcc.com. The charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. The primary function of the Audit Committee is to serve as an independent and objective party to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for overseeing all material aspects of the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes, internal control and audit functions, monitoring the independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, providing a means for open communication among the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, financial and senior management and the Board, reviewing and commenting on preliminary valuation conclusions by independent valuations firms and overseeing compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is presently composed of six persons, including Mses. Usifer (Chair) and Moore and Messrs. Baron, Lies, Harris, and Mayer, each of whom is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act and The NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance regulations. The Board has determined that Ms. Usifer is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined under Item 407 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. Ms. Usifer meets the current independence and experience requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and, in addition, is not an "interested person" of the Company or of the Advisor as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.

Such recommendation must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed candidate to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. The Governance and Compensation Committee may take into consideration the number of shares of the Company's common stock held by the recommending Stockholder and the length of time that such shares have been held. The Governance and Compensation Committee seeks to identify individuals to serve on the Board who have a diverse range of viewpoints, qualifications, experiences, backgrounds and skill sets so that the Board will be better suited to fulfill its responsibility of overseeing the Company's activities. In so doing, the Governance and Compensation Committee reviews the size of the Board and the knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity of the Directors in light of the issues facing the Company in determining whether one or more new directors should be added to the Board. The Governance and Compensation Committee believes that the Directors as a group possess the array of skills, experiences and backgrounds necessary to guide the Company. The Director biographies included herein highlight the diversity and breadth of skills, qualifications and expertise that the Directors bring to the Company. 
Stockholder recommendations for nominees must set forth the information required by the Company's bylaws, which includes the information described above and must be delivered to or mailed and received at the Company's principal executive office not more than 120 days nor fewer than 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of Stockholders; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting has changed by more than 30 days from the prior year, the nomination must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth  day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the meeting was made, whichever first occurs.

WHAT QUALIFICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES? 
The charter of the Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board provides for evaluating potential director candidates against the knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity that in the Company's view are necessary and desirable for such candidates. The knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity of a director candidate are considered in their totality, and none of the criteria, in isolation, is controlling. The Company believes that the criteria set forth in the Governance and Compensation Committee charter allow for directors who have balanced and diverse experience, skills, attributes and qualifications, which in turn allows the Board to operate effectively in governing the Company and protecting the interests of its Stockholders. Each director's background and experience evince the ability to perform his or her duties as a director effectively. In particular, these experiences include the director's education or professional training; business, consulting, public service or academic positions; experience from service as a board member of the Company, other investment companies, public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations; ongoing commitment and participation in Board and committee meetings, as well as leadership of standing committees throughout the years; or other relevant life experiences.

[END TABLE]
 IS THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD AN INTERESTED DIRECTOR? 
Yes. Our Directors have been divided into interested Directors and Independent Directors. Interested Directors are interested persons as defined in the 1940 Act. The Board's Chair, James Keenan, is an interested Director because he is a Managing Director of BlackRock, Chief Investment Officer and Global Co-Head of Fundamental Credit as well as a member of BlackRock's Global Operating Committee and the BlackRock Alternative Investment Executive Committee. In part because the Company is an externally-managed investment company, the Board believes having an interested chair that is familiar with the Company's portfolio companies, its day-to-day management and the operations of its Advisor enhances, among other things, the Board's understanding of the Company's investment portfolio, business, finances and risk management efforts. In addition, the Board believes that Mr. Keenan's employment with an affiliate of the Advisor better allows for the efficient mobilization of the Advisor's resources at the Board's behest and on its behalf.
IS THERE A LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR? 
On March 7, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the appointment of William E. Mayer to the newly created role of Lead Independent Director. Mr. Mayer has been a Director of the Company since 2005. The Board of Directors believes that the addition of this position will allow each director to enjoy more effective, accurate and efficient communication with the Company, the Advisor and management, and will facilitate the timely transmission of information among such parties.
WHAT IS THE BOARD'S ROLE WITH RESPECT TO OVERSIGHT OF THE COMPANY'S RISKS? 
As is the case with most business development companies and investment companies, the Company's investment adviser has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Company, which includes responsibility for risk management. Examples of prominent risks include investment risk, regulatory and compliance risks, operational risks, accounting risks, valuation risks, service provider risks and legal risks. As part of its oversight role, the Board, acting at its scheduled meetings, or the Board's Chair, acting between Board meetings, interacts with and receives reports from senior personnel of service providers, including the Advisor's portfolio management personnel. The Board receives periodic presentations and reports from senior personnel of the Advisor regarding risk management generally, as well as periodic presentations regarding specific operational, compliance or investment areas such as accounting, administration, anti-money laundering, business continuity, personal trading, valuation, and investment research. The Board also receives reports from counsel to the Company and the Board's own independent legal counsel regarding regulatory compliance and governance matters. The Board's Audit Committee receives periodic communications from the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Board interacts with and receives reports from the Company's Chief Compliance Officer in connection with each scheduled meeting and, at least on an annual basis, the Company's Independent Directors meet separately from the Advisor and the Company's management, with the Company's Chief Compliance Officer and independent legal counsel on regulatory compliance matters. The Board's oversight role does not make the Board a guarantor of the Company's investments or activities. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by the Advisor and the other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Company. 
HOW CAN THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS SEND COMMUNICATIONS TO THE DIRECTORS? 
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board or any member of the Board by mail addressed to the Board or the Director(s) with whom they wish to communicate by either name or title. All such correspondence should be sent c/o Secretary of the Company at 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022. 
HOW OFTEN DO THE DIRECTORS MEET? 
In 2018, the number of meetings held for the full Board totaled five and the number of meetings held for the Audit Committee totaled four. The Governance and Compensation Committee met twice in 2018. During the Company's last full fiscal year, each Director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) all regular meetings of the Board of the Company and (ii) all meetings of all committees of the Board of the Company on which the Director served. The Company requires each Director to make a diligent effort to attend all Board and committee meetings, and encourages,  but does not require, Directors to attend the annual meeting of Stockholders. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, one of the Directors attended in person. 
WHAT ARE THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS PAID FOR THEIR SERVICES? 
NASDAQ rules require listed companies, such as the Company, to approve the compensation of the chief executive officer. The Company has not paid, and does not intend to pay, compensation to our executive officers for their service as executive officers of the Company. Our executive officers are employees of, and are compensated by, the Advisor and/or the Company's administrator. The Independent Directors have approved the investment management agreement between the Company and the Advisor and the administration agreement between the Company and its administrator, each as required under the 1940 Act. 
The following table shows information regarding the compensation received by the Independent Directors and officers from the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. No compensation is paid to directors who are "interested persons" as defined in the 1940 Act.

D&T was selected by the Audit Committee of the Company and that selection was ratified by the Company's Board, including all of the Independent Directors, by a vote cast in person. The Company does not know of any direct or indirect financial interest of D&T in the Company. A representative of D&T will attend the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to answer questions. Fees Incurred by the Company for Deloitte & Touche LLP 
Aggregate fees incurred by the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the Company's principal accounting firm, D&T, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and their respective affiliates, are set forth below.

       2018        2017    
 Audit Fees     $  684,500        $  700,000    
 Audit-Related Fees        100,000           106,000

 Total     $  899,500        $  897,000    
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees 
Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end consolidated financial statements and reviews of the condensed consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as work generally only the independent registered public accounting firm can be reasonably expected to provide, such as comfort letters, consents and review of documents filed with the SEC, including certain 8-K filings. Audit fees also include fees for the audit opinion rendered regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
Audit-Related Fees 
Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. 
Tax Services Fees 
Tax services fees consist of fees billed for professional services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm's tax personnel for tax compliance. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and local tax compliance except those services specifically related to the audit and review of financial statements. 
All Other Fees 
Other fees would include fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm for products and services other than the services reported above. 
Audit Committee Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. D&T, as our independent registered public accounting firm ("Independent Auditors"), is responsible for performing an independent audit of our financial statements in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. The Audit Committee is also directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of our Independent Auditors. 
The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services that may be provided by our Independent Auditors. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the Independent Auditors in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the Independent Auditors' independence. The responsibility for pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services includes pre-approval of the fees for such services and the other terms of the engagement.  Periodically, the Audit Committee reviews and approves all audit, audit-related, tax and all other services that are performed by our Independent Auditors. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority between meetings to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the Independent Auditors to management. 
All services described above under "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Services Fees" and "All Other Fees" were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's previous filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act that might incorporate future filings, including this Proxy Statement, in whole or in part, the following Report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any such filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited financial statements and met and held discussions with management and with D&T, with and without management present, regarding the audited financial statements. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Committee has discussed with D&T matters required to be discussed relating to D&T's judgments about the quality, as well as the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles as applied in its financial reporting as required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standards No. 1301 ("AS 1301"). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with D&T their independence from management and the Company, as well as the matters in the written disclosures received from D&T and required by AS 1301 and PCAOB Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence." The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from D&T required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding D&T's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with D&T its independence. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions referred to above, including its discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements, the representations of management and the report of the D&T to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board include the audited financial statements in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee has also recommended and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, has approved, selecting D&T to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Required Vote 
Approval of the Second Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all shares of common stock of the Company present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote. Abstentions will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum and will have the effect of a vote against the Second Proposal. Because brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, there should not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Second Proposal.  THE BOARD, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL. 
* * * * *
FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND THE ANNUAL MEETING 
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition, certain officers, Directors and employees of each of the Company and the Advisor (none of whom will receive additional compensation therefor) may solicit proxies in person and/or by telephone, mail, facsimile transmission or email. 
The Company intends to use the services of Georgeson Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies and expects to pay market rates for such services, with an estimated fee not to exceed $6,500 plus expenses. As the Annual Meeting approaches, certain Stockholders may receive a telephone call from a representative of Georgeson Inc. if the Stockholder's votes have not yet been received. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as shares present at the Annual Meeting but not as votes cast and will not affect the result of the votes on Proposal 1. Because brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, there should not be any broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 2. 
All properly executed proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked thereon or otherwise as provided therein.

[END TABLE]
We have entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor, under which the Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of our Board, manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory services to us. For providing these services, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a management fee based on our total assets and an incentive fee based on our investment performance, plus reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the Advisor. Our executive officers and Directors and the employees of the Advisor and certain of its affiliates, as well as members of the investment committee, serve or may serve as investment advisors, officers, directors or principals of entities or  investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do and/or investment funds managed by our affiliates. We note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Advisor or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Advisor and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by advisors affiliated with the Advisor. However, the Advisor and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures. In any such case, if the Advisor forms other affiliates in the future, we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. 
Pursuant to the terms of the administration agreement, BlackRock, through the Administrator (a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock), provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. 
From time to time, we may invest in transactions in which our Directors and officers or the officers and employees of the Advisor and/or certain of its affiliates have a pecuniary interest. With respect to any such investment, we intend to comply with the relevant provisions of the 1940 Act to the extent they apply to us as a business development company, any other applicable laws, the conditions of an exemptive order we received from the SEC that permits us to enter into joint transactions with certain affiliates of the Company and our written policies and procedures concerning affiliated transactions. Depending on the extent of the individual's pecuniary interest, the Advisor will disclose the interest to its investment committee, our senior management and our Board and may, among other actions, seek the Board's approval to enter into the transaction and require the individual to recuse himself or herself from the deliberations and voting of our Board, the Advisor and its investment committee with respect to the transaction. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 
WE WILL FURNISH, WITHOUT CHARGE, A COPY OF OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT AND THE MOST RECENT QUARTERLY REPORT SUCCEEDING THE ANNUAL REPORT, IF ANY, TO ANY STOCKHOLDER UPON REQUEST. REQUESTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE COMPANY AT 40 EAST 52ND STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10022 (TELEPHONE NUMBER 212-810-5800) OR GEORGESON INC., THE COMPANY'S PROXY SOLICITOR (TELEPHONE NUMBER 1-800-866-316-3922). 
We periodically update performance and certain other data for Company in the "Investor Relations" section of our website which can be found at http://www.blackrockbkcc.com. Investors and others are advised to periodically check the website for updated performance information and the release of other material information about the Company. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company's Directors and executive officers, and any persons holding 10% or more of its common stock, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by such persons, the Company believes that each of its officers and directors and any persons holding 10% or more of its common stock complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN 
On March 6, 2018, the Company amended its dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the amended Plan, if the Company declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gain or other distribution, the reinvestment plan agent will acquire shares for the participants' accounts, depending upon the following circumstances, (i) through receipt of unissued but authorized shares from the Company ("newly issued shares") and/or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares on the open market or on the Company's primary exchange ("open-market purchases"). If, on the last quarterly dividend payment date, the net asset value per share ("NAV") is equal to or less than the closing market price  per share on such dividend payment date (such condition often referred to as a "market premium"), the reinvestment plan agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares acquired on behalf of the participants. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the greater of (i) the NAV or (ii) 95% of the closing market price on such dividend payment date. If, on the dividend payment date, the NAV is greater than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage commissions (such condition often referred to as a "market discount"), the reinvestment plan agent may, upon notice to the reinvestment plan agent from the Company, either (a) invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants or (b) invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the participants in open-market purchases. In the event that the Company elects to have the reinvestment plan agent invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants, the number of newly issued shares to be credited to each participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the market price on the dividend payment date. In the event that the Company elects to have the reinvestment plan agent invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the participants in open-market purchases, the number of shares issued to each participant will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the weighted average price per share (including any applicable brokerage commissions) for all shares purchased by the reinvestment plan agent in the open market in connection with the dividend. The reinvestment plan agent will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares trade on an "ex-distribution" basis or 30 days after the distribution payment date, whichever is sooner (the "last purchase date"), to invest the distribution amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. If the reinvestment plan agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases on the last purchase date, the reinvestment plan agent shall invest any uninvested portion in newly issued shares at the closing market price per share on the last purchase date. If the market discount shifts to a market premium based on the closing market price per share at any day during the purchase period, the reinvestment plan agent shall cease making open-market purchases after such day and invest any un-invested portion in newly issued shares. Investments in newly issued shares made in this manner would be made pursuant to the process described under the market premium condition with the date of such shift from market discount to market premium substituting for the dividend payment date. In either of the above scenarios where a combination of open-market purchases and newly issued shares is used to fulfil the Plan's requirements, the number of shares issued to each participant will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the weighted average of the two methods including any applicable brokerage commissions. On March 7, 2018, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC concerning the amended Plan. You may access the Form 8-K filing and the Plan at http://www.sec.gov or http://www.blackrockbkcc.com.
PRIVACY PRINCIPLES OF THE COMPANY 
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of Stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our Stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our Stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our Stockholders or former Stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service Stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator). 
We restrict access to non-public personal information about the Stockholders to employees of the Advisor with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our Stockholders. 
DEADLINE FOR STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Stockholder proposals intended for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement in connection with the Company's 2019 annual meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be received by us at our principal executive offices by Thursday, November 21, 2019. 
Stockholders who do not wish to submit a proposal for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for the 2019 annual meeting in accordance with Rule 14a-8 may submit a proposal for consideration at the 2019 annual meeting in accordance with the Company's bylaws. The Company's bylaws require that advance notice be given to the Company in the event a Stockholder desires to transact any business from the floor at an annual meeting of  Stockholders, including the nomination of Directors. Notice of any such business must be in writing and received at the Company's principal executive office between Friday, January 3, 2020 and Monday, February 3, 2020.
In order to be considered timely, such notice shall be delivered to the Company's Secretary at the principal executive office of the Company and shall set forth all information required under the Company's bylaws. 
Copies of the Company's bylaws are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at www.sec.gov. The Company will also furnish, without charge, a copy of its bylaws to a Stockholder upon request. Such requests should be directed to the Company at 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022, or by calling 212-810-5800. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more Stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement and annual report addressed to those Stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for Stockholders and cost savings for companies. 
A number of brokers with account holders who are the Company's Stockholders will be "householding" the Company's proxy materials. A single Proxy Statement will be delivered to multiple Stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected Stockholders. If you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Proxy Statement and annual report, please notify your broker. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Proxy Statement and annual report at their addresses and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their brokers. 
Please note that only one Proxy Statement and annual report may be delivered to two or more Stockholders who share an address, unless the Company has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and annual report or for instructions as to how to request a separate copy of this document and annual report or as to how to request a single copy if multiple copies of this document and annual report are received, Stockholders should contact the Company at the address and phone number set forth below. 
Requests should be directed to the Company at 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022 (telephone number 212-810-5800). Copies of these documents may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC's home page on the Internet at http://www.sec.gov.
