   Cooper Tire's executive compensation program for its named executive officers is driven by our financial and strategic goals and the principle of pay for performance. The compensation program, which primarily consists of a base salary and performance-based cash incentive and equity awards, is based upon the principles and governance practices highlighted below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Compensation Design and Governing Principles   
• Pay is tied to performance:   
     ○    Approximately 83% of the CEO's target annual compensation and 70% of the other named executive officers' target annual compensation is at-risk and varies based on performance against incentive goals as well as the performance of Company stock.  
     ○   There is an appropriate balance of annual and long-term incentives, and the metrics used in the annual plan are different from the metrics used in the long-term incentive plan.  
     ○   The annual incentive plan for the named executive officers is based upon the achievement of established corporate performance goals.  
     ○   Two-thirds of the long-term incentive opportunity is based on the achievement of established corporate performance goals.  
     ○   Dividend equivalents are not accrued or paid on performance awards that are not notionally earned.  
• Executives who participate in the long-term incentive plan are required to meet minimum levels of stock ownership and the status of stock ownership is reviewed on an annual basis.  
• None of the named executive officers has an employment agreement.  
• Executive officers, including named executive officers, receive the same group benefits as other salaried employees, including health, life insurance, disability, and retirement benefits. They are also eligible to participate in a non-qualified supplementary benefit plan designed to restore 401(k) benefits lost due to Internal Revenue Code (Code) statutory limits.   
• Executive officer perquisites are limited and reviewed annually. There are no tax gross-ups on perquisites other than for travel expenses of a spouse when accompanying an executive to participate in business-related activities.  
• The Company maintains a double trigger requirement for change in control severance benefits and for the acceleration of time-based equity awards, including restricted stock units and stock options (provided the awards are assumed or replaced with substantially equivalent awards).  
• There are no excise tax gross-up provisions upon a change in control.  
 Benchmarking Philosophy and Risk Management  
• The Compensation Committee references the market median with respect to establishing compensation levels for the named executive officers.  
• To align with investor expectations and changes in the Company's business and market practices, compensation peer groups are regularly evaluated.  
• The Compensation Committee monitors all equity grants under the 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan, and the Company's three-year average burn rate is below the mean burn rate for the Russell 3000 companies in GICS group 2510 (Automobiles & Components).  
• The compensation program risk evaluation process is formalized, including an annual review of plans as described in Compensation-Related Risk Assessment on page 23. Risk mitigation is incorporated into plan design, including capping both annual and long-term incentive plan payouts.  
• The Compensation Committee regularly reviews all forms of compensation, including all cash and equity-based compensation grants, non-qualified account balances, and payments due upon termination of employment.  
• The Board has an established policy for recoupment (or clawback) of annual and long-term incentive compensation in the event of a restatement of reported financial results or if an employee has engaged in unethical conduct detrimental to the Company.  
• The Board has adopted an anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy.   
• Our executive compensation consultant is retained directly by and reports to the Compensation Committee, does not provide any services to management, and had no prior relationship with our CEO or any other named executive officer.
