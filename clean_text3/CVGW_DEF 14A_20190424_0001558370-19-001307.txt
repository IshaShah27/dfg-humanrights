QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROXY MATERIALS AND THE ANNUAL MEETING
Proxy Materials
Why am I receiving these materials?
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Calavo Growers, Inc. ("Calavo," the "Company," "we," our" or "us"), a California corporation, is providing these proxy materials for you in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders, which will take place on April 24, 2019.  As a shareholder, you are invited to attend the annual meeting and are entitled to, and requested to, vote on the items of business described in this proxy statement.

The proxy materials include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Our proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders;  
· Our 2018 Annual Report, which includes key information from our 2018 Form 10-K; and

[END TABLE]
What information is contained in this proxy statement?
The information included in this proxy statement relates to the proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting, the voting process, our Board and Board committees, the compensation of our directors and current executive officers for fiscal 2018, and other required information. How may I obtain a copy of Calavo's 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, Form 10-K and/or other financial information?
A copy of our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes key information from our 2018 Form 10-K, is enclosed.  Shareholders may request another free hard copy of our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and/or a free copy of our entire Form 10-K, from:
Corporate ControllerCalavo Growers, Inc. 1141A Cummings RoadSanta Paula, California 93060
(805) 525-1245
Calavo also will furnish any exhibit to our 2018 Form 10-K, if specifically requested, for a fee of $0.20 per page to cover our expenses.
Important Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to be Held on April 24,  2019
This proxy statement, the accompanying proxy, our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and our 2018 Form 10-K are also available on our website at http://www.calavo.com under "Investor Relations – Financial Information".
How may I request multiple sets of proxy materials if two or more shareholders reside in my household?
To minimize our expenses, one proxy statement and one annual report to shareholders may be delivered to two or more shareholders who share an address unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders.  We will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement and annual report to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the proxy statement and annual report was delivered.  Requests for additional copies of the proxy statement and annual report, and requests that in the future separate documents be sent to shareholders who share an address, should be directed by writing to Calavo Growers, Inc., 1141-A Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060, Attention James Snyder, or by calling Mr. Snyder at (805) 525-1245.

What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards.  For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares.  If you are a shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.  Please complete, sign, date, and return each Calavo proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.
Voting Information
What items of business will be voted on at the annual meeting?
The items of business scheduled to be voted on at the annual meeting are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The election of directors 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The ratification of Calavo's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year 
· Advisory vote on executive compensation 
[END TABLE]
We also will consider any other business that properly comes before the annual meeting.  See question below. 
What happens if additional matters are presented at the annual meeting?
Other than the three items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the annual meeting.  If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Lecil E. Cole and J. Link Leavens, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting.  If for any reason any of our nominees are not available as candidates for directors, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
Our Board recommends that you vote your shares FOR each of the thirteen nominees for election to the Board, FOR the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, and FOR the approval of the compensation of Calavo's named executive officers.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
Many Calavo shareholders hold their shares through a broker, or other nominee, rather than directly in their own names.  As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
Shareholder of Record 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record, and we are sending these proxy materials directly to you.  As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the meeting.  We have enclosed a proxy card for you to use. 
Beneficial Owner 
If your shares are held in a brokerage account, or by another nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, trustee or nominee together with a voting instruction card.  As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee or nominee how to vote and are also invited to attend the annual meeting. 
Since a beneficial owner is not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting, unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, trustee or nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.  Your broker, trustee or nominee should provide voting instructions for you to use in directing the broker, trustee or nominee how to vote your shares. 
What shares can I vote?
Each share of Calavo common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on February 26, 2019, the Record Date for the annual meeting, is entitled to be voted on all items being voted upon at the annual meeting.  You may vote all shares owned by you as of this time, including (1) shares held directly in your name as the shareholder of record, and (2) shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker, trustee or other nominee such as a bank.  On the Record Date, we estimate Calavo had approximately 17.6 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. How can I vote my shares in person at the annual meeting?
Shares held in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the annual meeting.  Shares held beneficially in street name may be voted in person at the annual meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, trustee or nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares.  Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or voting instructions as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting.
How can I vote my shares without attending the annual meeting?
Whether you hold shares directly as the shareholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the annual meeting.  If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by submitting a proxy.  If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker, trustee or nominee.  For directions on how to vote, please refer to the instructions below and those included on your proxy card or, for shares held beneficially in street name, the voting instruction card provided by your broker, trustee or nominee. 
Shareholders of record of Calavo common stock may submit proxies by completing, signing and dating their proxy cards and mailing them in the accompanying pre-addressed envelopes.  Calavo shareholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may vote by mail by completing, signing and dating the voting instruction card (generally obtained from your broker, trustee or nominee) provided and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope.   The voting instruction card provided by your broker, trustee or nominee may also provide you with the option to vote by telephone or the internet.
What is the deadline for voting my shares?
If you hold shares as the shareholder of record, your vote by proxy must be received before the polls close at the annual meeting. 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee or other nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, trustee or nominee. 
May I change my vote?
You may change your vote at any time prior to the vote at the annual meeting.  If you are the shareholder of record, you may change your vote at any time before it is voted at the meeting by transmitting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy), by sending a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary for receipt prior to the meeting at the address shown under the question below titled, "What is the deadline to propose actions for consideration at next year's annual meeting of shareholders?" or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person.   Attendance at the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically make that request.  For shares you hold beneficially in the name of a broker, trustee or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, trustee or nominee, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker or nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person. 
Is my vote confidential?
Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy.  Your vote will not be disclosed either within Calavo or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, and  Table of Contents
(3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.  Occasionally, shareholders provide on their proxy card written comments, which are then forwarded to Calavo management. 
How may I vote on each proposal?
In the election of directors, you may vote "FOR," "WITHHOLD AUTHORITY" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each of the nominees.   
In the election of directors, you also may cumulate your votes as described in the question below titled, "Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors?"
You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year.  
You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to the advisory vote on executive compensation.  
If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items.  If you vote by proxy card or voting instruction card and sign the card without giving specific instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board (FOR all of our nominees to the Board, FOR ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and FOR the advisory approval of the compensation of Calavo's named executive officers). 
What happens if a director nominee receives a greater number of "WITHHELD" votes than "FOR" votes?
If a director nominee in an uncontested election receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" from his or her election than votes "FOR" that director's election, the nominee shall promptly offer his or her resignation to the Board. A committee consisting of the Board's independent directors (which will specifically exclude any director who is required to offer his or her own resignation) shall consider all relevant factors and decide on behalf of the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation and will determine whether to accept the resignation or take other action. The Company will publicly disclose the Board's decision with regard to any resignation offered under these circumstances with an explanation of how the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the offered resignation.
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?
In the election of directors, the thirteen director candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected.  Approval to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year and approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy and voting on that proposal at the annual meeting.   
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote your shares on routine matters, but cannot vote your shares on non-routine matters.  If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
Broker non-votes and abstentions will not affect the outcome of any of the proposals to be voted upon. Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"? 
The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal No. 2) is considered routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal No. 2. 
The election of directors (Proposal No. 1), and the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 3) are considered non-routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters and, as a result, there may be broker non-votes on Proposals Nos. 1 and 3.   
Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors?
In the election of directors, you may elect to cumulate your vote.  Cumulative voting will allow you to allocate among the director nominees, as you see fit, the total number of votes equal to the number of director positions to be filled multiplied by the number of shares you hold.  For example, if you own 100 shares of stock and there are 13 directors to be elected at the annual meeting, you may allocate 1,300 "FOR" votes (13 times 100) among as few or as many of the 13 nominees to be voted on at the annual meeting as you choose.  You may not cumulate your votes against a nominee. 
If you are a shareholder of record and choose to cumulate your votes, you will need to submit a proxy card or, if you vote in person at the annual meeting, submit a ballot and make an explicit statement of your intent to cumulate your votes, either by so indicating in writing on the proxy card or by indicating in writing on your ballot when voting at the annual meeting.  If you hold shares beneficially through a broker, trustee or other nominee and wish to cumulate votes, you should contact your broker, trustee or nominee. 
If you vote by proxy card or voting instruction card and sign your card with no further instructions, Lecil E. Cole and J. Link Leavens, as proxy holders, may cumulate and cast your votes in favor of the election of some or all of the applicable nominees in their sole discretion, except that none of your votes will be cast for any nominee as to whom you vote against or abstain from voting. 
Cumulative voting applies only to the election of directors.  For all other matters, each share of common stock outstanding as of the close of business on February 26, 2019, the record date for the annual meeting, is entitled to one vote. 
Who will serve as inspector of elections?
The inspector of elections will be a representative from investor communication company Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the annual meeting?
We are making this solicitation and will pay substantially all of the costs of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes.  We have retained Broadridge Financial Solutions, to assist with the distribution and tabulation of proxies from the shareholders of record for approximately $25,000.  We will also reimburse banks, brokers or other nominees for their costs of sending our proxy materials to beneficial owners.  Directors, officers or other employees of ours may also solicit proxies from shareholders in person, by telephone, facsimile transmission or other electronic means of communication without additional compensation. Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting?
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and publish final results on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC shortly after our annual meeting.
What if I have questions for Calavo's transfer agent?
Please contact our transfer agent, contact information listed below, with questions concerning stock certificates, dividend checks, transfer of ownership or other matters pertaining to your stock account.

How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the annual meeting?
The quorum requirement for holding the annual meeting and transacting business is that holders of a majority of shares of our common stock entitled to vote must be present in person or represented by proxy.  Both abstentions and broker non-votes described previously in the question above titled, "What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?" are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

*Member.
**Chair.
Executive Committee.  The Executive Committee exercises the authority of the Board of Directors when the Board is not in session, as permitted by law and by policy.  
Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee assists the Board and management in fulfilling their responsibilities for generally overseeing our financial reporting processes and the audit of our financial statements, including the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of our internal audit function and the independent registered public accounting firm, and risk assessment and risk management.  Among other things, the Audit Committee prepares the Audit Committee report for inclusion in the annual proxy statement; appoints, evaluates and determines the compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm; reviews and approves the scope of the annual audit, the audit fee and the financial statements; reviews our disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, internal audit function, and corporate policies with respect to financial information and earnings guidance; oversees investigations into complaints concerning financial matters; reviews other risks that may have a significant impact on our financial statements; and reviews transactions with related persons.  The Audit Committee works closely with management, as well as the independent registered public accounting firm.  
The Board has determined that Egidio Carbone, Jr. and Michael A. DiGregorio are audit committee financial experts as defined by SEC rules and applicable listing standards. 
The report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is included in the proxy statement on page 42.  The charter of the Audit Committee is on our website at www.calavo.com under "Investor Relations – Corporate Governance".    
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends candidates to be nominated for election as directors at our annual meeting, consistent with criteria approved by the Board; develops and reviews corporate governance principles and related policies for approval by the Board; periodically assesses the size and composition of the Board, including developing and reviewing director qualifications for approval by the Board; considers director candidates proposed by shareholders; reviews proposed changes to our  Table of Contents
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; and reviews shareholder proposals in conjunction with the Chairman of the Board and recommends Board responses.    
The charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is on our website at www.calavo.com under "Investor Relations – Corporate Governance".
Compensation Committee.   The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Compensation Committee report required by the SEC for inclusion in the annual proxy statement and has authority to retain compensation consultants.  Other specific duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include reviewing and approving objectives relevant to executive officer compensation; determining the compensation of executive officers in accordance with those objectives; approving severance arrangements and other applicable agreements for executive officers; overseeing our equity-based and incentive compensation plans for executive officers; and recommending compensation policies and practices for service on the Board and its committees.  The Compensation Committee may not delegate its duties or responsibilities within the scope of its authority pursuant to its charter.  For a description of the processes and procedures used by the Compensation Committee for the consideration and determination of executive and director compensation, see "Executive Compensation-Compensation Discussion and Analysis."  
The charter of the Compensation Committee is posted on our website at www.calavo.com under "Investor Relations – Corporate Governance".
Leadership Structure
The leadership structure of the Board of Directors is centered on the concept of an appropriate balance between management and the Board of Directors.  The Board believes that it is in the best interest of Calavo and its shareholders for the Board to make a determination regarding whether or not to separate the roles of Chairman and CEO based upon applicable facts and circumstances.  The Board believes that presently it is in the best interest of Calavo and its shareholders that the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO should not be separated.  Mr. Cole's diverse history with Calavo, from both an operational standpoint and that of a member of management, are vital to the Board's collective knowledge of Calavo's day-to-day operations.  
Although the Board has not designated any other director to serve as its "lead independent director," all of Calavo's other directors have access to the CEO and other Calavo executives on request.  In addition, all but two of Calavo's independent directors serve actively on Board committees and may request agenda topics to be addressed at Board and committee meetings. 
Risk Oversight
The Board identifies and reviews with senior corporate management issues concerning the key areas of business and financial risk to which Calavo is exposed.  In this context "business and financial risk" is broadly construed to include risks, of whatever nature or source:  (1) to the achievement of Calavo's strategic or tactical objectives and its financial plans; (2) to management effectiveness; (3) to Calavo's reputation or legal position; and (4) to Calavo's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee the duty to consider whether Calavo's compensation practices and policies for its executive officers create unnecessary risks to Calavo.  The Compensation Committee reports back to the full Board with respect to its assessment.
Director Nominees 
Shareholder Nominees 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider shareholder nominations for candidates for membership on the Board.  In evaluating such nominations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks  Table of Contents to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board.  Any shareholder nominations proposed for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should include the nominee's name and qualifications for Board membership and should be addressed to: 
Corporate SecretaryCalavo Growers, Inc.1141-A Cummings RoadSanta Paula, CA 93060
In addition, our bylaws permit shareholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual shareholders' meeting by following the procedures set forth in our bylaws.  See "Questions and Answers— What is the deadline to propose actions for consideration at next year's annual meeting of shareholders?" above.
Director Qualifications 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that members of the Board should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values, consistent with longstanding Calavo values and standards.  They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government, education, technology or public interest. They should be committed to enhancing shareholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience.  Their service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform responsibly all director duties. Each director must represent the interests of all shareholders.  
Neither the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee nor the Board has a written policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. However, in recommending candidates for appointment or election to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to have a Board consisting of directors with diverse backgrounds, skills, experiences and expertise and considers factors such as industry experience, unique expertise, gender diversity and other background diversity and prior business leadership and board positions.  
Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Director
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will periodically assess the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise.  In the event that vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider various potential candidates for director. Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, shareholders or other persons.  These candidates will be evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and may be considered at any point during the year.  As described above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers shareholder nominations for candidates for the Board.  If any materials are provided by a shareholder in connection with the nomination of a director candidate, such materials will be forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also review materials provided by professional search firms or other parties in connection with a nominee who is not proposed by a shareholder.
Director Compensation
Each of our non-employee directors is paid a $15,000 annual retainer for services rendered from January to December and is reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the performance of his or her service as a director.  The chairs of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee each received an additional retainer of $10,000, and the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received an additional retainer of $5,000.  Each non-employee director also receives cash compensation of $2,000 for each day of attendance at each Board meeting.   Table of Contents
Additionally, committee members receive $500 per committee meeting attended, although members of the Executive Committee receive a meeting fee of $1,000 per Executive Committee meeting attended.  Directors may, from time to time, be compensated related to their involvement in special projects, as determined by the Board of Directors.
In January 2019,  all 12 of our non-employee directors were granted 1,750 restricted shares each (total of 21,000 shares).  These shares have full voting rights and participate in dividends as if unrestricted.  The closing price of our stock on such date was $71.56.  As of January 2, 2020, these shares will vest and be unrestricted.

 PROPOSAL NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
There are thirteen nominees for election to our Board this year.  All of the nominees have served as directors since the last annual meeting.  Each director is elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is elected.  There are no family relationships among our executive officers and directors. 
The thirteen director candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes at the annual meeting will be elected. If a director nominee in an uncontested election receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" from his or her election than votes "FOR" that director's election, the nominee shall promptly offer his or her resignation to the Board. A committee consisting of the Board's independent directors (which will specifically exclude any director who is required to offer his or her own resignation) shall consider all relevant factors and decide on behalf of the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation and will determine whether to accept the resignation or take other action. The Company will publicly disclose the Board's decision with regard to any resignation offered under these circumstances with an explanation of how the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the offered resignation.
If you sign your proxy or voting instruction card, but do not give instructions with respect to voting for directors, your shares will be voted for the thirteen persons recommended by the Board.  If you wish to give specific instructions with respect to voting for directors, you may do so by indicating your instructions on your proxy or voting instruction card. 
You may cumulate your votes in favor of one or more directors.  If you wish to cumulate your votes, you will need to indicate explicitly your intent to cumulate your votes among the thirteen persons who will be voted upon at the annual meeting.  See "Questions and Answers—Voting Information—Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors?" for further information about how to cumulate your votes.  
All of the nominees have indicated to Calavo that they will be available to serve as directors.  In the event that any nominee should become unavailable, however, the proxy holders, Mr. Cole and Mr. Leavens, will vote for a nominee or nominees designated by the Board.

The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019.  We are asking our shareholders to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP.  During fiscal 2018,  Deloitte & Touche LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm.

Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to attend the annual meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, make a statement.  
If the appointment is not ratified by our shareholders, the Board will consider whether it should select another independent registered public accounting firm.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year.  
PROPOSAL NO. 3 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), as set forth in Section 14A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are asking Calavo's shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules.  At the 2018 Annual Meeting of shareholders, the shareholders approved an advisory measure that the shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation be held on an annual basis.  The Board determined to follow the shareholders' recommendations and to include an annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of Calavo's executive officers.  Our five named executive officers are identified below in the Summary Compensation Table.
Calavo has a "pay-for-performance" philosophy that forms the foundation of all decisions regarding compensation of Calavo's named executive officers. This compensation philosophy, and the program structure approved by the Compensation Committee, is central to Calavo's ability to attract, retain and motivate individuals who can achieve superior financial results and significant growth. Please refer to "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for an overview of the compensation of Calavo's named executive officers. 
We are asking for shareholder approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules, which disclosures include the disclosures under "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and the narrative discussion following the compensation tables. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the policies and practices described in this proxy statement.  Accordingly, we are asking you to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Calavo Growers, Inc., as disclosed in the 2019 Proxy Statement of Calavo Growers, Inc., pursuant to Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, hereby is approved.
This vote is advisory and therefore is not binding on Calavo, the Compensation Committee of the Board, or the Board. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of Calavo's shareholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider those shareholders' concerns, and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Calavo common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal at the annual meeting is required for advisory approval of this proposal. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of Calavo's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC reports regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our securities.  We believe that, during fiscal year 2018, our directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements, with the following exceptions: James Gibson (late on one Form 4 representing one transaction) and Egidio Carbone (late on one Form 4 representing one transaction).  In making this statement, we have relied upon our examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments thereto, provided to us and the written representations of our directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders.  
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Calavo has adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between Calavo and its directors, director nominees, executive officers, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective immediate family members where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is expected to exceed $100,000 in a single calendar year. 
The policy provides that the Audit Committee reviews transactions subject to the policy and decides whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions.  In doing so, the Audit Committee determines whether the transaction is in the best interests of Calavo.  In making that determination, the Audit Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The extent of the related person's interest in the transaction;  
· Whether the transaction is on terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances;  
· The benefits to Calavo;  
· The impact or potential impact on a director's independence in the event the related party is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer;  
· The availability of other sources for comparable products or services; and  
· The terms of the transaction.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has delegated authority to the chair of the Audit Committee to pre-approve or ratify transactions where the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $200,000.  A summary of any new transactions pre-approved by the chair is provided to the full Board of Directors for its review in connection with the Board's regularly scheduled meetings. 
The Audit Committee has adopted standing pre-approvals under the policy for limited transactions with related persons. Pre-approved transactions include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.      Director compensation approved by the Board or the Compensation Committee;  
    2.      Transactions valued at the lesser than $200,000 or 2% of the other company's consolidated gross revenues, where the related person has an interest only as an employee (other than executive officer), director or beneficial holder of less than 10% of the other company's shares;  
    3.      Transactions where all shareholders receive proportional benefits; and 
    4.      Avocados delivered to us from our directors pursuant to our customary marketing agreements, as discussed below. 
[END TABLE]
Six of our thirteen directors are controlling shareholders, partners, executive officers and/or employees of entities that market in excess of $120,000 per year of avocados through us pursuant to customary marketing agreements during the 2018 fiscal year.  During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, we paid the following amounts to each of those six directors or to an entity affiliated with the director with respect to avocados marketed through us: Table of Contents

During fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, we received $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million as dividend income from Limoneira.  In addition, we lease office space from Limoneira for our corporate office.  Rent to Limoneira amounted to approximately $0.3 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016.  Harold Edwards, who is a member of our Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of Limoneira Company. We have less than 10% ownership interest in Limoneira.  Additionally, our Chief Executive Officer was formerly a member of the Limoneira Board of Directors.  In December 2018, our Chief Executive Officer retired from Limoneira's Board of Directors.
We currently have a member of our Board of Directors who also serves as a member of the law firm of TroyGould PC, which frequently represents Calavo as legal counsel. During the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, Calavo Growers, Inc. paid fees totaling approximately $0.2 million to TroyGould PC.  
As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, we have an investment of $19.9 million and $28.4 million in FreshRealm, LLC ("FreshRealm"). 
Effective July 31, 2018, we entered into a Note and Membership Unit Purchase Agreement ("NMUPA") with FreshRealm, pursuant to which we agreed to provide additional financing to FreshRealm, subject to certain terms and conditions.  Pursuant to such NMUPA, we entered into a Subscription Agreement with FreshRealm, whereby we purchased $3.5 million of equity units in FreshRealm, on July 31, 2018.  FreshRealm concurrently entered into subscription agreements with certain third-party investors for an additional $3.5 million of equity investments.  As of October 31, 2018, our ownership percentage in FreshRealm was approximately 37%.  
Additionally, pursuant to such NMUPA, we entered into a $12 million Senior Promissory Note and corresponding Security Agreement (collectively, the "Agreements") with FreshRealm, effective August 10, 2018.  Pursuant to the Agreements, the $12 million facility is available in two $6 million tranches.  On August 10, 2018, we funded the first $6 million tranche to FreshRealm.  The second $6 million tranche initially was available to FreshRealm upon its attainment of least $17 million in gross revenues over any consecutive two calendar months (i.e. in aggregate). In October 2018, we waived the sales threshold requirement and loaned FreshRealm $3.0 million.  In November 2018, we again waived the sales threshold and loaned the remaining $3.0 million. 
Three officers and five members of our board of directors have investments in FreshRealm.  In addition, as of October 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a loan to FreshRealm members of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million. In October 2017 and December 2017, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer invested $7.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, into FreshRealm.  In January 2018, one of our non-executive directors invested $1.8 million into FreshRealm. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, two of our non-executive directors invested $1.2 million into FreshRealm. The previous owners of RFG, one of which is currently an officer of Calavo, have a majority ownership of certain entities that provide various services to RFG, specifically LIG Partners, LLC and THNC, LLC.  One of RFG's California operating facilities leases a building from LIG Partners, LLC (LIG) pursuant to an operating lease.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Overview 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis explains the material elements of the compensation that was awarded to, earned by, or paid to each of our executive officers who is named below in the Summary Compensation Table during our 2018 fiscal year.  Those executive officers are referred to below as the "named executive officers." 
At the 2018 annual meeting of the shareholders, the shareholders on an advisory basis, approved the compensation of the executive officers of Calavo as disclosed in Calavo's 2018 proxy statement.  Based in part upon the results of this shareholder advisory vote, the Compensation Committee has determined to follow the shareholders' recommendation and to continue to follow its compensation policies and procedures. 
Compensation Program Objectives and Philosophy 
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the design and administration of the compensation program for our executive officers.  The Compensation Committee's primary objectives in structuring and administering our executive officer compensation program are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· attract, motivate and retain talented and dedicated executive officers; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· tie annual and long-term cash and stock incentives to achievement of measurable corporate and individual performance objectives; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· reinforce business strategies and objectives for enhanced shareholder value. 
[END TABLE]
To achieve these goals, the Compensation Committee maintains compensation plans that tie a portion of executive officers' overall compensation to key strategic goals, such as financial and operational performance, as measured by metrics, such as net income or adjusted net income.  The Compensation Committee evaluates individual executive performance with a goal of setting compensation at levels the Committee believes are comparable with those of executive officers at other public companies having a similar size and, generally, line of business, while taking into account our relative performance and our own strategic goals. 
The principal elements of our executive compensation program are base salaries, annual cash bonus awards that are based upon the achievement of objective performance goals such as net income levels, restricted stock grants, and other benefits and perquisites.  Our other benefits and perquisites consist of life, disability and health insurance benefits, a qualified 401(k) savings plan and automobile allowances. The Compensation Committee also awards discretionary cash and/or stock-based bonuses in appropriate circumstances.
We view these components of compensation as related, but distinct.  Although the Compensation Committee does review total compensation, we do not believe that significant compensation derived from one component of compensation should negate or offset compensation from other components.  We determine the appropriate level for each compensation component based in part, but not exclusively, on competitive benchmarking consistent with our recruiting and retention goals, our view of internal equity and consistency, and other considerations we deem relevant, such as rewarding extraordinary performance. Determination of Compensation Awards 
The Compensation Committee typically performs an annual strategic review of our executive officers' compensation to determine whether such compensation provides adequate incentives and motivation to our executive officers and whether it adequately compensates our executive officers relative to comparable officers in other similarly situated companies.  The Compensation Committee's most recent review occurred in January 2019. 
From time to time, the Compensation Committee's meetings include, for all or a portion of each meeting, the Committee members, our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, a recording secretary and/or other Board members.  For compensation decisions relating to executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee considers recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer.  
When determining compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee considers such factors as competitive industry salaries, an assessment of the Chief Executive Officer's contributions made during the preceding year and his industry expertise.  Our Chief Executive Officer does not attend the portion of the Compensation Committee's meetings regarding his compensation. 
Prior to December 22, 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") was signed into law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million per officer in any year that did not qualify as performance-based. In connection with fiscal 2018 compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considered the potential tax deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and sought to qualify certain elements of these applicable executives' compensation as performance-based while also delivering competitive levels and forms of compensation.
Under the TCJA, the performance-based exception has been repealed and the $1 million deduction limit now applies to anyone serving as the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year and the top three other highest compensated executive officers serving at fiscal year-end. The new rules generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but do not apply to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect after that date.
Review of Compensation Surveys
The Compensation Committee believes that it is important when making its compensation-related decisions to be informed as to the current practices of similarly situated companies.  As a result, the Compensation Committee, from time to time, reviews broad-based third-party surveys and other information collected from public and private sources regarding the compensation for executive officers of comparably sized companies.   The Compensation Committee considers the information in these surveys in connection with establishing the base salaries, performance-compensation awards, equity awards and other benefits and perquisites for our named executive officers.  
During fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation consultant, Mercer, Inc. ("Mercer").  In September 2017, the Compensation Committee received from Mercer reports that provided analyses and recommendations regarding compensation for Calavo's non-employee directors and executive officers, including information about compensation for peer group companies, updates on executive compensation market trends and recommendations regarding short-term and long-term executive compensation incentive programs.  Pursuant to applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Mercer and determined that it is an independent compensation consultant.  Mercer does not provide any other services to Calavo, and the Compensation Committee met with Mercer outside the presence of Calavo management.  
The Compensation Committee does not believe that the compensation of our named executive officers should be established solely by reference to the compensation programs of other companies or that the compensation of our named  Table of Contents executive officers should be set as a specified percentage of the average compensation that is paid to executive officers of other companies.  However, the Compensation Committee believes that collecting and reviewing this compensation survey information is a useful resource in providing information about current compensation practices and in confirming that Calavo's executive compensation program remains competitive. 
Base Salaries 
We provide our named executive officers with base salaries that we believe enable us to hire and retain individuals in a competitive environment and to reward individual performance and contribution to our overall business goals, while taking into account the unique circumstances of our company.  We review base salaries for our named executive officers annually, and increases are based on our performance and individual performance. 
The Compensation Committee increased our named executive officers' base salaries for the 2018 fiscal year to the following amounts:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Executive Officer            Base Salary for Fiscal 2018       
  Lecil Cole         $    765,000        
  B. John Lindeman         $    374,920        
  Ronald Araiza         $    348,140        
  Michael Browne         $    348,140        
  Robert Wedin         $    348,140        
[END TABLE]
In awarding these base salary increases, the Compensation Committee reviewed the base salaries that are paid to executive officers by the peer group companies in Mercer's compensation survey referred to above under "Review of Compensation Surveys."  The Compensation Committee believes that this increase in executive officers' base salaries was necessary to retain these executive officers in a competitive market.  
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee increased the named executive officers' annual base salaries.  Mr. Cole's annual base salary increased to approximately $800,000,  Mr. Lindeman's base salary increased to approximately $425,000 and the base salaries of Messrs. Araiza,  Browne, and Wedin increased to approximately $375,000.  In awarding these increases, the Committee primarily considered the base salaries paid by our peer companies to similarly situated executives.  
The Compensation Committee believes that this increase in these base annual salaries was necessary to continue to retain these services in a competitive market.  
For 2018, the base salaries accounted for approximately 50% of total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and approximately 49% on average for our other named executive officers.
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by applicable SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the total annual compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
The Median of the annual total worldwide compensation of our employees (other than our CEO) was $3,885.
The total annual compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this proxy was  $1,468,667.  
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees was 378 to 1.We took the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We determined that, for fiscal 2018, our employee population consisted of 4,478 individuals.  This population consisted of full time, part time and seasonal employees employed with us at any point in fiscal 2018.  65% of the total employee population was from Mexico.  The remaining 35% of the total employee population was from the United States. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· For the annual total compensation of our median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of that employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x), resulting in annual total compensation of $3,885.

Annual Performance-Based Bonus Awards 
During each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee evaluates our bonus compensation practices in light of the objectives of the compensation program.  As a result of this evaluation, the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate for our executive officers to be eligible to receive performance-based compensation upon the achievement of specified performance goals.  During the 2018 fiscal year, the performance-based goal was based upon our net income.  For each named executive officer, the Compensation Committee provided that the executive officer would receive a percentage of our net income if we achieved a threshold net income of $41,000,000.   
The Compensation Committee believes that basing bonuses on the achievement of specified levels of net income provides a correlation between executive compensation and company performance.  A named executive officer's entitlement to a performance-based payment is not accelerated in the event of the executive officer's termination of employment.
For the 2018 fiscal year, the percentage of our net income that each named executive officer was entitled to receive as a performance-based bonus was as follows:

COMPENSATION RISK
Our Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation policies and practices of Calavo that could have a material impact on Calavo. The Compensation Committee's review considered whether any of these policies and practices may encourage inappropriate risk-taking, whether any policy or practice may give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us, and whether it would recommend any changes to the Calavo's compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee also reviewed with the Board of Directors risk-mitigating controls such as the degree of committee and senior management oversight of each compensation program and the level and design of internal controls over such programs.  Based on these reviews, Calavo determined that risks arising from its compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Calavo.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
In fiscal 2018, the members of our Compensation Committee were Steven Hollister, Kathleen Holmgren, and Michael DiGregorio, who are all non-employee directors.  None of such committee members (1) was an officer or employee of Calavo or any of our subsidiaries during or prior to the time they served on the Compensation Committee or (2) had any relationship requiring disclosure by us pursuant to any paragraph of Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K. None of the Company's executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a company that has an executive officer that serves as or served as a member of our Board or compensation committee. 
STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS OF CALAVO GROWERS, INC.
In April 2011, our shareholders approved the Calavo Growers, Inc. 2011 Management Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan).  All directors, officers, employees and consultants (including prospective directors, officers, employees and consultants) of Calavo and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2011 Plan.  Up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock may be issued by Calavo under the 2011 Plan.  In April 2016, our shareholders reapproved the performance criteria in the 2011 Plan.
The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to promote the interests of Calavo Growers, Inc. and its shareholders by (a) attracting, retaining and motivating directors, officers, employees and consultants (including prospective directors, officers, employees and consultants) of the Company and its affiliates and (b) enabling such individuals to participate in the growth and financial success of the Company. 
The 2011 Plan authorizes the granting of awards in a variety of forms, including the following types of awards to persons who are employees, officers, consultants, advisors, or directors of Calavo or any of its affiliates:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· "Incentive stock options" that are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· "Non-qualified stock options" that are not intended to be incentive stock options; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Shares of common stock that are subject to specified restrictions. 
[END TABLE]
Subject to the adjustment provisions of the 2011 Plan that are applicable in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction, up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the 2011 Plan and no person shall be granted awards under the 2011 Plan during any 12-month period that cover more than  150,000 shares of common stock. The 2011 Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for selecting the officers, employees, directors, consultants and advisers, if any, who will receive options and restricted stock.  Subject to the requirements imposed by the 2011 Plan, the Compensation Committee is also responsible for determining the terms and conditions of each option award, including the number of shares subject to the option, the exercise price, expiration date and vesting period of the option and whether the option is an incentive stock option or a non-qualified stock option.   Subject to the requirements imposed by the 2011 Plan, the Compensation Committee is also responsible for determining the terms and conditions of each restricted stock grant, including the number of shares granted, the purchase price (if any) and the vesting, transfer and other restrictions imposed on the stock.   The Compensation Committee has the power, authority and discretion to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2011 Plan or of any award under the 2011 Plan.  
Under current law, only officers and other employees are entitled to receive incentive stock options.  The exercise price for an incentive stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant of the option.  With respect to an option holder who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total voting power of all classes of our stock, the exercise price for an incentive stock option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant of the option.  The 2011 Plan also requires that the exercise price for non-qualified stock options not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant of the option. 
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, options granted under the 2011 Plan are generally not transferable, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Except as otherwise provided in the option agreement, an option ceases to be exercisable ninety days after the termination of the option holder's employment with us.
The Board of Directors may, at any time, amend, discontinue or terminate the 2011 Plan.  With specified exceptions, no amendment, suspension or termination of the plan may adversely affect outstanding options or the terms that are applicable to outstanding restricted stock.  No amendment or suspension of the 2011 Plan requires shareholder approval unless such approval is required under applicable law or under the rules of any stock exchange or NASDAQ market on which our stock is traded.   
Officers are required to own 4,000 share of Common Stock.  If an Officer does not own 4,000 shares, the Officer must retain 60% of awarded shares, once vested, until the date that the Officer owns at least 4,000 shares of Common stock.  Once the Officer owns at least 4,000 shares of Common Stock, the Officer shall not be required to retain any awarded shares, once vested, so long as the Officer at all times thereafter continues to own at least 4,000 shares of Common Stock during the period that he or she is a director of Calavo.
Recoupment of Awards
If, due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement of the United States securities laws, rules and regulations, the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements, the Company shall take the following actions with respect to each Award that was granted under the Plan during the three-year period preceding the date on which the Company becomes required to prepare such restatement, regardless as to whether such restatement is attributable to any Participant's or other Person's negligence, fraud or other misconduct:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (i)      If an Award is unpaid, unvested or unexercised, the Company shall cancel all or a portion of the Award, if and to the extent that the Committee determines that the Award to the Participant was based upon erroneous data contained in the Company's financial statements and was in excess of the Award that the Participant would have received based upon the Company's restated financial statements; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (ii)      If any Shares have been issued by the Company to the Participant under the Award and have vested, the Participant shall be required to transfer to the Company, for no consideration, all or a portion of such Shares or a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares as of the date of the restated financial statements, if and to the extent that the Committee determines that the Award of such Shares received by the Participant was based upon erroneous data contained in the Company's financial statements and was in excess of the Shares that the Participant would have received based upon the Company's restated financial statements; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (iii)      If an Award has been paid in cash by the Company to the Participant under the Award, the Participant shall be required to return to the Company, for no consideration, all or a portion of such cash, if and to the extent that the Committee determines that the Award of such cash payment received by the Participant was based upon erroneous data contained in the Company's financial statements and was in excess of the cash payment that the Participant would have received based upon the Company's restated financial statements.

All services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP were approved by the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee has adopted an approval policy that requires the pre-approval by the audit committee of all services to be performed for us by Deloitte & Touche LLP.  The policy authorizes the Audit Committee to delegate to one or more of its members approval authority with respect to permitted services.  Pursuant to this policy, the Board delegated such authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.  All approval decisions must be reported to the Audit Committee at its next meeting.  The audit committee has concluded the provision of the non-audit services listed above is compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte & Touche LLP. REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Audit Committee has the responsibilities set forth in the Audit Committee Charter which include but are not limited to representing and assisting the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for general oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm, and risk assessment and risk management.  The Audit Committee also manages our relationship with our independent registered public accounting firm (which reports directly to the Audit Committee).  The Audit Committee has the authority to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting or other advisors as the Audit Committee deems necessary to carry out its duties and receives appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, from Calavo for such advice and assistance. 
Our management is primarily responsible for our internal control and financial reporting process.  Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and issuing opinions on the conformity of those audited financial statements with United States generally accepted accounting principles and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors our financial reporting process and reports to the Board on its findings. 
In this context, the Audit Committee hereby reports as follows:
1.  The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with our management.
2.  The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB").  
3.  The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. 
4.  Based on the review and discussions referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The undersigned members of the Audit Committee have submitted this Report to the Board of Directors.
