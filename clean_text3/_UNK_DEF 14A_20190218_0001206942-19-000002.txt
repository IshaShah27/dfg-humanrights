Members do not have cumulative voting rights.  In the director election, because directors are elected by plurality vote, abstentions and withheld votes will not be counted either for or against any nominee.  Abstentions and withheld votes will be included when counting units to determine whether a sufficient number of the voting membership units are represented to establish a quorum.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: On January 4, 2019, the record date, there were 18,953,000 outstanding Class A membership units and 920,000 outstanding Class B membership units for a total of 19,873,000 units outstanding.

[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The presence of members holding 30% of the total outstanding Class A and B membership units entitled to vote on the matter, or 5,061,900 membership units for the election of directors, regardless of class, constitutes a quorum.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What happens if I mark too few or too many boxes on the proxy card? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If you do not mark any choices on the proxy card, then the proxies will vote your units FOR the incumbent directors Stan Laures, Roger Shaffer and Dave Sovereign.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition, a member may nominate a candidate for director by following the procedures explained in Section 5.2(c) of the Operating Agreement.  Section 5.2(c) of the Operating Agreement requires that written notice of a member's intent to nominate an individual for director must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the secretary of the Company not less than 120 calendar days prior to the one year anniversary of the date when the Company's proxy statement was released in connection with the previous year's annual meeting.  Director nominations submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Operating Agreement must be submitted to the Company by September 6, 2019.                                           
Q: What is a member proposal? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: A member proposal is your recommendation or requirement that the Company and/or the Board take action, which you intend to present at a meeting of the Company's members.  Your proposal should state as clearly as possible the course of action that you believe the Company should follow.  If your proposal is included in the Company's proxy statement, then the Company must also provide the means for members to vote on the matter via the proxy card. The deadlines and procedures for submitting member proposals are explained in the following question and answer.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: When are member proposals due for the 2020 annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In order to be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, member proposals must be submitted in writing to the Company by September 6, 2019.  The Company suggests that member proposals for the 2020 annual meeting of the members be submitted by certified mail-return receipt requested. 
[END TABLE]
Members who intend to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of members without including such proposal in the Company's proxy statement must provide the Company notice of such proposal no later than November 20, 2019.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.  
If the Company does not receive notice of a member proposal intended to be submitted to the 2020 annual meeting by November 20, 2019, the persons named on the proxy card accompanying the notice of meeting may vote on any such proposal in their discretion, provided the Company has included in its proxy statement an explanation of its intention with respect to voting on the proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the effect of a broker non-vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: While we do not believe that any of our units are held in street name by brokers, broker non-votes, if any, will count for purposes of establishing a quorum at the 2019 Annual Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when an individual owns units which are held in the name of a broker. The individual is the beneficial owner of the units, however, on the records of the Company, the broker owns the units. If the individual who beneficially owns the units does not provide the broker with voting instructions on non-routine matters, including the proposals presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, this is considered a broker non-vote. For such non-routine matters, the broker cannot vote either way and reports the units as "non-votes." These broker non-votes function as abstentions under our governing documents. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The entire cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by the Company.  The cost will include the cost of supplying necessary additional copies of the solicitation materials for beneficial owners of membership units held of record by brokers, dealers, banks and voting trustees and their nominees and, upon request, the reasonable expenses of such record holders for completing the mailing of such materials and reports to such beneficial owners.

[END TABLE]
The Board generally meets once per month.  The Board held twelve regularly scheduled meetings and one special meeting during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
The Board does not have a formalized process for holders of membership units to send communications to the Board. The Board feels this is reasonable given the accessibility of our directors.  Members desiring to communicate with the Board are free to do so by contacting a director.  The names of our directors are listed on the Company's website at www.ggecorn.com/contact/team/ or are available by calling the Company's office at (641) 423-8525.  
The Board does not have a policy with regard to directors' attendance at annual meetings. Last year, all directors, except for Leslie Hansen, Dave Reinhart and Steve Sukup, attended the Company's annual meeting.  Due to this high attendance record, it is the view of the Board that such a policy is unnecessary.
Director and Nominee Independence
All of our directors are independent, as defined by NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2).  Each of the director nominees are independent, as defined by NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2).  In evaluating the independence of our directors and nominees, we considered the following factors: (i) the business relationships of our directors and nominees; (ii) positions our directors and nominees hold with other companies; (iii) family relationships between our directors and nominees and other individuals involved with the Company; (iv) transactions between our directors and nominees and the Company; and (v) compensation arrangements between our directors and the Company. 
Board Leadership Structure and Role In Risk Oversight
The Company is managed by an Executive Vice President, Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer that are separate from the Chairman of the Board.  The Board has determined that its leadership structure is reasonable and effective to create checks and balances between the executive officers of the Company and the Board.  The Board is actively involved in overseeing all material risks that face the Company, including risks related to changes in commodity prices.  The Board administers its oversight functions by reviewing the operations of the Company, by overseeing the executive officers' management of the Company, and through its risk management committee.   Code of Ethics
The Board has adopted a Code of Ethics that sets forth standards regarding matters such as honest and ethical conduct, compliance with the law, and full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications.  The Code of Ethics applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.  The Code of Ethics is available free of charge on written request to Golden Grain Energy, LLC, 1822 43rd Street SW, Mason City, Iowa 50401.
Audit Committee
The Company has a standing audit committee.  The purpose of the audit committee is to monitor the integrity of the Company's financial reporting process and systems of internal controls.  The audit committee appoints and monitors the independence and qualifications of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (independent accountant), monitors the Company's internal control documentation, provides an avenue of communication among the independent accountant, management, and the Board, and prepares an audit committee report to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement.
The audit committee of the Board operates under a charter, adopted by the Board in Fall 2004, and updated in November  2014.  A copy of the audit committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.ggecorn.com.  Under the charter, the audit committee must have at least three members.  The Board has appointed Jim Boeding (chairperson), Leslie Hansen, Stan Laures, Roger Shaffer, Dave Sovereign and Steve Sukup to the audit committee.  The audit committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities. Nevertheless, all of our audit committee members are independent within the definition of independence provided by NASDAQ rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2).  A director would not be independent if they, or a family member, had been employed by the Company at any time during the last three years, accepted any compensation from the Company in excess of $120,000 during the last three years, or was a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of any organization which had extensive business dealings with the Company.  Additionally, directors serving on the audit committee must not have participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company at any time during the last three years.  
The Board has determined that Roger Shaffer qualifies as an audit committee financial expert.  Mr. Shaffer is a Certified Public Accountant.  Mr. Shaffer is independent within the definition of independence provided by NASDAQ rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2).  The audit committee held four meetings during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  All of our audit committee members, except Leslie Hansen, attended at least 75% of the audit committee meetings during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
Audit Committee Report
The audit committee delivered the following report to the Company's Board on December 21, 2018. The following report of the audit committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any previous or future documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the report by reference in any such document.
The audit committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  The audit committee has discussed with its independent auditor, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 Communication with Audit Committees, as amended, modified or supplemented.  The audit committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter to management from its independent auditor, as required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, and has discussed with management and the independent auditor the independent auditor's independence.  The audit committee has considered whether the provision of services by its independent auditor, not related to the audit of the financial statements referred to above and to the reviews of the interim financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q, are compatible with maintaining the independent auditor's independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

The fees charged by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm during the last two fiscal years are as follows:

All Other Fees(3)   2018   4,560   
    2017   —   
[END TABLE]

(3) All other fees consists of fees billed for network and information technology equipment and services.  
Prior to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform audit, tax and consulting services for the Company, the services were  pre-approved by our audit committee pursuant to the Company's policy requiring such approval. One hundred percent (100%) of all services were pre-approved by our audit committee.
Nominating Committee
The Board appointed Jim Boeding, Duane Lynch and Ron Pumphrey to the nominating committee for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  The nominating committee held one meeting in order to nominate candidates for the 2019 Annual Meeting and each member of the nominating committee attended the meeting.
The nominating committee oversees the identification and evaluation of individuals qualified to become directors and recommends to the Board the director nominees for each annual meeting of the members. The major responsibilities of the nominating committee are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Develop a nomination process for candidates to the Board; 
• Establish criteria and qualifications for membership to the Board;  
• Identify and evaluate potential director nominees; 
• Fill vacancies on the Board; and 
• Recommend nominees to the Board for election or re-election. 
[END TABLE]
 The following list represents the types of criteria the nominating committee takes into account when identifying and evaluating potential nominees:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Agricultural, business and financial background; 
• Accounting experience; 
• Community or civic involvement; 
• Independence from the Company (i.e. free from any family, material business or professional relationship with the Company); 
• Lack of potential conflicts of interest with the Company; 
• Examples or references that demonstrate a candidate's integrity, good judgment, commitment and willingness to consider matters with objectivity and impartiality; and 
• Specific needs of the existing board relative to any particular candidate so that the overall board composition reflects a mix of talents, experience, expertise and perspectives appropriate to the Company's circumstances. 
[END TABLE]
The nominating committee does not operate under a charter.  The nominating committee does not have a formalized policy related to diversity on the Board.  The nominating committee does not have a policy for receiving nominations for director positions from the Company's members.  The Company believes this is reasonable because the Operating Agreement provides a procedure for the members to nominate individuals to stand for election as directors.  The nominating committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  However, each member of the nominating committee is independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.
Nominations for the election of directors may be made by any member entitled to vote generally in the election of directors by following the procedures in the Company's Operating Agreement.  In accordance with the Company's Operating Agreement, a member desiring to nominate one or more persons for election as a director must provide the Company with written notice of such member's intent to make such nomination or nominations, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Company not less than 120 calendar days before the one year anniversary of the date when the Company's proxy statement was released to the members in connection with the previous year's annual meeting.  The deadline for the 2020 annual member meeting is September 6, 2019.    
The notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (a) the name and address of record of the member who intends to make the nomination; (b) a representation that the member is a holder of record of units of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation or employment of each nominee; (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the member and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the member; (e) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such member as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; (f) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected; and (g) a nominating petition signed and dated by the holders of at least five percent (5%) of the then outstanding membership units and clearly setting forth the proposed nominee as a candidate for the director's seat to be filled at the next election of directors. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company. The presiding officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.   
The Company solicited nominations for individuals to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting by sending out a  newsletter in September 2018 which was distributed to all members.  The Company received no proposed nominees other than the incumbent directors running for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  The nominating committee selected each incumbent nominees to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
Compensation Committees
Leslie Hansen (chairperson), Dave Sovereign and Steve Sukup serve on our executive compensation committee and  Marion Cagley, Jerry Calease, Duane Lynch (chairperson) and Dave Reinhart serve on our director compensation committee.  Each member of the executive compensation committee is independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.  Each member of the director compensation committee is independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.  The compensation committees do not operate under a charter.  Each of the compensation committees held one meeting for the 2018 fiscal year and each member of the compensation committee attended the meeting. For additional information on the responsibilities and activities of the compensation committees, including the process for determining executive compensation; see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
No family relationships currently exist between any of the directors, nominees, officers, or key employees of the Company.  
We have engaged in transactions with related parties.  The details of these transactions are discussed below. 
Chuck Schaffer
Chuck Schaffer manages a grain elevator from which the Company purchased corn and miscellaneous materials of approximately  $30,415,000 during our 2018 fiscal year.    Mr. Schaffer serves on our Risk Management Committee.  The Company believes that these purchases from the grain elevator were on terms no less favorable than the Company could have received from independent third parties.  Mr Schaffer's interest in the transactions cannot be determined without unreasonable expense.  
The Board reviews all transactions with related parties, as that term is defined by Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K, or any transaction in which related persons have an indirect interest.  The Company's Operating Agreement includes a written policy that requires that any such related transaction be made on terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the Company than if the transaction had been made with an independent third party.  Further, our Operating Agreement requires our directors to disclose any potential financial interest in any transaction being considered by the Board. 
Fagen, Inc. and Ron Fagen
Fagen, Inc. is a design build company from which the Company entered into a purchase agreement in the amount of approximately $7.3 million for additional fermentation capacity.  During our 2018 fiscal year payments were made on this contract of approximately $6,113,000.  Fagen Inc. and Ron Fagen have appointment rights to our board of directors.  
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
Throughout this proxy statement, the individuals who served as our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President/Commodity Manager are referred to as the "executive officers" or "executives."  The executive compensation committee does not operate under a charter. 
The executive compensation committee of the Board has responsibility for establishing, implementing and regularly monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives.  The executive compensation committee ensures that the total compensation paid to the executive officers is fair, reasonable and competitive.  Generally, the types of compensation and benefits provided to our principal executive officer are similar in form to the compensation and benefits provided to our other executive officers.
The executive compensation committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) establishes and administers a compensation policy for senior management; 
(2) reviews and approves the compensation policy for all or our employees other than senior management; 
(3) reviews and monitors our financial performance as it affects our compensation policies or the administration of those policies; 
(4) reviews and monitors our succession plans; 
(5) approves awards to employees pursuant to our incentive compensation plans; and 
(6) approves modifications in the employee benefit plans with respect to the benefits salaried employees receive under such plans. 
[END TABLE]
 All of the committee's actions are reported to the Board and, where appropriate, submitted to the Board for ratification.  The executive compensation committee meets with each of the executive officers to evaluate their performance and makes recommendations to the Board regarding the executive officers' compensation. 
In setting compensation, the executive compensation committee took into account the member vote at our 2017 annual member meeting called the "Say-on-Pay," where the Company's members overwhelming voted to endorse the Company's system of compensating its executive officers. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Our compensation programs are designed to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and talented executives who will contribute to the Company's success by reason of their ability, ingenuity and industry; 
• Link compensation realized to the achievement of the Company's short and long-term financial and strategic goals; 
• Align management and member interests by encouraging long-term member value creation; 
• Maximize the financial efficiency of the compensation program from tax, accounting, cash flow and dilution perspectives; and 
• Support important corporate governance principles and comply with best practices. 
[END TABLE]
To achieve these objectives, the executive compensation committee expects to implement and maintain compensation plans that tie a portion of the executives' overall compensation to the Company's financial performance. 
Executive Compensation Committee Procedures
The executive compensation committee of the Board is responsible for determining the nature and amount of compensation for the Company's executive officers.  In our 2018 fiscal year, the executive compensation committee consisted of three non-employee directors: Leslie Hansen (Chairperson), Steve Sukup and Dave Sovereign.
The executive compensation committee solicits input from the executive officers regarding their personal performance achievements and performs an annual evaluation of the executive officers which is shared with the Board.  This individual performance assessment determines a portion of the annual compensation for each executive officer. 
In determining the long-term incentive component of the executive officers' compensation, the executive compensation committee will consider all relevant factors, including the Company's performance, the value of similar awards to executive officers of comparable companies, and the awards given to the executive officers in past years.  The executive officers are not present at either executive compensation committee or Board level deliberations concerning their compensation.
From time to time, the executive compensation committee may delegate to the Executive Vice-President the authority to implement certain decisions of the committee or to fulfill administrative duties.
Compensation Components
Base Salary
Base salaries for our executive officers are established based on the scope of their roles, responsibilities, experience levels and performance, and taking into account competitive market compensation paid by comparable companies for similar positions.  Base salaries are reviewed approximately annually, and may be adjusted from time to time to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual performance and experience. Net Income Bonus
2018 Executive Bonus Plan
During the Company's 2015 fiscal year, it established a new Executive Compensation Plan.  In addition to the base salaries, the Board approved a cash bonus payable for our 2018 fiscal year to our Executive Vice President/Commodity Manager,  Curt Strong, our Chief Financial Officer, Christine Marchand, and our Chief Operating Officer, Chad Kuhlers, shared equally among our three executives.  The amount of the bonus is 1% of our net income for the fiscal year as determined by our audited financial statements.  The Company believes that the net income bonus is reasonable as it ties the bonus paid to the executive officers to the financial success of the Company and is easily quantified by the Company.
For our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Company had net income of approximately $6.4 million and a bonus payment of approximately $64,000. For our fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company had net income of approximately $29.4 million and a bonus payment of approximately $297,000.   For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the net income bonus was paid in cash shortly following our fiscal year end.   
Benefits and Perquisites
We do not provide any material executive perquisites.  We have no supplemental retirement plans or pension plans and we have no intention of implementing any such plans in our 2019 fiscal year.
No Pension Benefit Plan, Change of Control or Severance Agreements
We offer no pension benefit plans to our executive officers.  Our executive officers do not have change of control or severance agreements, which means the Board retains discretion over severance arrangements if it decides to terminate their employment.  However, if we were to experience a change in control, any un-vested phantom unit awards would immediately vest.    
Accounting and Tax Treatment of Awards
None of our executive officers, directors, or employees receives compensation in excess of $1,000,000 and therefore the entire amount of their compensation is deductible by the Company as a business expense. Certain large executive compensation awards are not tax deductible by companies making such awards. None of our compensation arrangements are likely to reach this level in the foreseeable future.
Executive Compensation Committee Report
The executive compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.  Based upon this review and discussion, the executive compensation committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the members of the executive compensation committee is or has been an employee of the Company.  There are no interlocking relationships between the Company and other entities that might affect the determination of the compensation of our executive officers.
Summary Compensation Table
The following table sets forth all compensation paid or payable by the Company during the last three fiscal years to our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President/Commodity Manager.  As of October 31, 2018, none of our directors or executive officers had any options, warrants, or other similar rights to purchase securities of the Company.
