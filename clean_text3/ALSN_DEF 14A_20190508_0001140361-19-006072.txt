 Lieutenant General, United States Air Force (retired) Reynolds, age 70, is owner and principal of the VanFleet Group, LLC, an aerospace consulting company, and has served in that capacity since 2005. Prior to his retirement in 2005, General Reynolds was Vice Commander, Air Force Materiel Command. During his 34 years of active duty Air Force service, he commanded the Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. He was also Program Executive Officer, Airlift and Trainers in the Pentagon, and Program Director for several major weapon system acquisitions, including the B-2 Spirit. General Reynolds is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, Class 79B, and has more than 25 years of hands-on experience in the research, development, program management, test and evaluation of aeronautical systems. He holds Federal Aviation Administration certificates for Airline Transport Pilot and Flight Instructor (Glider), and his logbook shows more than 4,000 flying hours in 72 different military and civil aircraft. Graduating in 1971 from the U.S. Air Force Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering, General Reynolds has a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from California State University, and a Master of Arts degree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College.
