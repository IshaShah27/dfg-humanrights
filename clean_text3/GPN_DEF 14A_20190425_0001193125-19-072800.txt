Shareholder Outreach (Page 27) 
We believe in providing transparent and timely information to our investors. Each year we routinely engage shareholders and analysts in various forums, which may include industry conferences, road-shows, meetings at our offices or at our shareholders' offices, conference calls and investor day events. Throughout the year, we held meetings with many of our top institutional investors. In our meetings, we discussed a variety of topics that are important to investors, including industry trends, corporate governance, Company performance and operations and short and long-term strategic direction. We hosted our 2018 investor day on March 1, 2018, which provided an opportunity for shareholders and analysts to hear directly from management on the Company's long-term strategy and ask questions of the management team. In 2018, we again engaged directly across the spectrum of our active shareholder base on the Company's performance, operations and strategic direction. 
Recent Corporate Governance Developments

Diversity and Inclusion 
Our Company has always prided itself on inclusiveness and embraces the diversity of its employees in all of our geographies. We currently do business in nearly 60 countries around the world, with employees living and working in 32 of them. We have always believed, and continue to believe, that our business is strengthened by a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate. 
In 2018, we built on our history of diversity and inclusion by formally launching a diversity and inclusion initiative. As part of this initiative, we became a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion™, which is the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 
In 2018, we also: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• established a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, which is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and will consist of  a representative group of our employees worldwide who will provide insight and input on our diversity and inclusion initiatives, including our strategy to increase representation of women and minorities at leadership levels in the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued to support our women's employee resource group which implements diversity initiatives related to women,  including networking and training opportunities, and also recently launched a LGBTQ+ employee resource group, to be chaired by our General Counsel;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• committed to providing unconscious bias training beginning in 2019 to all of our executives and managers, recognizing that  all employees have unconscious biases which may impact how they make decisions about and interact with other employees; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• developed a career website and job postings which seek to attract and recruit employees of diverse characteristics and  backgrounds by highlighting our commitment to diversity and inclusion.  
[END TABLE]
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 5 
In addition to the above initiatives, we augmented the existing diversity and inclusion components of our talent management program to ensure that diversity and inclusion is integrated into every aspect of our programs including talent acquisition, performance management, leadership training and development, and succession planning. 
We will continue to measure our progress to ensure our initiatives and programs continue to support our diversity and inclusion goals.

      Annual Cash Incentives     Our annual performance plan rewards short-term Company performance, while aligning the interests of our NEOs with those of our  shareholders. For 2018, awards under our annual performance plan were determined based on specified goals for adjusted EPS, adjusted net revenue plus network fees and adjusted operating margin, which are  non-GAAP financial measures and are described on Appendix A to this proxy statement.          40  
        Performance Units       Performance units are performance-based restricted stock units that, after a  three-year performance period, may convert into a number of unrestricted shares depending on the average of the growth of our annual adjusted EPS for each of the three years in the performance period.   In 2018, the Compensation Committee modified the performance units' structure to enhance the  alignment between executive rewards and long-term gains for the Company and its shareholders by tying the achievement of the NEOs' compensation to both business objectives and shareholder return.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee modified the performance units' structure to enhance the  alignment between executive rewards and long-term gains for the Company and its shareholders by tying the achievement of the NEOs' compensation to both business objectives and shareholder return.

Questions and Answers About Our Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement 
1. Why did I receive these materials? 
This proxy statement is being furnished to solicit proxies on behalf of the board of directors of our Company for use at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. The annual meeting will be held at our offices at 3550 Lenox Road, Atlanta, Georgia, 30326 on Thursday, April 25, 2019 at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time. 
2. What am I voting on and how does the board of directors recommend that I vote? 
Our board of directors recommends that you vote FOR each of the following three proposals scheduled to be voted on at the meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1:    Election of the two directors nominated by our  board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2:    Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation  of the NEOs for 2018. This proposal is referred to as the "say-on-pay" proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3:    Ratification of the reappointment of Deloitte as our  independent public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
3. Could other matters be decided at the annual meeting? 
Yes. The shareholders may transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. If any other matter properly comes before the meeting and you have submitted your proxy, the proxy holders will vote as recommended by the board or, if no recommendation is made, in their own discretion. 
4. Why did I receive a mailed notice of internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
As permitted by the SEC, we are making this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K available to our shareholders electronically via the internet. The notice contains instructions on how to access this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K and how to vote online or submit your proxy over the internet or by telephone. You will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you request one, which you may do by following the instructions contained in the notice. We encourage you to take advantage of the electronic availability of proxy materials to help reduce the cost and environmental impact of the annual meeting. 
5. How do I vote? 
If you received a notice of electronic availability, that notice provides instructions on how to vote by internet, by telephone or by requesting and returning a paper proxy card. You may submit your proxy voting instructions via the internet or telephone by following the instructions provided in the notice. The internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate your identity, to allow you to vote your shares, and to confirm that your voting instructions are properly recorded. If your shares are held in the name of a bank or a broker, the availability of internet and telephone voting will depend on the voting processes of the bank or broker. Therefore, we recommend that you follow the instructions on the form you receive. If you received a printed version of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by following the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card. 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 9 
6. What if I change my mind after I vote? 
Your submission of a proxy via the internet, by telephone or by mail does not affect your right to attend the annual meeting in person. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised in any of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deliver written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at 3550 Lenox Road, Suite 3000, Atlanta, Georgia 30326, or  submit to us a duly executed proxy card bearing a later date. To be effective, your notice of revocation or new proxy card must be received by our Corporate Secretary, David L. Green, at or before the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change your vote via the internet or by telephone at a later date. To be effective, your vote must be received before 11:59  p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on April 24, 2019, the day before the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appear at the annual meeting and vote in person, regardless of whether you previously submitted a notice of revocation.   
[END TABLE]
7. Who is entitled to vote? 
All shareholders who owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on March 4, 2019 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. On that date, there were 157,850,344 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 2,089 shareholders of record. Shareholders are entitled to one vote per share. 
8. How many votes must be present to hold the annual meeting? 
In order for any business to be conducted, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting must be present, either in person or by proxy. This is referred to as a "quorum." Abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) will be treated as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the annual meeting may be adjourned by the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the annual meeting. The annual meeting may be rescheduled at the time of the adjournment with no further notice of the reconvened meeting if the date, time and place of the reconvened meeting are announced at the adjourned meeting before its adjournment; provided, however, that if a new record date is or must be fixed, notice of the reconvened meeting must be given to the shareholders of record as of the new record date. An adjournment will have no effect on the business to be conducted at the meeting. 
9. What are the voting standards for the proposals? 
Each of the three scheduled proposals must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. This means that a proposal is approved if the number of shares voted "for" the proposal exceeds the number of shares voted "against" the proposal. 
10. What is the difference between a "shareholder of record" and a "beneficial owner of shares held in street name?" 
Shareholders of record.    If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and we sent the notice of electronic availability directly to you. If you request copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a proxy card. 
Beneficial owners of shares held in street name.    If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the notice of electronic availability was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you request copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form. 
10 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
11. What happens if I do not return a proxy or do not give specific voting instructions? 
Shareholders of record.    If you are a shareholder of record and you do not vote via the internet, by telephone or by mail, your shares will not be voted unless you attend the annual meeting to vote them in person. If you are a shareholder of record and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by the board of directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the annual meeting. 
Beneficial owners of shares held in street name.    If you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your broker will have the discretionary authority to vote your shares only on proposals that are considered "routine." The only proposal at the annual meeting that is considered routine is the ratification of the reappointment of our independent auditor. All of the other proposals are considered "non-routine," which means that your broker will not have the discretionary authority to vote your shares with respect to such proposals. Shares for which you do not provide voting instructions and a broker lacks discretionary voting authority are referred to as "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum, but whether they are counted for purpose of voting on proposals depends on the voting standard for the particular proposal. Since each of the scheduled proposals requires approval by a majority of votes cast, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes "for" or "against" the proposal. As a result, although abstentions and broker non-votes may be counted for the purpose of establishing a quorum for the meeting, they have no effect on the voting results. 
12. What should I do if I receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card? 
Shareholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of the notice of electronic availability, these proxy materials and proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, shareholders who hold shares in more than one brokerage account may receive separate notices for each brokerage account in which shares are held. Shareholders of record whose shares are registered in more than one name will receive more than one notice. You should vote in accordance with all of the notices you receive to ensure that all of your shares are counted. 
13. Who pays the cost of proxy solicitation? 
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by us. However, shareholders voting electronically (via phone or the internet) should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from internet service providers or telephone companies. In addition to solicitation of shareholders of record by mail, telephone or personal contact, arrangements will be made with brokerage houses to furnish proxy materials to their principals, and we may reimburse them for mailing expenses. Custodians and fiduciaries will be supplied with proxy materials to forward to beneficial owners of common stock. 
14. May I propose actions for consideration at next year's annual shareholder meeting? 
Proposals for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement (Rule 14a-8):    SEC rules permit shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement if the shareholder and the proposal meet the requirements specified in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. Proposals submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 annual shareholder meeting must be received by our Corporate Secretary no earlier than October 15, 2019 and no later than November 14, 2019, which is 120 days before the one year anniversary of the mailing of this proxy statement. 
Director Nominees for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement (Proxy Access):    Our bylaws permit a shareholder (or a group of no more than 20 shareholders) owning 3% or more of our common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate up to an aggregate limit of two candidates or 20% of our board (whichever is greater) for inclusion in our proxy statement. Notice of such nominees must be received no earlier than October 15, 2019 and no later than close of business on November 14, 2019. 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 11 
Other Business Proposals/Director Nominees:    Our bylaws also set forth the procedures that a shareholder must follow to nominate a candidate for election as a director or to propose other business for consideration at shareholder meetings, in each case, not submitted for inclusion in next year's proxy statement (either under proxy access or Rule 14a-8), but instead to be presented directly at shareholder meetings. In each case, director nominations or proposals for other business for consideration at the 2020 annual shareholder meeting submitted under these bylaw provisions must be received by our Corporate Secretary between October 15, 2019 and November 14, 2019. Special notice provisions apply under the bylaws if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary date. 
Our Corporate Secretary address is: 3550 Lenox Road, Suite 3000, Atlanta, GA 30326. Notice must include the information required by our bylaws, which are available without charge upon written request to our Corporate Secretary. 
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Exchange Act and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein are generally identified by the words "believe," "project," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "future," "opportunity," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," "committed," "ensure," or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required by law. 
12 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Proposal One: Election of Directors 
Our board of directors, upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, has nominated directors Mitchell L. Hollin and Ruth Ann Marshall, each a Class I director, to be elected to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each nominee has agreed to serve as a director if elected. For information on the factors the board considers when evaluating candidates for nomination, see "Board and Corporate Governance — Board Membership Criteria" on page 20. 
Our board of directors currently consists of nine members who are divided into three classes, with the term of office of each class ending in successive years. Each class of directors serves staggered three-year terms. Of the Class I directors, the board has determined to nominate only Mr. Hollin and Ms. Marshall for re-election at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. At the annual meeting, proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of individuals than the two nominees named in this proxy statement. 
The Company has a majority voting standard to elect directors in uncontested elections of directors, such as this election. Under the majority voting standard, if the votes cast "against" a director exceed the number of votes cast "for" the director, the director is not elected. Under Georgia law, to ensure that a board's power to act continues uninterrupted, the failure to receive the required number of votes for re-election would not automatically result in a vacancy. Instead, the director who failed to receive the required number of votes would continue to serve as director until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or death. Such a director is referred to as a "holdover" director. If one of the Company's directors fails to receive the required number of votes for reelection, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require the director to promptly tender his or her written resignation to the board following certification of the shareholder vote. If the tendered resignation does not expressly require acceptance by the board, the resignation will become effective immediately, or on the date set forth in the resignation, and there will be a vacancy on the board upon the effective date of the resignation. If the tendered resignation specifies that it is not effective until accepted by the board, the board has the discretion to accept or reject the resignation. In such a case, the Governance and Nominating Committee will promptly consider the tendered resignation and, based on any factors deemed relevant by the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee, recommend to the board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. 
In considering the Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, the board may consider any factors deemed relevant by the members of the board. If the board does not accept the resignation, the director will continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or death. The Company will publicly disclose the board's decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. To the extent that one or more directors' resignations are accepted by the board, the Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend to the board whether to fill such vacancy or vacancies or to reduce the size of the board. 
The composition of our board of directors is currently as follows:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Our board of directors has determined that this director is independent.  
[END TABLE]
In each case, the director nominee, if elected, will serve a shorter term in the event of his or her resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal from office or death. In the event that any of the nominees is unable to serve (which is not anticipated), the persons designated as proxies will cast votes for such other person(s) as they may select. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director nominee at the annual meeting at which a quorum is present is required for the election of each of the nominees. If a choice is specified on the proxy card by a shareholder, the shares will be voted as specified. If no specification is made, the shares will be voted "FOR" each of the two nominees. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 
"FOR" THE ELECTION OF ALL OF THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR.

Board and Corporate Governance 
Board Leadership 
Our board of directors is chaired by Mr. Jacobs, one of our independent directors. Our board believes that Mr. Jacobs' service as Chairman enhances the independent oversight of management, while continuing to provide the decisive leadership necessary for an effective Chairman. From his 18-year tenure as a member of our board and 16-year tenure as either Chairman of the board or lead director, Mr. Jacobs has acquired a deep knowledge of our history and culture as well as the issues, opportunities and challenges facing our business. As a result, our board believes that Mr. Jacobs is well-positioned to ensure that the board's time and attention is focused on the most critical matters. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not express a formal policy on whether the same person should serve as the Chairman of the board and the Chief Executive Officer. Although our Chairman of the board is an independent director, if in the future a non-independent director serves as Chairman of the board, the board will appoint a lead director to fulfill many of the responsibilities of the Chairman listed below. 
Chairman of the Board Duties 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Presides at all meetings of the board (including all executive sessions);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Serves as the liaison between the Chief Executive Officer and the independent and  non-employee directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Establishes the agenda and presides at executive sessions of the independent and  non-employee directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Generally approves information provided to the board, board meeting agendas and meeting schedules to ensure there is  sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    In conjunction with the Compensation Committee, reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the Chief  Executive Officers compensation, evaluates the Chief Executive Officers performance in light of those goals and objectives, determines and approves the Chief Executive Officers compensation based upon such evaluation, and  communicates with the Chief Executive Officer regarding the foregoing.  
[END TABLE]
Board Independence 
At least a majority of our directors, and all of the members of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee, must be "independent" based on the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE. Each year, our board of directors reviews the independence of our directors and considers, among other things, relationships and transactions during the past three years between each director or any member of his or her immediate family, on the one hand, and our Company and our subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand. 
The purpose of the review is to determine whether any such relationships or transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent as defined under the NYSE listing standards. 
The NYSE listing standards provide that to qualify as an "independent" director, in addition to satisfying certain bright-line criteria, our board of directors must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with our Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company). Additional independence requirements established by the SEC and the NYSE apply to members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. 
Using these standards for determining the independence of its members, the board determined that the following directors are independent: 
In addition, each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee is independent. 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 19 
Board Membership Criteria 
Our board currently consists of nine directors divided into three equal classes, who each serve a three-year term. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee believes that diversity is an important factor in determining the composition of the board and considers it in making nominee recommendations, although it does not have a formal diversity policy. The Governance and Nominating Committee considers candidates for director who are recommended by other members of the board of directors and by management, as well as those identified by any outside consultants who are periodically retained by the committee to assist in identifying possible candidates. The committee will evaluate potential nominees for open board positions suggested by shareholders in accordance with our policies for shareholder proposals and on the same basis as all other potential nominees. See "Questions and Answers About Our Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement — May I Propose Actions for Consideration at Next Year's Annual Shareholder Meeting?" for additional information about our policies for shareholder proposals. 
Key factors the Governance and Nominating Committee considers when determining whether to appoint directors include:

The board has identified the following key qualifications and experience that are important to be represented on our board as a whole in light of our current business strategy and expected needs. The charts below indicate how these qualifications are represented on our board based on information provided by our directors. Information regarding each director's skills and qualifications can be found within their individual biographies on pages 14-18.

Board Refreshment 
We periodically review our board's composition to ensure that we continue to have the right mix of skills, background and tenure. The board currently believes that an appropriate size is seven to twelve members, allowing, however, for changing circumstances that may warrant a higher or a lower number. The Governance and Nominating Committee considers director candidates suggested by members of the committee, other directors, shareholders and management, and has engaged the services of third party firms to assist in identifying and evaluating director candidates. 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 21 
As a result of healthy refreshment over recent years, as of the date of this proxy statement, 50% of our non-employee board members have joined the board in the last five years, and 38% joined the board in the last three years. The background and skills of these directors contribute meaningfully to the Company's strategy for future growth and long-term value creation. 
In addition, we amended our bylaws in May 2017 to permit a shareholder (or a group of up to 20 shareholders) who has owned at least 3% of our stock continuously for at least three years to submit director nominees for the greater of two individuals or 20% of the board for inclusion in our proxy statement if the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) meet the requirements of the bylaws. 
The board also believes that directors develop an understanding of the Company and an ability to work effectively as a group over time that provides substantial value, and therefore a significant degree of continuity year-over-year is beneficial to shareholders and generally should be expected. 
The current tenure, independence and diversity composition of our board is as follows: 
Board and Committee Membership — Director Attendance at Meetings 
Our full board of directors met five times during 2018. All of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the board during 2018, including meetings of the committees of which they were members. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, all of our directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders, and all of our directors attended the 2018 annual meeting. 
Our board of directors has established five standing committees, which include the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Risk Oversight Committee and the Technology Committee, all of which are comprised exclusively of non-employee directors. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance and Nominating Committee are comprised exclusively of independent non-employee directors. 
22 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Our board has adopted written charters for each of these committees. Each committee charter and our corporate governance guidelines are available in the investor relations section of our website, www.globalpaymentsinc.com.

Board Oversight of Risk Management 
Our board of directors views the oversight of risk management as one of its key functions, regularly engaging with management to maintain a risk-aware culture where risk management is deeply and pervasively embedded in all of our activities worldwide. Through its oversight of our enterprise risk management program, our board takes a multi-layered approach to this oversight role. The full board engages directly with management to set high level policy. At least annually, the board discusses with management the appropriate level of risk relative to our strategy and objectives and reviews with management our existing risk management processes and their effectiveness. In addition, the board receives periodic reports on risk management activities from each committee chair while relying on each of its five standing committees to provide more in-depth oversight of specific key risk exposures. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our board has delegated to the Risk Oversight Committee the responsibility to directly oversee our enterprise risk management program. Specifically, subject to oversight by the full board of directors, the Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for overseeing the process for identifying, assessing and managing the key risks our Company faces, receiving recommendations from management with respect to such risks, and making recommendations to the full board of directors. The committee's responsibilities related to oversight of the enterprise risk management program are process-oriented, meaning the committee takes steps to ensure that an effective process is in place to identify and manage key risk exposures, develop a risk mitigation plan and ensure proper reporting on compliance with such plan. 
Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, we established a management risk committee comprised primarily of executive management that is responsible for identifying, assessing, prioritizing and developing action plans to mitigate key risks. The management risk committee reports to the full board or appropriate board committee periodically and more frequently as needed. 
Risk oversight responsibilities related to the substance of each identified key risk exposure, such as the application of the board's risk tolerance in a particular area, are in some cases carried out by the full board without any delegation to a committee. For example, the full board directly oversees our risk management 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 25 
 activities with respect to risks associated with our strategic direction. More frequently, oversight of defined risk exposures is carried out by the board committee with the most relevant subject-matter expertise. In these cases, the relevant board committee carries out these responsibilities utilizing the process established by the Risk Oversight Committee, with reporting obligations to the full board. Our board has delegated risk oversight responsibilities for certain key risk exposures to its committees as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee.    The Audit Committee oversees our risk  management activities with respect to our financial reporting and disclosure obligations as well as our financial management and liquidity risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Committee.    The Compensation Committee oversees our  risk management activities with respect to our compensation policies and practices for our NEOs and all other employees, specifically to ensure that our policies and practices promote appropriate approaches to risk management. The Compensation  Committee also oversees and recommends to the full board for approval our management succession plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Governance and Nominating Committee.    The Governance and  Nominating Committee oversees our risk management activities with respect to our corporate governance structure at the board and senior management level. At the board level, functions of the Governance and Nominating Committee are intended to ensure  that our full board and its other committees continue to operate functionally and with an appropriate degree of independence from management. At the senior management level, the Governance and Nominating Committee promotes a risk-aware culture by,  for example, periodically reviewing our employee business code of conduct and ethics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Risk Oversight Committee.    In addition to the process-oriented  risk management activities outlined above, the Risk Oversight Committee directly oversees our risk management activities with respect to enterprise risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery, regulatory and industry compliance,  geopolitical risk and privacy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Technology Committee.    The Technology Committee oversees our risk  management activities with respect to information security and cyber-security and our technological infrastructure.  
[END TABLE]
The Board's Role in Overseeing Cyber Risk 
We employ multiple methods and technologies to secure the Company's computing environment and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information assets. As noted above, technology and cyber-security qualifications and experience is one of the key factors that our Governance and Nominating Committee considers in its assessment of the board membership criteria. 
Our board has delegated to the Technology Committee the responsibility to oversee the Company's Information Security Program and cyber-security risk. Specifically, subject to oversight by the full board of directors, the Technology Committee periodically receives reports from the Company's Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO, on the Company's cyber risk profile and information security initiatives. The Company's Information Security Program is administered by the CISO, who maintains a direct reporting line to both the Technology Committee and the board. At least annually, the Technology Committee receives a formal, enterprise-wide information technology and cyber-security risk assessment and reviews and recommends the Company's information security program supporting policies to the full board for evaluation and approval. The Technology Committee regularly reviews and discusses the Company's technology strategy with the Chief Information Officer and recommends the Company's technology strategic plan to the full board for evaluation and approval. 
In addition, the board and the Risk Committee regularly receive information about these topics from the Chair of the Technology Committee, the CISO and management and are apprised directly of incidents exceeding certain risk tolerances. 
26 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Evaluation of Board and Committee Effectiveness 
Each year, our board and its committees conduct self-evaluations to ensure they are performing effectively and to identify opportunities to improve board and committee performance. The written self-assessment is conducted under the oversight of the Governance and Nominating Committee. Anonymous evaluation responses are reviewed and assessed during board and committee executive sessions and where appropriate, addressed with management. As part of the board's self-assessment process, directors consider various topics related to board composition, structure, effectiveness and responsibilities, as well as the overall mix of director skills, experience, diversity and backgrounds. 
Shareholder Outreach 
The Company values the input and insights of its shareholders and is committed to continued engagement on a wide variety of topics that are important to investors. Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, routinely provide information to and receive feedback from our investors in a wide variety of formats, including in our quarterly SEC filings, quarterly earnings conference calls, our Annual Report and proxy statement, regular investor conferences and road-shows, and meetings with individual investors. We have a staff of professionals in our Investor Relations department who are dedicated full time to respond to questions from shareholders and other investors about the Company and its performance. 
We hosted our 2018 investor day on March 1, 2018, which provided an opportunity for shareholders and analysts to hear directly from management on the Company's long-term strategy and ask questions of the management team. In 2018, we again engaged directly across the spectrum of our active shareholder base on the Company's performance, operations and strategic direction. 
In 2017, after thoughtful discussions with shareholders and considering the viewpoints of governance experts and advisors, we adopted a bylaw allowing shareholders to nominate directors and to have such nominees included in the proxy statement. Consistent with market practice and many other S&P 500 companies, our bylaws now permit a shareholder or a group of up to twenty shareholders owning three percent or more of the Company's voting stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials for an annual meeting of shareholders director candidates constituting up to the greater of two directors or 20% of the board; provided that the shareholder (or group) and each nominee satisfy the requirements for proxy access as specified in the bylaws. We believe these parameters balance the benefit to our shareholders with the challenges related to possible proxy contests, turnover in board seats and the challenges of integrating new qualified directors. 
Director Compensation 
Our non-employee director compensation plan is designed to attract, retain and compensate highly-qualified directors by providing them with competitive compensation and an equity interest in our Company to align their interests with those of our shareholders. In lieu of per-meeting fees, we pay our non-employee directors annual cash and stock retainers, which are payable in advance on the first business day after each annual meeting of shareholders (prorated for partial periods for new directors). We do not pay additional compensation to directors who are also our employees for their service as a director. 
Our Governance and Nominating Committee periodically reviews our non-employee director compensation plan and makes recommendations as necessary to our full board of directors. The annual cash and stock retainers we pay our non-employee directors are as set forth below:

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
The non-employee directors are eligible to participate in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, or the deferred compensation plan. Ms. Marshall and Mr. Silberstein are the only two directors who participated in the deferred compensation plan during 2018. Pursuant to the deferred compensation plan, non-employee directors are permitted to elect to defer up to 100% of their annual cash retainer. Participant accounts are credited with earnings based on the participant's investment allocation among a menu of investment options selected by the deferred compensation plan administrator. Participants are 100% vested in the participant deferrals and related earnings. We do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and do not guarantee any return on participant account balances. Participants may allocate their plan accounts into sub-accounts that are payable upon separation from service or on designated specified dates. Except in the case of death or disability, participants may elect in advance to have their various account balances pay out in a single lump sum or in installments over a period of two to ten years. In the event a participant separates from service by reason of death or disability, the participant or his or her designated beneficiary will receive the undistributed portion of his or her account balances in a lump-sum payment. Subject to approval by the deferred compensation plan administrator, in the event of an unforeseen financial emergency beyond the participant's control, a participant may request a withdrawal from an account up to the amount necessary to satisfy the emergency (provided the participant does not have the financial resources to otherwise meet the hardship). 
Target Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our board of directors has implemented stock ownership guidelines for our directors in order to foster equity ownership and align the interests of our directors with our shareholders. Within five years of becoming a director, each director is expected to beneficially own a number of shares of our common stock at least equal in value to 500% of the director's annual cash retainer. 
Contacting Our Board of Directors 
Any interested party may contact any individual director, our non-employee or independent directors as a group, or all of our directors by directing such communications to the applicable directors in care of the Corporate Secretary at our address at 3550 Lenox Road, Suite 3000, Atlanta, Georgia 30326. Any correspondence received by the Corporate Secretary in accordance with the foregoing will be forwarded to the applicable director or directors.

Proposal Two: Advisory Vote to Approve the 2018 Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, our board of directors is asking shareholders to approve an advisory resolution on executive compensation. The advisory vote is a non-binding vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs in 2018. The vote, which is known as a "say-on-pay" vote, is intended to give our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. The vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. At last year's annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 98% of the votes cast were cast in support of the compensation of our NEOs. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Resolved, that the Company's shareholders APPROVE, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the summary compensation table and related compensation tables and narrative discussion. 
We urge you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this proxy statement, which discusses how our compensation policies and procedures implement our compensation philosophy. You should also read the summary compensation table and other related compensation tables and narrative disclosure which provide additional details about the compensation of our NEOs in 2018. We have designed our compensation and benefits program and philosophy to attract, retain and motivate talented, qualified and committed executive officers who share our philosophy and desire to work toward our goals. We believe that for 2018, our executive compensation program aligned individual compensation with the short-term and long-term performance of our Company in ways such as the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay opportunities were appropriate to the size of our Company when compared to peer companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation program was heavily performance-based, using multiple measures for short-term incentives.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance metrics under our short-term incentive plan are adjusted to reflect acquisitions that we make during the year.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentives were linked to shareholder value through performance units, stock options and time-based restricted  stock that change in value as share price fluctuates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance units will result in an either increased or decreased payout multiple based on our total shareholder return  performance rank relative to the S&P 500 index.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Perquisites are a minor part of our compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Excise tax gross-ups are not provided to any of our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our insider trading policy prohibits directors and employees from engaging in any transaction in which they profit if the  value of our common stock falls.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pursuant to our clawback policy, we may recoup the value of any annual or long-term incentive awards provided to any NEOs  in the event that our financial statements are restated due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change-in-control severance provisions in  employment agreements are double trigger.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee engages independent compensation consultants.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee certifies performance results for purposes of executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We do not re-price or backdate stock options or issue discounted stock options.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We do not pay dividend equivalent rights with respect to restricted stock units.  
[END TABLE]
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 33 
The vote regarding the compensation of the NEOs described in this Proposal No. 2 is advisory, and therefore, is not binding on us or our board. Although non-binding, our board values the opinions that shareholders express in their votes and will review the voting results and take them into consideration as it deems appropriate when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation programs. Our board of directors has adopted a policy providing for an annual say-on-pay vote. Unless our board of directors modifies this policy, the next say-on-pay vote will be held at our next annual shareholder meeting in 2020. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE 
"FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE 2018 COMPENSATION OF OUR 
NEOs, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

Our stock price from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018 relative to the performance of our peer group and the S&P 500  index, which we joined in April 2016, is shown in the graph below.

The following graph compares the cumulative shareholder returns of $100 invested in the S&P 500 Index, our Company and the average of our performance peer group from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018, assuming reinvestment of dividends. 
The graph excludes peer group performance for PayPal, Inc. and First Data Corp., because these companies were not publicly traded for the full period presented above.

As illustrated above, with the exception of base salary and time-based restricted stock awards, all target compensation is performance-based. NEOs are also subject to stock ownership guidelines, and the securities they are required to hold under those guidelines will continue to fluctuate with our share price. 
2018 Compensation Highlights 
The short-term cash incentives awarded under our annual performance plan incent and reward our NEOs for achievement of short-term goals aligned with our 2018 operating plan. The long-term incentive plan incents and rewards our NEOs for achievement of long-term goals measured over a multi-year period. Together, these plans support our strategy of facilitating the adoption of, and transition to, card, electronic and digital-based payments by expanding our share in existing markets through our distribution channels, new products and services and acquisitions to improve our scale of offerings, while simultaneously seeking expansion into new markets through acquisitions around the world. 
Short-Term Cash Incentives 
The short-term cash incentives awarded under our annual performance plan are 100% based on achievement of Company performance goals, equally weighted among adjusted earnings per share, which we refer to as adjusted EPS, adjusted net revenue plus network fees and adjusted operating margin. For 2018, each of our NEOs earned 129% of his target under the annual performance plan. These performance goals are discussed below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Short-Term Incentive Plan" beginning on page 40. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards 
The Compensation Committee grants equity-based compensation to our NEOs to provide long-term incentives and align management and shareholder interests. 
Performance Units.    Awards under our long-term incentive plan include performance-based restricted stock units, which we refer to as "performance units," stock options and time-based restricted stock. For 2018, the Compensation Committee, after consultation with its independent compensation consultant, Frederick W. Cook & Co., or FWC, modified the design under which performance units are earned to enhance the alignment between executive rewards and long-term gains for the Company and its shareholders by tying the achievement of the NEOs' compensation to both business objectives and shareholder return. Under the new design, 
36 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement performance units are earned based on the achievement of an annual adjusted EPS growth target each year averaged over a three-year performance period, modified up or down by the Company's total shareholder return performance rank relative to the S&P 500 index, or the TSR modifier, over the three-year performance period. The maximum possible payout is four times the target number of the performance units and the minimum payout is zero. To the extent earned, performance units convert into unrestricted shares after performance results for the three-year performance period are certified by the Compensation Committee. 
Stock Options and Restricted Stock.    Stock options and restricted stock vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the respective grant dates. The value of each of the long-term incentive awards changes as our share price changes, thereby aligning the interests of our NEOs with those of our shareholders. Awards under our long-term incentive plan for 2018 are discussed below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Long-Term Incentive Plan" beginning on page 42.

How Compensation Decisions Are Made 
Objectives of Compensation Policies 
Our Compensation Committee designs and at least annually reviews our compensation program with a view to retaining and attracting executive leadership of a caliber and level of experience necessary to manage our complex, growth-oriented and global businesses. Our objective is to maintain a compensation program that will allow us to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• support the financial and business objectives of our organization;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• create an environment where performance is expected and rewarded;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• deliver an externally competitive and transparent total compensation structure; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of our NEOs with our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
In order to achieve these results, our Compensation Committee believes our program must: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide our NEOs with total compensation opportunities at levels that are competitive for comparable positions in a highly  competitive industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide variable, at-risk incentive award opportunities that are payable only if  specific goals are achieved;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide significant upside opportunities for outstanding performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align our NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders by making stock-based incentives a core element of our  NEOs' compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 37 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• protect our competitive position by prohibiting our NEOs from competing with our Company for a specified period of time  following termination of employment.  
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee also considers and assesses potential risk and risk mitigation factors in our compensation program. For 2018, our Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation practices are balanced, do not encourage excessive risk taking by our NEOs, and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
Our Compensation Committee retained FWC as its independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of FWC and whether its work raised any conflict of interest, taking into consideration the independence factors set forth in applicable SEC and NYSE rules, and determined that FWC is independent. FWC took guidance from and reported directly to the Compensation Committee. FWC advised the Compensation Committee on current and future trends and issues in executive compensation and on the competitiveness of the compensation structure and levels of our NEOs during 2018. At the request of the Compensation Committee and to provide context for the Compensation Committee's compensation decisions made for 2018, FWC performed the following services: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Conducted a market review and analysis for our NEOs to determine whether their total targeted compensation opportunities  were competitive with positions of a similar scope in similarly sized companies in similar industries;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prepared tally sheets on our NEOs to allow the Compensation Committee to review the reasonableness of the total wealth  accumulated during each executive's tenure with our Company and to show the impact on our Company in the event of a termination of employment; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attended Compensation Committee meetings, as requested by the committee, to discuss these items.  
[END TABLE]
All services performed for us by FWC during 2018 were related to executive and non-employee director compensation. 
Market Data 
Our Compensation Committee considers the compensation programs and practices and resulting NEO compensation opportunities and levels of selected other companies to assist it in setting our NEOs' compensation to ensure that it remains competitive. For 2018, our peer group remained the same as the peer group selected in 2017. The companies in the peer group were chosen because (i) each company in the peer group is in the transaction processing or data services business; (ii) each company in the peer group is publicly traded; (iii) at the time the peer group was constructed, our revenues were near the median of the group as a whole; and (iv) we compete for talent with many of these companies. 
For 2018, our peer group included the following companies:

In connection with the Compensation Committee setting the NEO compensation for 2018, FWC collected and analyzed comprehensive market data for the committee. FWC presented market figures representing competitive ranges for base salary, target short-term incentive opportunity, and long-term incentive opportunity. 
38 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Role of Named Executive Officers 
In 2018, our Chief Executive Officer developed compensation recommendations for the NEOs based on market data supplied by FWC, our Company's performance relative to goals approved by the Compensation Committee and other individual contributions to our performance. FWC examined market data from our peer group and analyzed compensation for comparable positions to our NEOs. The Compensation Committee considered the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations, in conjunction with the counsel of FWC and the market data, in determining the compensation elements for these NEOs. In considering the FWC report, the Compensation Committee primarily considered and reviewed the median level of compensation within the peer group. In setting actual compensation levels for our NEOs, however, the Compensation Committee did not target any element of compensation at a particular percentile or percentile range of the peer group data. Rather, the Compensation Committee uses this information as one input in its decision-making process. The Compensation Committee determined all aspects of Mr. Sloan's compensation as Chief Executive Officer in consultation with FWC. Mr. Sloan did not participate in the Compensation Committee's determination of his compensation. 
As of August 27, 2018, Mr. Mangum no longer served in his position as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, and subsequently left the Company, effective September 15, 2018. See "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 59 for a discussion of his separation arrangements. 
Shareholder Say-on-Pay Vote for 2017 and Compensation Actions Taken 
At last year's annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 98% of the votes cast were cast in support of the compensation of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee considered this a positive result and concluded that the shareholders support the compensation paid to our NEOs and our overall pay practices. In light of this support, the Compensation Committee decided to retain the overall design of our executive compensation program, subject to, as described above, the restructuring of the design by which performance units are earned in order to enhance the alignment between executive rewards and long-term gains for the Company and its shareholders. 
The Compensation Committee will continue to monitor best practices, future advisory votes on executive compensation and other shareholder feedback to guide it in evaluating our NEOs compensation program. The Compensation Committee invites our shareholders to communicate any concerns or opinions on executive pay directly to our board of directors. Please refer to "Board and Corporate Governance — Contacting Our Board of Directors" on page 29 for information about communicating with the board of directors.

The Compensation Committee considers adjustments to base salary for our NEOs on an annual basis and may do so more frequently upon a change in circumstances. The Compensation Committee determined to increase the salaries of Messrs. Mangum, Bready and Green and Dr. Sacchi for 2018 after considering, among other inputs, the market data on comparable positions from our peer group set forth in the FWC report, including but not limited to the median level of compensation for comparable positions, retention, internal equity, individual development and succession planning. The Compensation Committee also considered Mr. Sloan's assessment of Messrs. Mangum, Bready and Green and Dr. Sacchi. The Compensation Committee does not use a specific formula for evaluating the individual performance of each NEO. The Compensation Committee makes each assessment taking into consideration the competitiveness of each NEO's pay opportunity, the quality and effectiveness of each NEO's leadership and their respective contribution to the Company's financial and operational success, as well as the totality of the executive's performance. 
Short-Term Incentive Plan 
Under our short-term incentive plan, we provide our NEOs with short-term incentive opportunities to motivate and reward them for the achievement of our defined business goals and objectives. Our short-term incentive plan provides an opportunity for NEOs to earn variable at-risk cash. 
Target Bonus Opportunities 
For 2018, after review of the market data, our Compensation Committee approved the following target bonus opportunities for each of the NEOs, expressed as a percentage of base salary:

Performance Metrics 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee allocated the target opportunity under the short-term incentive plan evenly among the following three performance metrics: adjusted EPS, adjusted net revenue plus network fees and adjusted operating margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures. See Appendix A to this proxy statement for a description of the calculation of these measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. 
Because these performance metrics are calculated for the sole purpose of determining compensation, they may differ from similar non-GAAP financial measures reported elsewhere in Company filings. For each of these separately-calculated performance metrics, each NEO could earn from 0% to 200% of the target opportunity.

The TSR modifier is determined based on the Company's total shareholder return performance rank relative to the S&P 500 index over the entire three year performance period. The weighted average annual adjusted EPS growth rate, as determined above, is then modified up or down by the TSR modifier, to obtain a final payout percentage. This design rewards our NEOs for strong relative total shareholder return performance. 
Earned performance units will convert into unrestricted shares following the third anniversary of the performance unit grant date, provided that the Compensation Committee has previously certified the performance results described above. As a result, there is no payout of the award until the end of the three-year performance period. 
The following table summarizes the grant value and target number of performance units to each of the NEOs in 2018:

Stock Options 
In 2018, our Compensation Committee granted approximately 25% of the target February 2018 LTI value in stock options. Our Compensation Committee believes stock options provide a strong incentive for creation of long-term shareholder value, as stock options may be exercised for a profit only to the extent the price of the Company's stock appreciates after the grant date. The exercise price is the closing price of the stock on the grant date. We do not grant discounted options or re-price previously granted options. The stock options vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. During 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following stock option grants to each of the NEOs:

 the executive, which we do not gross up. In addition, we may ask our NEOs and their spouses to participate in President's Club trips offered as rewards to certain other employees for excellent sales or other performance. We treat the expenses of spouses as taxable income to the executives. Because spousal participation is at our request and can be disruptive to other plans they may have, we provide a gross up on that taxable income. 
Our NEOs are also eligible to participate in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, pursuant to which they may elect to defer up to 100% of their base salary and other forms of compensation. We do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan. In 2018, none of our NEOs made any contributions to or withdrawals from the plan. See "Compensation of Named Executive Officers — Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan" on page 55 for more detail regarding the plan. 
Employment Agreements 
We are party to an employment agreement with all of our NEOs. These employment agreements provide benefits to our Company that, we believe, are necessary in order to attract and retain highly-qualified executives. Each NEO has agreed not to disclose confidential information or compete with us, and not to solicit our customers or recruit our employees, for a period of generally 24 months following the termination of his or her employment. In exchange, we offer limited income and benefit protections to the NEO, but we do not provide for any excise tax gross-ups. On August 27, 2018, the Company entered into amendments to the employment agreements with all of our NEOs except Mr. Mangum, which extended the term of each such employment agreement through August 27, 2021. All other terms under the employment agreements remained the same. 
As of August 27, 2018, David Mangum no longer served as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer and subsequently left the Company, effective September 15, 2018. The payouts to Mr. Mangum under his employment agreement are discussed under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 59. 
Policies and Guidelines 
Policy Regarding Timing of Equity Grants 
Our Compensation Committee, in its discretion, typically makes the annual grant to all eligible employees shortly after the public disclosure of either the Company's fourth quarter earnings release or the filing of the Company's annual report, based upon the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. From time to time, our Compensation Committee may approve supplemental or other non-recurring grants outside of our annual compensation program. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
Our insider trading policy prohibits directors and employees from engaging in any transaction in which they profit if the value of our common stock declines. 
Target Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee has implemented stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs to foster equity ownership and align the interests of our NEOs with our shareholders. Within five years of the NEO's initial appointment to his or her position, our Chief Executive Officer is expected to beneficially own a number of shares at least equal to 500% of his or her base salary, and all other NEOs are expected to beneficially own a number of shares at least equal to 200% of their base salary. Additionally, each NEO is required to hold such shares until the NEO has met the applicable ownership guideline. Each of our NEOs was in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines as of the record date. 
Clawback Policy 
The Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy, pursuant to which we may recoup all or any portion of the value of any annual or long-term incentive awards provided to any current or former NEOs in the event that our financial statements are restated due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. 
46 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Code places a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to any one of our NEOs. Prior to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Jobs Act"), qualifying "performance-based" compensation was not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. 
However, the exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation was repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our NEOs in excess of $1 million will not be deductible. The Jobs Act provides for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing Section 162(m)'s exemption from the deduction limit is uncertain, so there can be no assurance that any compensation awarded will be fully deductible under all circumstances. Also, to maintain flexibility in compensating our NEOs, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to use its judgment to authorize compensation payments that may be subject to the deduction limit when the Compensation Committee believes that such payments are appropriate. 
Report of Compensation Committee Members 
The members of the Compensation Committee have reviewed and discussed the foregoing section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" with management. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee members recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement, which is to be incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018.

(3)  This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of awards of time-based restricted shares of our common stock  and awards of performance-based restricted stock units (including synergy units for the 2016 fiscal transition period). The aggregate grant date fair value of awards of performance units granted in 2017 and 2016 (including the synergy units granted  in the 2016 fiscal transition period) was calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, based on the value of the underlying shares and the probable outcome of performance-based vesting conditions on the grant date (at target performance  levels), excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. The grant date fair value of the 2018 performance units was calculated using the Monte Carlo model incorporating the following assumptions:

The Company used its historical stock prices as the basis for the volatility assumptions. The risk-free interest rates were based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the time of grant. The expected term was based on the time remaining in the performance period on the grant date.

The grantees do not have the right to vote the underlying shares, and dividends are not payable to the grantees until the units are converted into a stock grant at the end of the applicable performance period. Once  the stock grant is made, dividends are paid on such stock at the same rate as all of our other shareholders.

These performance units are earned based on the growth of our annual  adjusted EPS over each year (calculated separately) in the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2020, as may be further adjusted based on the TSR modifier. The final percentage of performance units earned is determined as the  average of each of the three annual adjusted EPS payout percentages (as a percent of target) and then multiplied by the TSR modifier.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred compensation plan. 
The following table provides information on deferred compensation under the deferred compensation plan for each NEO during 2018. Mr. Sloan is our only NEO who participates, but did not make any contributions or withdrawals, nor did he receive any distributions, during 2018. Aggregate earnings (Iosses) are not includable in the summary compensation table above because they were not above-market or preferential earnings. The aggregate balance includes amounts previously reported in the summary compensation table above in the previous years when earned if the NEO's compensation was required to be disclosed in a previous year.

Employment Agreements with Our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Mangum) 
Each of our NEOs is a party to an employment agreement with our Company. These agreements are for an initial term of three years and are automatically extended for one additional year on their second year anniversary and each anniversary thereafter unless either party provides notice of non-renewal before such anniversary date. The expiration dates are set forth below:

Each of these agreements prohibits the NEO from disclosing our confidential information, soliciting our customers or recruiting our employees for a period of 24 months following the termination of employment. In addition, if the NEO's employment is terminated by the Company or the NEO, the NEO has agreed not to compete with us generally for a period of 24 months. The non-compete does not apply if the NEO's employment is terminated as a result of the Company's decision not to extend the employment agreement. 
These employment agreements may be terminated by us at any time for "cause" (as defined below) or for no reason or by the NEO with or without "good reason" (as defined below). The employment agreements will also terminate upon the NEO's death, disability or retirement. Depending on the reason for the termination and when it occurs, the NEO will be entitled to certain severance benefits, as described below, which may be delayed for such time as may be necessary to avoid a violation of Section 409A of the Code. "Cause," as defined in the employment agreement, generally means (i) the failure by the NEO to perform substantially his or her responsibilities after a cure period of ten business days, (ii) fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or similar dishonest or wrongful act, (iii) substance abuse which materially interferes with the NEO's ability to perform, (iv) employment discrimination, harassment, conflicts of interest, retaliation, competition with our Company, solicitation of our customers or employees on behalf of anyone other than us, improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, or (v) conviction for, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or a crime involving dishonesty or other moral turpitude. "Good reason," as defined in the employment agreement, generally means (a) an assignment of the NEO to a materially different position, (b) a change in the person to whom the NEO reports, (c) a reduction of the NEO's base salary, bonus opportunity (to a target below the minimum specified in the agreement), or in welfare benefits, (d) a failure of our Company to require a successor-in-interest to agree to perform our obligations under the employment agreement, or (e) a requirement that the NEO be based in any location other than that which is initially specified in the agreement. 
Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason When Not Related to a Change in Control.    If, prior to a change in control or on or after the second anniversary of a change in control, the NEO's employment is terminated by us without cause or the NEO resigns for good reason, the NEO will be entitled to the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay the NEO's accrued salary and benefits through the separation date, plus a  pro-rata portion of his or her annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year of separation, based upon actual performance against certified pre-established bonus targets.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will continue to pay the NEO's base salary for six months, or, if such payments are delayed by reason of Code  Section 409A, make a lump sum payment equal to six months of the NEO's base salary on the date that is six months and one day after the separation date, in each case provided that the NEO does not violate any restrictive covenants.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For a period of up to 12 additional months (or the earlier of the NEO becoming employed with a competitor or violating any  restrictive covenants), we will continue to pay the NEO's base salary, provided that the NEO does not violate any restrictive covenants.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For a period of up to 12 months, we will pay the NEO's COBRA premiums, provided that the NEO does not obtain other  employment that provides health care coverage.  
[END TABLE]
56 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the NEO's restricted stock awards will vest as of the separation date, and the stock options that would have  vested in the next 24 months will vest and remain exercisable for no more than 90 days from the separation date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The NEO's performance-based restricted stock units will remain outstanding, and, after the Compensation Committee  certifies the results at the end of the performance period in which the separation date falls, the NEO will receive 50% of the number of shares that would have vested based on actual performance.  
[END TABLE]
Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason When Related to a Change in Control.    If, within 24 months after a change in control, the NEO's employment is terminated by us without cause or the NEO resigns for good reason, the NEO will be entitled to the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay the NEO's accrued salary and benefits through the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay the NEO 200% of the amount of the NEO's then-current base salary as a lump sum payment or payments,  provided that the NEO does not violate any restrictive covenants.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay the NEO 200% of the amount of the NEO's then-current target bonus opportunity, payable nine months after  the separation date, provided that the NEO does not violate any restrictive covenants.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay the NEO a pro-rated annual incentive bonus for the year in which the  termination occurs based on (i) the NEO's then-current target bonus opportunity, if the termination date occurs before the end of the year in which the change of control occurred, or (ii) the actual amount earned based on certified  results, if the termination date occurs during a year that began after the change in control occurred.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For a period of up to 18 months, we will pay the NEO's COBRA premiums, provided that the NEO does not obtain other  employment that provides health care coverage.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the NEO's restricted stock awards and stock options will vest as of the separation date, and the options will  remain exercisable for no more than 90 days from the separation date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The NEO's performance-based restricted stock units will convert into fully-vested shares of our common stock based on  (i) assumed target performance, if the date of termination occurs before the end of the performance cycle in which the change in control occurs, (ii) the greater of assumed target performance or actual performance, if the date of  termination occurs after the end of the performance cycle in which the change of control occurs, or (iii) actual performance, if the date of termination occurs during a performance cycle that began after the change in control occurred.   
[END TABLE]
The NEO also will be eligible for comparable benefits if his or her employment is terminated without cause or if he or she resigns for good reason in anticipation of a change-in-control transaction. The agreements specify that a termination or resignation is in anticipation of a change-in-control transaction if it occurs after a public announcement of a transaction which would lead to a change in control and the transaction closes no later than nine months after termination of the NEO's employment. 
Death or Disability.    Whether or not a change in control shall have occurred, if the NEO's employment is terminated by reason of death or disability, the NEO will be entitled to receive accrued salary and benefits through the date of termination and any other benefits that may apply, and all of the NEO's restricted stock awards and stock options will vest. The NEO's performance-based restricted stock units will convert into fully-vested shares of our common stock based upon assumed performance at the target level. 
Retirement.    Whether or not a change in control occurs, if the NEO's employment is terminated by reason of his or her retirement, the NEO will be entitled to receive accrued salary and benefits through the date of termination and any other benefits that may apply, and all of the NEO's restricted stock awards and stock options will vest. The NEO's performance-based restricted stock units will convert into fully-vested shares of our common stock based on actual performance as certified by the Compensation Committee at the end of the performance cycle. 
Termination for Cause or Resignation Without Good Reason.    If we terminate the NEO for cause, or if the NEO resigns without good reason, the NEO will be entitled to receive accrued salary and benefits through the date of termination, but no additional severance amount will be payable under the terms of the employment agreement. 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 57 
Change in Control Without Termination of Employment.    Our compensation arrangements with our NEOs are "double trigger," meaning that in order for the vesting of any of an NEO's awards to accelerate upon a change in control, there must be a change-in-control transaction as well as a termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason within 24 months after the change in control. As a result, if there is no such termination or resignation, then the vesting of the NEO's awards will not be accelerated in connection with the change in control. 
Potential Payments Table 
The following table sets forth quantitatively the potential post-employment payments that are described above for each of our NEOs (other than Mr. Mangum). The potential payments to our NEOs are hypothetical situations only and assume that termination of employment and/or change-in-control occurred on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown in the table do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to salaried employees generally upon termination of employment, such as accrued salary and distributions of plan balances under our tax-qualified 401(k) plan. The value of the acceleration of vesting of stock options, restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units are calculated based on the $103.13 closing price on December 31, 2018. The value of health care continuation is based on COBRA rates.

Payments Made to Former NEO 
As previously disclosed, as of August 27, 2018, David Mangum no longer served as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer and subsequently left the Company, effective September 15, 2018. The compensation that Mr. Mangum has received or will receive, as applicable, in connection with his departure is limited to, and does not exceed, the compensation that he was entitled to receive pursuant to his employment agreement, which includes the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Mangum will receive a lump sum cash payment of $325,000, representing his base salary for a six-month period, which will be made to Mr. Mangum on or about March 18, 2019. In addition, commencing on April 15, 2019, he will continue to receive his base salary for a period of up to an  additional 12 months (or $650,000 in the aggregate for the 12-month period), provided that these payments will cease if Mr. Mangum violates any of the restrictive covenants in his employment agreement.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Mangum received a lump sum cash payment of $669,067, representing his 2018 cash incentive bonus target based on  actual performance, as certified by the Compensation Committee, prorated for the full months of employment through his separation date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the restricted shares of our common stock that Mr. Mangum owned as of September 15, 2018 vested as of  September 17, 2018, the first business day following his separation date. As of September 15, 2018, Mr. Mangum owned 81,645 unvested restricted shares of our common stock. The value of these shares based on the closing price of our  stock on September 17, 2018 was $10,366,466.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the stock options that Mr. Mangum owned as of September 15, 2018 and that would have become exercisable on  or before September 15, 2020 vested as of September 17, 2018, the first business day following his separation date. As of September 15, 2018, Mr. Mangum owned 29,629 stock options that would have vested on or before the day 24  months thereafter. The intrinsic value of these options on September 17, 2018, based on the closing price of our stock on that date, was $993,912.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Mangum's performance units that he received in the 2016 fiscal transition period and calendar 2017 and 2018  will remain outstanding, and after the Compensation Committee certifies the results at the end of the performance period, Mr. Mangum will receive 50% of the number of shares that would have been earned and vested based on actual performance.  Assuming a payout multiple of 300% for the 2018 performance units based on a result of actual performance during the first year of the three year performance period, and a maximum payout multiple of 200% for the 2017 and 2016 fiscal transition  period performance units based on the results of the actual performance during the first two years of the respective three year performance periods, his performance units would convert into 35,878 unrestricted shares valued at $4,555,430 based on  the closing price of our stock on September 17, 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) and the annual total compensation of Jeffrey S. Sloan, our Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported below should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of the median employee was $60,931; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented  earlier in this Proxy, was $16,818,560 (which amount is exclusive of $21,056 in employer-provided health and welfare benefits).  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of the median employee to the annual total compensation of Mr. Sloan, our Chief Executive Officer, was 1 to 276. 
To determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected December 31, 2018 as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee."   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 10,896 employees working at the Company and its  consolidated subsidiaries.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As is permitted under SEC rules, we eliminated 390 global employees (approximately 3.58% of our total population) from the  data set. A list of the excluded employees and their country of residency is provided in the table below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Hungary    55    Malta    16    Slovakia    17 
 India    116    New Zealand    13    Sri Lanka    37 
 Macao    6    Romania    11    Taiwan    51 
 Malaysia    46    Singapore    22           
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To determine our "median employee" from our adjusted employee population, we used a consistently applied  compensation definition and chose "base pay (actual)." We used a stratified statistical sampling methodology to provide a reasonable estimate of the median base pay for the employee population considered. We conducted an analysis using a  sample of 10,506 employees. Then we identified employees who we expected were paid within approximately a +/- 10% range of that value, based on our assumptions that the median employee was likely to be within that group and that those within that  group had substantially similarly probabilities of being the median employee. We then analyzed taxable wages for this group (annualizing pay for permanent employees who commenced work during 2018) to select a single median employee. We did not  change our methodology or material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates from those used in our pay ratio disclosure for 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Using this methodology, we determined that the "median employee" was a full-time, hourly employee located in the  United States, with base pay (actual) for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018 in the amount of $46,498. We determined that the same median employee used for the year ended December 31, 2017  can be used again because there has not been a change in our employee population or employee compensation programs that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the annual total compensation of the "median employee," we identified and calculated the elements  of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item  
[END TABLE]

• With respect to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, we used the amount reported in the  "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table, plus the value of employer-provided health and welfare benefits in the amount of $21,056, which was not included in the Summary Compensation Table.

Proposal Three: Ratification of Reappointment of Auditors 
We are asking you to ratify the appointment of Deloitte for the year ending December 31, 2019. Ratification of the selection of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by the SEC or NYSE rules, Georgia law, the Company's articles of incorporation or the Company's bylaws. However, the board of directors is submitting the selection of Deloitte to shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If a majority of shareholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will consider the selection of other independent public accountants for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the appointment by the Audit Committee of the Company's board of directors of Deloitte as independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, to audit the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019, is ratified and approved. 
The Audit Committee recommends, and the board of directors selects, our independent public accountants. Our Audit Committee has determined that it is in the best interest of our Company and its shareholders to continue to retain Deloitte, who served during 2018, to serve as our independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2019, and the board has approved the selection. A representative of Deloitte is expected to be present at the annual meeting. The representative will be given the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
In accordance with applicable SEC rules, the Audit Committee issued the following report on February 20, 2019. The Audit Committee consisted of the following members as of such date: William B. Plummer (Chair), John M. Partridge and Alan M. Silberstein, each of whom is independent under the listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in a written Audit Committee charter which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com. The Audit Committee reviews the charter annually and, when appropriate, recommends any changes to the board for approval. 
The primary responsibility of the Audit Committee is to oversee our financial reporting process on behalf of the board and to report the results of the Audit Committee's activities to the board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal control, and the independent registered public accounting firm (Deloitte) is responsible for auditing those financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, and issuing a report thereon. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the compensation, retention and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and meets with the Company's internal auditors and independent auditors, with and without management present (in person or by telephone), to discuss the scope, plan, status and results of their respective audits. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with management and the independent auditors to review the Company's financial results and earnings press releases related thereto prior to their issuance. 
In 2018, the Audit Committee held six meetings. Meeting agendas are established by the Audit Committee Chair, based on input from the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer. During 2018, among other things, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• met with the senior members of the Company's financial management team at each regularly scheduled meeting;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• held separate private sessions, during its regularly scheduled meetings, with each of the Company's General Counsel,  the independent auditors, and the Senior VP of Internal Audit, at which candid discussions regarding financial management, legal, accounting, auditing and internal control matters took place;  
[END TABLE]
62 – GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• received periodic updates on management's processes to assess the adequacy of the Company's internal controls  over financial reporting and the framework used to make the assessment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• received periodic updates from management on the Company's financial risk management practices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte the Company's earnings releases and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K prior to filing with the SEC;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and approved the Company's internal audit plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• participated, with representatives of management and Deloitte, in educational sessions  about various relevant topics of interest to the Audit Committee.  
[END TABLE]
Deloitte has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. Before retaining Deloitte for the year ending December 31, 2019, the Audit Committee evaluated Deloitte's performance with respect to its services to the Company provided during 2018. In conducting this evaluation, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management matters related to Deloitte's independence, technical expertise and industry knowledge. The Audit Committee also reviewed Deloitte's communications with the Audit Committee during 2018 and considered Deloitte's tenure. In addition, in order to ensure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent public accounting firm. The Audit Committee ensures that the mandated rotation of Deloitte's personnel occurs routinely and is directly involved in the selection of Deloitte's lead engagement partner. 
In keeping with its responsibilities and the performance of its oversight function, the members of the Audit Committee as of February 20, 2019 have reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and for the twelve months then ended. The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communication with Audit Committees). The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with Deloitte its independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has considered the compatibility of non-audit services with Deloitte's independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the members of the Audit Committee as of February 20, 2019 recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018 filed with the SEC.

 Total     $ 7,737,273      $ 6,648,071  
[END TABLE]
Audit fees.    Audit fees represent fees for the audit of our annual financial statements, the reviews of the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. 
GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 63 
Audit-related fees.    Audit-related fees represent fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not included under "Audit fees" disclosed above. Each period includes fees for reports on service organization controls and other fees associated with various initiatives by the Company. In 2017, the audit-related fees also reflect the Company's adoption of ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
Tax fees.    Tax fees represent fees for tax compliance, tax consulting and advisory services. In 2018, $236,248 of the fees were for tax return preparation and compliance, and $1,789,075 were for tax consulting and advisory services primarily related to the Jobs Act. In 2017, $136,855 of the fees were for tax return preparation and compliance, and $672,640 were for tax consulting and advisory services. 
All other fees.    There were no other fees for the periods presented. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies 
The Audit Committee must approve any audit services and any permissible non-audit services provided by Deloitte prior to the commencement of the services, and is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the engagement. In making its pre-approval determination, the Audit Committee considers whether providing the non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence. To minimize relationships which could appear to impair the objectivity of the independent registered public accounting firm, it is generally the Audit Committee's practice to restrict the non-audit services that may be provided to us by our independent auditor to audit-related services, tax services and merger and acquisition due diligence and integration services, but other permissible non-audit services are approved on a case-by-case basis. 
The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee the authority to approve non-audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm within the guidelines set forth above, provided that the fees associated with the applicable engagement are not anticipated to exceed $250,000. Any decision by the Chair to pre-approve non-audit services must be presented to the full Audit Committee for ratification at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services described above were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the foregoing policy.

Additional Information 
Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
We review all known relationships and transactions in which we and our directors and NEOs or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether they qualify for disclosure as a transaction with related persons under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. We screen for these relationships and transactions through the annual circulation of a Directors and Officers Questionnaire, or a D&O Questionnaire, to each member of the board of directors and each of our officers who is a reporting person under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The D&O Questionnaire contains questions intended to identify related persons and transactions between us and related persons. Our Employee Code of Conduct and Ethics requires employees to report to the General Counsel or Chief Executive Officer any transaction involving themselves or their immediate family members and our Company that may create a conflict of interest with us, and further requires the Chief Executive Officer to approve in writing any such transaction with a related person. Any related-party transaction that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K must be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee pursuant to the responsibilities set forth in its charter. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee evaluates the relevant facts and circumstances, including the fairness of the terms of the transaction, the benefit of the transaction to the Company, the impact on a director or officer's independence, the availability of the goods or services from other sources and other facts considered material by the Audit Committee. 
There were no transactions with related persons required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K since January 1, 2018, except as set forth below. 
On October 17, 2018, we completed the acquisition of SICOM from a fund owned by LLR Partners in a cash transaction valued at approximately $415 million. The transaction qualified as a related party transaction under Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, as one of the Company's directors, Mitchell L. Hollin, is an investor in the fund and a partner of the management company which manages and controls LLR Partners. Mr. Hollin's direct interest in the transaction equaled approximately $1.1 million, which was the amount distributed to Mr. Hollin based on his investment interest in the LLR fund which owned SICOM. 
In accordance with the audit committee charter, the Audit Committee is required to approve all related party transactions. In determining whether to approve the acquisition of SICOM, the Audit Committee considered, among other things, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms of the transaction were fair to the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction was material to the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the interests of Mr. Hollin in the transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the structure of the transaction.  
[END TABLE]
Based on a consideration of all the material facts, including the foregoing as well as a fairness opinion from an independent, third-party investment banking firm, the Audit Committee determined that the terms of the transaction were fair to and in the best interests of the Company and approved the acquisition of SICOM. 
As a result of his interest in the transaction, the board of directors determined that Mr. Hollin was no longer independent under the listing standards of the NYSE and accordingly, Mr. Hollin was removed from the Company's Compensation Committee and was appointed to the Company's Technology Committee. 
2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
A copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and financial statement schedules (but without exhibits) for 2018, will be provided, free of charge, upon written request of any shareholder addressed to Global Payments Inc., 3550 Lenox Road, Suite 3000 Atlanta, Georgia 30326, Attention: Investor Relations.

GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement  – 65 
Shareholders Sharing the Same Address 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering to that address a single proxy statement to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," provides convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. Some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you notify us or your broker that you no longer wish to participate in householding. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish to receive only one copy, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account, or notify us if you hold registered shares. You can notify us by sending a written request to Global Payments Inc., c/o Corporate Secretary, 3550 Lenox Road, Suite 3000, Atlanta, Georgia 30326 or by contacting Investor Relations at Investor.Relations@globalpay.com or (770)  829-8478. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Based solely on a review of copies of Forms 3 and 4 filed with the SEC, or written representations that no annual forms (Form 5) were required, we believe that, during 2018, all of our officers, directors and 10% shareholders complied with the reporting requirements of the SEC regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our common stock (as required pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act), with the following exception: one Form 4 with respect to the purchase of shares under the Company's employee stock purchase plan for Mr. Sheffield was not timely filed. This transaction was subsequently reported and all errors have been corrected in subsequent filings. 
Shareholder List 
We will maintain a list of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting at our corporate offices at 3550 Lenox Road, Atlanta, GA 30326. The list will be available for examination at the annual meeting.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In this proxy statement, we disclose performance goals related to cash incentive awards under our short-term incentive plan based on adjusted EPS, adjusted net revenue plus network fees and adjusted operating margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Set forth below is a methodology for determining, and the rational for using, these terms.

Adjusted EPS     Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to the Company, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, by the  diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding.   Adjusted net income attributable to  the Company for 2018 reflects adjustments to remove (i) amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) employee termination costs; (iii) acquisition and integration costs (iv) share-based compensation expense; (v) asset  abandonment charges; (vi) a gain recognized on the reorganization of an association of which the Company was a member through one of its Canadian subsidiaries; (vii) a charge associated with the refinancing of our corporate credit  facility; (viii) an income tax benefit related to tax reform true-ups; (ix) a tax expense associated with certain discrete tax items related to the impact of changes in state effective income tax  rates on deferred liabilities; and (x) the income tax effect of the aforementioned adjustments.     Adjusted EPS is a primary metric management uses to more clearly focus on the economic benefits to our core business and other factors we believe are pertinent to the daily  management of our operations.

Adjusted EPS, adjusted net revenue plus network fees and adjusted operating margin should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, GAAP diluted earnings per share, revenue and operating income, respectively.
