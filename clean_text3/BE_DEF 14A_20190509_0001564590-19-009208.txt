Dear Fellow Stockholders,
It is my pleasure to invite you to our first annual meeting of stockholders.  The meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m., May 9, 2019 at the Courtyard by Marriott San Jose North / Silicon Valley at 111 Holger Way, San Jose, CA 95134.  
I hope you will take the opportunity to vote the shares of stock you own for the election of the three Class I directors identified in the attached proxy statement and for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.  
2018 was a pivotal year for Bloom Energy.  We completed our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange and made strong progress on our strategic priorities to drive growth, maintain our fast-paced technical innovation and reduce cost. 
Our value proposition is more and more relevant every day to our expanding customer base.  Commercial and industrial companies experienced more and longer grid power outages than ever before.  Many now also face the prospect of higher rates as the cost of protecting overhead transmission lines from escalating extreme weather events must be borne by rate payers. Nationwide, the U.S. also saw an increase in energy-related CO2 emissions for the first time in several years.  
Our mission to deliver clean, affordable, resilient, Always On power for the world has never been more relevant.
All of these factors and our own strong business performance helped propel Bloom Energy to a record year in 2018.  In 2018, we grew acceptances (the number of systems deployed and generating revenue) by 30% versus 2017 and delivered full year revenue of $742.0 million, up 97.4% year-over-year including the benefit of the investment tax credit.  
We continued to drive down the cost of our existing commercial platform in 2018.  At the same time, we are ramping R&D efforts on our next generation platform which will deliver 33% more power in the same physical footprint and provide a further basis for cost-down.  
Lastly, we ended 2018 with new orders spanning multiple countries and a highly diversified set of industries, including data center/cloud services, healthcare, retail, hospitality, advanced manufacturing, higher education, real estate, government and utilities.  
Overall, Bloom has never been stronger or more focused on realizing the opportunity before us.  
I thank you for your continued interest in and support of Bloom Energy Corporation.  
Yours sincerely,
KR Sridhar, Founder, CEO and Chairman

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING
General Proxy Information
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is being furnished to the stockholders of Bloom Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company", "Bloom", "we", "us" or "our"), in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") for use at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2019 Annual Meeting") to be held at the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, 111 Holger Way, San Jose, California 95134 on Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. PT, local time and at any and all adjournments, postponements or continuations of the meeting.  
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
As permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are using the Internet as a means of furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders.  We believe this method will make the proxy distribution process more efficient, lower costs and help in conserving natural resources.  
On or about March 26, 2019, we expect to send to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials, including our Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The Notice also provides instructions on how to vote through the Internet or by telephone and includes instructions on how to request a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail.  
The Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K are available at www.proxyvote.com.  We will provide to any stockholder without charge, upon written or oral request, a copy of our Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K (without exhibits).  Requests should be directed to Bloom Energy Corporation, 4353 North First Street, San Jose, California 95134, Attention: Corporate Secretary or by calling (408) 543-1500.  
Information About the Annual Meeting
Who can vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  At the close of business on the Record Date, there were 58,613,640  shares of the Company's Class A common stock  and 54,325,909 shares of the Company's Class B common stock  outstanding and entitled to vote.

2   2019 Proxy Statement
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING
How do I attend the 2019 Annual Meeting and vote in person? 
Attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting will be limited to stockholders of the Company as of the close of business on the Record Date.  Each stockholder should be prepared to present valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport and proof of stock ownership as of the Record Date.  Stockholders holding their shares of Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee will need to bring proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record Date, such as their most recent account statement reflecting their Common Stock ownership prior to the Record Date, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by their broker, bank, or other nominee, or similar evidence of ownership.  If you are a stockholder of record as of the close of business on the Record Date and wish to vote in person, we will provide you with a ballot to use to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  If you are a beneficial owner and hold shares of Common Stock through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may not vote your shares of Common Stock in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of Common Stock giving you the right to vote the shares of Common Stock at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
Even if you plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy or voting instructions as described in the Proxy Statement so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting.  You may still attend the meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.  
How many votes do I have? 
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of Class A common stock and ten votes for each share of Class B common stock you owned as of the close of business on the Record Date.  The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together on each matter presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
What am I voting on? 
You are being asked to vote on the following:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• election of three Class 1 directors to serve until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; 
• ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; and 
• any other business as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting or any adjournment, continuation or postponement thereof.   
[END TABLE]
How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on these proposals? 
The Company's Board recommends the following:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of General Colin Powell, Scott Sandell and KR Sridhar as Class I directors. 
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
How do I vote my shares? 
The procedures for voting are as follows:  
Stockholder of Record:  Shares Registered in Your Name
If, as of March 11, 2019, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock & Transfer, then you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares.  As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting, or vote by proxy over the telephone, through the Internet, or by using a proxy card that you may request or that we may elect to deliver to you at a later time.  The method you use to vote will not limit your right to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting if you decide to attend in person.  Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to submit your proxy in advance.  You may still attend the meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.  
Bloom Energy Corporation   3
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING
To vote through the Internet:  Go to www.proxyvote.com to complete an electronic proxy card.  You will be asked to provide the control number from your Notice.  Your Internet vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2019, to be counted.  
To vote by telephone:  Dial toll-free 1-800-690-6903 using a touch-tone phone and follow the recorded instructions.  You will be asked to provide the control number from the Notice.  Your telephone vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2019, to be counted.  
To vote by mail:  If you received your proxy materials via the U.S. mail, you may complete, sign and return the accompanying proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.  If you return your signed proxy card to us and we receive it before the 2019 Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.  
To vote in person:  Attend the 2019 Annual Meeting at the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, 111 Holger Way, San Jose, California 95134, and we will give you a ballot when you arrive.  
Beneficial Owner:  Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If, on March 11, 2019, your shares were held in an account with a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of the shares held in street name.  As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee how to vote the shares held in your account.  However, the organization that holds your shares is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the meeting.  Because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from the organization that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.  You should have received a voting instruction card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from your brokerage firm, bank or other agent rather than from us.  Simply complete and mail the voting instruction card to ensure that your vote is counted.  Internet or telephonic voting may also be available; however, that will depend on the voting process of your broker, bank or other nominee.  Please see your voting instruction card for further details.  
How will my shares be voted if I return a blank proxy card?
If you return a signed and dated proxy card or otherwise submit a proxy without indicating voting selections, your shares will be voted, as applicable, "For" the election of each Class I director nominee and "For" the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  If any other matter is properly presented at the meeting, your proxyholder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares using his or her best judgment.  
How will my shares be voted if I do not provide my broker or bank with voting instructions, and what is a "broker non-vote"?
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee how to vote your shares, your broker, bank, or other nominee may still be able to vote your shares in its discretion on certain matters.  Brokers, banks, and other securities intermediaries may use their discretion to vote your "uninstructed" shares with respect to matters considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" matters.  In this regard, Proposal 1 is considered to be "non-routine," meaning that your broker may not vote your shares on that proposal in the absence of your voting instructions.  Proposal 2 is considered to be a "routine" matter, meaning that if you do not return voting instructions to your broker by its deadline, your shares may be voted by your broker in its discretion on Proposal 2.  If a broker, bank or other nominee exercises their discretionary voting authority on Proposal 2, such shares will be considered present at the annual meeting for quorum purposes, counted in the voting results for Proposal 2 and a broker non-vote will occur as to Proposal 1.  
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would prefer, you must provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your broker, bank, or other nominee.  
4   2019 Proxy Statement
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal?
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No 1: The election of directors requires a plurality vote of the shares of our Common Stock present in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  "Plurality" means that the nominees who receive the largest number of votes cast "for" such nominee are elected as directors.  As a result with respect to the election of three Class I directors, the three nominees receiving the most "for" votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be elected.  "Withhold" votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect.   
• Proposal No 2: The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, requires that a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote are present in person or represented by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting and are voted for the matter.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect.   
[END TABLE]
Who is making this solicitation? 
The Company's Board is soliciting these proxies and the cost of such solicitation will be borne by the Company, including the charges and expenses of persons holding shares in their name as nominee incurred in connection with forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of such shares.  In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by our officers, directors and employees in person, by telephone or by email.  Such individuals will not be additionally compensated for such solicitation but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such solicitation.  
What is the quorum requirement? 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid 2019 Annual Meeting.  Our Bylaws provided that a quorum will be present if a majority of the voting power of all shares outstanding on the Record Date are represented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, present in person or by proxy.  Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy or vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting, or if you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, if you submit your voting instructions or if your bank, broker or other nominee exercise its voting discretion over such shares.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.  
What is "householding" and how does it affect me?
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, we send only one proxy statement and one annual report to eligible stockholders who share a single address, unless we have received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address.  This practice is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs.  Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards.  We do not use householding for any other stockholder mailings.  
If you share an address with another stockholder and receive only one set of proxy materials but would like to request a separate copy of these materials, please contact our mailing agent, Broadridge, by calling 1-800-540-7095 or by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York, 11717.  Similarly, you may also contact Broadridge if you receive multiple copies of the proxy materials and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future.  If you own shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you should contact the nominee concerning householding procedures.  
How can I find out the results of the voting at the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the 2019 Annual Meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days of the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
If you receive more than one proxy card, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts.  Please complete, sign and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted.  
Bloom Energy Corporation   5
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
Yes.  You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  You may revoke your proxy in any one of following ways:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date.   
• You may grant a subsequent proxy by telephone or through the Internet.   
• You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at 4353 North First Street, San Jose, California 95134.  Such notice will be considered timely if it is received at the indicated address by the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
• You may attend the 2019 Annual Meeting and vote in person.  However, simply attending the 2019 Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.   
[END TABLE]
Your most recently submitted proxy card or telephone or internet proxy is the one that is counted.  
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If your shares are held by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee.  Please note that if your shares are held of record by a bank, broker or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at our annual meeting, your vote in person at the meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued in your name from the record holder (your bank, broker or other nominee).  
6   2019 Proxy Statement
PROPOSAL 1
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Restated Bylaws provide that our Board of Directors will be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms.  As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms.  Each director's term will continue until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.  
The Board of Directors presently has nine members.  The authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Directors in Class I will stand for election at this meeting.  Each nominee has consented to be named a nominee in the Proxy Statement and to continue to serve as a director, if elected.  If any nominee becomes unavailable to serve for any reason before the election, which is not anticipated, your proxy authorizes us to vote for another person nominated by the Board or the Board may reduce its size.   There are no arrangements or understandings between any director and any other person pursuant to which he or she is or was to be selected as a director.  There are no family relationships among directors or executive officers of the Company.  
Vote Required
The election of directors will be made by a plurality of votes cast at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  That means the three nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be elected.  Because directors need only be elected by plurality of the vote, abstentions, broker non-votes and withhold votes will not affect whether any particular nominee has received sufficient votes to be elected.  
As described in detail below, our nominees have considerable professional and business experience.  The recommendation of our Board is based on its carefully considered judgement that the qualifications and experience of our nominees make them well qualified to serve on our Board and give the Board as a group the appropriate skills to exercise its oversight responsibilities.  
Information Regarding Nominees and Continuing Directors 
Set forth below are descriptions of the business and other experience of the nominees and continuing directors as well as a summary of the experience, qualifications, qualities and skills that led to the conclusion that each director should serve as a member of our Board of Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
INFORMATION REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Director Independence
The listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") generally require that a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors be independent within one year following the closing of an initial public offering.  In addition, the listing rules generally require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent within one year following the completion of our initial public offering ("IPO").  
Under the listing standards of the NYSE, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of that listed company's board of directors, that director does not have a material relationship with the listed company, either directly or indirectly, that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.  
Based on the information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board of Directors has determined that none of our non-employee directors has a material relationship with the Company, either directly or indirectly, that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that, with the exception of General Powell,  each of our non-employee directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.  In making this determination, the Board of Directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director.  Mr. Sridhar is not independent due to his role as the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  General Powell is not independent under NYSE listing rules given the compensation he receives from us under a consulting agreement.  The Company has a long standing consulting relationship with General Powell under which he assists the Company with our selling and marketing efforts.  
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not require the separation of the offices of the Chairperson and the Chief Executive Officer.  When the positions of Chairperson and the Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person, the Board of Directors will designate a lead independent director.  The position of lead independent director has been structured to serve as an effective balance to a combined Chief Executive Officer/Board chairperson role.  
KR Sridhar, the Company's Founder and Chief Executive Officer, is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors which the Board believes is currently in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.  As one of the initial Founders of the Company and Chief Executive Officer for almost twenty years, Mr. Sridhar has led the Company from idea conception and the Board believes Mr. Sridhar has proven that he is effective at leading the day to day operations as well as identifying and communicating our strategic priorities and leading the execution of our strategy.  Mr. Sridhar's direct involvement in operations of the Company puts him in the best position to propose short- and long-term objectives for the business.  This ensures that the Board of Directors focuses on important strategic objectives yet also understands the challenges the Company faces on a day-to-day basis.  Combining the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board also provides a clear chain of command and single point of accountability to execute the Company's strategy.  The non-management directors meet in regular executive sessions, which allows them to review key decisions and to discuss matters independently of Mr. Sridhar.  The lead independent director presides at such sessions.  
John Doerr currently serves as the lead independent director.  As lead independent director, Mr. Doerr presides over periodic meetings of our independent non-management directors, serves as a liaison between the chairperson of our Board of Directors and the independent directors, provides input to the Chairman on the schedule and agenda of Board meetings and performs such additional duties as our Board of Directors may otherwise determine and delegate.

Board Composition
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
As part of its oversight function, our Board of Directors has responsibility for overseeing our risk management and believes that a thorough and strategic approach to risk oversight is critical.  The Board of Directors exercises this oversight responsibility directly and through its committees.  The oversight responsibility of the Board of Directors and its committees is informed by regular reports from our management team, including senior personnel that lead a variety of functions across the business, as well as input from external advisors, as appropriate.  These reports are designed to provide timely visibility to the Board of Directors and its committees about the identification and assessment of key risks, our risk mitigation strategies, and ongoing developments.  
The full Board of Directors has primary responsibility for evaluating strategic and operational risk management.  Our Audit Committee has the responsibility for overseeing our major financial, legal, and regulatory risk exposures, which span a variety of areas including litigation, legal and regulatory compliance, reputational and policy matters, financial reporting and controls, credit and liquidity, IT, tax, conflicts of interest and related party transactions, cybersecurity, and international operations.  Our Audit Committee also oversees the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including policies and procedures for assessing and managing risk and related compliance efforts.  Our Compensation and Organization Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee") evaluates risks arising from compensation policies and practices and ensures they do not incentivize excessive risk taking as well as risks related to recruiting, retention, attrition and succession planning.  Our Nominating, Governance and Public Policy Committee (the "Nominating Committee") evaluates risks arising from our corporate governance practices, leadership structure of the Board of Directors, compensation of the Board of Directors and public policy developments.  Each of our committees provide reports to the full Board of Directors regarding these and other matters.  
Emerging Growth Company Status; Post-IPO Transition
Emerging Growth Company Status  
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last completed fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act.  An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies.  These reduced reporting requirements include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; 
• an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
• reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
[END TABLE]
Bloom Energy Corporation   15
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an exemption from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and a stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements; and 
• extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 
[END TABLE]
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the end of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (2) the end of the first fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer," as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (4) the end of  our 2023 fiscal year, during which the fifth anniversary of our IPO occurs.  We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available benefits under the JOBS Act.  We currently intend to take advantage of the exemptions discussed above until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company.  
NYSE Transition Rules
The rules of the NYSE allow certain transition periods for newly public companies to fully comply with its corporate governance listing standards.  We are currently relying on such transition rules with respect to the composition of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee and expect to fully comply with NYSE corporate governance listing standards at or before the time that those transition periods end in July 2019.  
Dual Class Structure 
Our Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share.  Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our Common Stock.  
The Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder.  In addition, the Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock immediately prior to the close of business on the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (July 2023), and may automatically convert earlier than such date upon certain circumstances as described in our Certificate of Incorporation.  
Board of Directors Meetings and Annual Meeting Attendance
The Board of Directors held six meetings and acted two times by unanimous written consent during the year ended December 31, 2018.  Additionally, from time to time between formal meetings, members of the Board participate in update or status phone call and briefings, which are not included in the total.  Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of Board of Directors meetings and meetings of committees on which he or she served during the portion of the last fiscal year for which he or she was a director or committee member.  It is the Company's policy to encourage our directors to attend annual meetings of stockholders and it is our expectation that all directors will attend the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has three standing committees:  the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee.  Members serve on these committees until their resignations or until otherwise determined by our Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors has adopted written charters for each committee, which are available on the Company's website at http://investor.bloomenergy.com under the "Corporate Governance" tab.  
Audit Committee
Our Audit Committee is comprised of the Honorable Mary K. Bush, who is the Chair of the Audit Committee, and Mr. Zervigon.  The Audit Committee adopted a written charter that was approved by our Board of Directors that among other things, specifies the scope of its rights and responsibilities and satisfies the

The Nominating Committee held one meeting during year ended December 31, 2018.
Board Membership Criteria 
The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying, evaluating and recommending candidates to the Board of Directors for Board membership.  The Nominating Committee may use outside consultants to assist in identifying candidates.  When formulating its Board membership recommendations, the Nominating Committee will also consider advice and recommendations from stockholders, management, and others as it deems appropriate.  The Nominating Committee will consider candidates for the Board recommended by stockholders using the same criteria in evaluating the candidate as it would any other Board nominee candidate.  
The Nominating Committee will also evaluate whether an incumbent director should be nominated for re-election to the Board upon expiration of such director's term, based upon factors established for new director candidates as well as the incumbent director's qualifications, performance as a Board member, and such other factors as the Nominating Committee deems appropriate.  
Nominees for director will be selected on the basis of, among other things, independence, integrity, diversity, skills, financial and other expertise, breadth of experience, knowledge about our business or industry, willingness and ability to devote adequate time and effort to Board of Directors responsibilities in the context of the existing composition, other areas that are expected to contribute to the Board of Directors' overall effectiveness and the needs of the Board of Directors and its committees.  
In evaluating potential candidates for the Board, the Nominating Committee will consider the following factors, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Stockholder Nominations 
Any stockholder may nominate a person for election as a director by complying with the procedures set forth in our Bylaws or may recommend a director pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8.  See Stockholder Proposals and Nominations. 
Related Party Transactions
Concurrent with our IPO in July 2018, the Board of Directors adopted a related party transactions policy which, along with the charter of our Audit Committee, require that any transaction with a related party that must be reported under the applicable rules of the SEC must be reviewed and approved or ratified by our Audit Committee, unless the related party is, or is associated with, a member of the Audit Committee, in which event the transaction must be reviewed and approved by our Nominating Committee.  
Our related party transactions policy will apply to transactions, arrangements or relationships in which we are a participant, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  A related party is: (i) any of our directors, nominees for director or executive officers, (ii) any immediate family member of a director, nominee for director or executive officer, and (iii) any person, and his or her immediate family members, or entity that is known by us to be a beneficial owner of 5% or more of any of our outstanding equity securities at the time the transaction occurred or existed.  
In determining whether to approve or reject a related party transaction, the Audit Committee considers the relevant and available facts, including the impact on a director's independence if the related party is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated, the terms of the transaction and any other relevant information and considerations.  The Audit Committee will approve only those transactions with related parties that, in light of known circumstances, are in or are not inconsistent with, the best interest of the Company and its stockholders, as the Audit Committee determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.  The Audit Committee may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on the Company or the related party in connection with the approval of the proposed transaction.  
Prior to our IPO, we had no formal, written policy or procedure for the review and approval of related party transactions.  However, our practice had been to have all related party transactions reviewed and approved by a majority of the disinterested members of our Board of Directors, including the transactions described below.  Other than as disclosed below, there were no transactions since January 1, 2018 in which any related party had a direct or indirect material interest pursuant to the terms of our related party transactions policy.
Consulting Arrangement
In January 2009, we entered into a consulting agreement with General Colin L. Powell, a member of our Board of Directors, pursuant to which General Powell performs certain strategic planning and advisory services for us.  Pursuant to this consulting agreement, General Powell receives compensation of $125,000 
Bloom Energy Corporation   19
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
per year and reimbursement for reasonable expenses.  General Powell received $125,000 in compensation and reimbursements for the year ended December 31, 2018 pursuant to this consulting agreement.  
Debt and Convertible Promissory Note Financing 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $308.1 million in debt from investors considered to be related parties.  
Over the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we obtained $40.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in term loans due September 2028 from Alberta Investment Management Corporation ("Alberta") to fund the purchase and installation of Energy Servers related to PPA IIIa.  The loan bears a fixed interest rate of 7.5% and the total debt balance was $40.5 million as of December 31, 2018.  
Between December 2014 and June 2015, we issued and sold $193.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 8% Notes to certain investors at a purchase price of 100% of the aggregate principal thereon, including $10.0 million aggregate principal amount, issued in 2014, each to Alberta, KPCB Holdings, Inc.  ("KPCB") and New Enterprise Associates ("NEA").  The 8% Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 8%, compounded monthly and mandatorily converted into equity upon the closing of our IPO on July 27, 2018.  
In September 2015, we issued $12.5 million in principal amount of our 6% Notes to KPCB and $12.5 million in principal amount of our 6% Notes to NEA pursuant to a note purchase agreement.  In December 2015, we issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6% Notes to the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB") pursuant to a note purchase agreement and we agreed to issue, upon the occurrence of certain conditions, warrants to purchase up to 166,222 shares of Class B common stock.  In September 2016, we issued an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6% Notes to CPPIB.  In August 2017, J.P. Morgan's $75.0 million principal and interest balance associated with the December 2015 issuance and its warrants to purchase up to 146,666 shares of Class B common stock were transferred to CPPIB.  
Each of Alberta, KPCB, NEA and CPPIB are stockholders of the Company that beneficially own greater than 5% of our outstanding Class B common stock.  Such beneficial ownership includes, as applicable, shares issuable upon conversion of the 8% and 6% Notes and shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants.  
We recorded $2.58 million in accrued interest for the 8% Notes and the 6% Notes held by KPCB; $2.58 million in accrued interest for the 8% Notes and the 6% Notes held by NEA and $593K and $3.1 million in accrued interest for the 8% Notes and PPA IIIa, respectively held by Alberta.  The 8% Notes converted to equity at the closing of the IPO on July 27, 2018.  The paid-in-kind interest under the 6% Notes was being paid in-kind on a monthly basis during the period of January 2018 up and through July 2018. Beginning in August 2018, the Company stopped making payments in-kind and switched to making payments for accrued interest in the form of cash payments on a monthly basis.  Thus, as of December 31, 2018, we had $1.5 million, or one month of accrued interest due to 6% Note holders.  As of December 31, 2018, the total debt balance outstanding under the 6% Notes was $13.9 million for KPCB and $13.9 million for NEA.  As of December 31, 2018, the total debt balance outstanding under the 6% Notes held by CPPIB was $239.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, the total debt balance outstanding under PPA IIIa was $40.5 million.

Safeguarding Planet Earth for Future Generations: Our Product is Our Promise
The Bloom Energy Server is the world's most efficient commercially available electric power solution.  Our Energy Servers achieve an industry-leading 60%+ electrical efficiency.  By contrast, the average coal-fired power plant converts only 33% of its energy into electricity.  Importantly, our platform generates electricity without combustion and emits virtually no air pollution.  
We help our customers reduce CO2 emissions by displacing more carbon-intensive grid power.  Today our platform, running on natural gas, produces nearly 60% less carbon emissions compared to the average of U.S. combustion power generation.  Our Energy Servers can also utilize biogas as fuel to generate carbon-neutral electricity. 
Energy generated from traditional power plants can travel hundreds of miles to the end customer, resulting in energy loss averaging 5% in the U.S., and up to 70% in developing economies.  By generating power onsite, Bloom Energy Servers avoid energy losses, further improving emissions reductions.  
To date, we have helped our customers avoid more than 3.5 billion pounds of CO2, equivalent to avoiding the emissions generated by burning 1.7 billion pounds of coal or those generated by an average non-electric passenger vehicle driving 4 billion miles.  
Offsetting the Need for Water-Cooled Power Generation
Thermal power plants require significant amounts of water for cooling.  In fact, the number one use of water in the U.S. is for cooling power plants.  Compared to coal-fired and combined cycle natural gas plants, our Energy Servers require only a small amount of water on startup and consume no water during normal operation.  To produce one megawatt per hour for a year, thermoelectric power generation for the U.S. grid withdraws approximately 156 million gallons of water more than our platform.  Reduced water consumption can benefit local watersheds and avoid thermal pollution in oceans and lakes.
Reuse and Recycling 
Bloom Energy Servers are designed with full product life cycle sustainability in mind.  We maximize the reuse of components within our systems.  End-of-life units are returned back to our manufacturing operation where components are refurbished and reused in the latest generation of our Energy Servers and excess materials are recycled.  Our manufacturing team continues to find innovative ways to refurbish and recycle all materials through the full life cycle of the product.  Our focus is on reducing the generation of any general landfill waste, including packaging wastes of our systems and components.  We work to reduce our cardboard and foam packaging wastes through compaction, recycling and designing new reusable packaging.  Finding innovative ways to reduce, re-use, and recycle reduces our costs and minimizes our impact to the environment.  
Safety in our Operations 
Our management is fully committed to providing a safe working environment. We believe in the principle of 'safety first' and that all incidents are preventable. We foster an environment with ongoing integration of safety into all activities to eliminate illness and injuries.  To achieve this, the Company has established well defined safety, health and environmental policies and procedures and ongoing training. The Company regularly conducts 'Gap Analysis' and develops safety goals and objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for all functional business units of the Company on an annual basis. Leading and lagging indicators are established and monitored to ensure all safety objectives are met and that safety performance is continuously improved. The Company's good safety performance TRIC (Total Recordable Incident Rate) and DART (Days Away from Work, Days of Restricted Work Activity, Days of Jobs Transfer) rates in comparison with similar industries is indicative of its healthy and mature safety culture.

Supporting the Development of the American Manufacturing Sector
True to the intent of successful economic development initiatives, the Company's presence in Delaware has brought some of the most successful and respected manufacturing gurus to the state.  We have implemented their best practices at the Company and shared their expertise with other Delawareans.  Gary Convis is a great example.  Gary was one of Toyota Motor Corporation's foremost lean manufacturing experts and their first non-Japanese Managing Officer in North America. the Company brought Gary to the Delaware Manufacturing Association Conference, which was co-chaired by our Manager of External Affairs, as part of our efforts to help more Delaware manufacturers flourish.  
Supporting Veterans
Our contributions to the local community do not stop with sharing innovation.  Many of the jobs we have created at the Bloom Manufacturing Center Delaware have been filled by former Chrysler and GM workers, Del Tech and University of Delaware graduates, and Delaware active military and veterans.  As a reflection of our support and dedication to Delaware's military community, we were pleased to recently be awarded the Pro Patria award by Employer Support for the Guard & Reserve, our fourth award recognition in as many years.  
Giving Back to Our Communities
Beyond our day-to-day work, we are proud to be active members of our local communities.  Our team members volunteer and provide fresh food from our garden to the Food Bank of Delaware and donate canned goods to San Jose's Second Harvest Food Bank. Last year alone, we donated 824 pounds of food to Second Harvest Food Bank.  
Our India team provided significant support to those affected by devastating floods in Kerala, India, in 2018. In addition to a company donation, our employees made voluntary payroll deductions and donated clothes, blankets, medicines, sanitary and baby products to the Prime Minister's Kerala flood relief fund.
With the environment in mind, our employees also plant trees for the Delaware Nature Society and have supported the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition's Bike to Work initiative for the last eight years.  Our employees also give back by raising money for the American Heart Association, participating in the annual Family Giving Tree, partnering with the Police Athletic League to grow their Science Technology Engineering Arts & Math program for kids, and partnering with Jobs for Delaware Graduates to help ensure graduating students are ready to begin their careers.

The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt a compensation program for directors who are not employees for the Company or directors designated to serve on the Board by investors pursuant to contractual rights ("Qualifying Directors").  In the years proceeding our IPO, our Compensation Committee retained the services of Compensia, an independent compensation consultant, to assist the Compensation Committee in evaluating and refining our Board of Directors compensation program for a Company that was private but planning to go public.  Compensia provided advice regarding, among other things, peer group composition, a competitive market analysis, and equity strategy.  Compensia does not provide any other services to us.  The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Compensia pursuant to the NYSE rules and the Company concluded that the work performed by Compensia for the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflicts of interest.  Based on the recommendation of Compensia, the following standard compensation arrangement for the

Equity Compensation
In 2018, our directors received equity grants that consisted of (i) annual grants of 5,000 RSUs for General Powell and Mr. Zervigon for their continued board service pursuant to our policy (described below), (ii) for Mr. Chambers, an initial grant of 13,333 RSUs upon his appointment to the Board pursuant to our policy (described below), (iii) an additional grant of 2,917 PSUs to Mr. Zervigon for director service in 2017 and (iv) special IPO-related grants to Mr. Chambers, General Powell and Ms. Bush, described below. 
We granted Mr. Chambers a special one-time award of 26,666 RSUs in connection with his joining our board after our IPO, which vested at the expiration of our 180-day lock up period following the IPO.  In addition, we granted each of General Powell and Ms. Bush a special one-time award of  RSUs, which vest as to 25% of the shares on each of January 25, 2019, July 25, 2019, January 25, 2020 and July 25, 2020, subject to the named Director's continued service through the vesting date.  The special IPO grants were intended to reward these directors for all of their work leading up to our IPO and to further align their interests with that of our stockholders by increasing their equity stake in the Company.
Each Qualifying Director appointed to the Board following the date of the Company's IPO will receive 13,333 RSUs which vest annually over three years (the "Initial Awards").  On the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, each Qualifying Director who has been serving on the Board and who will continue to serve on the Board following such annual meeting, will be granted 5,000 RSUs, which vest as to 100% of the shares on the one-year anniversary of the grant date ("Annual Award"); provided, that any Qualifying Director who received an Initial Award shall not be eligible for an Annual Award until the Qualifying Director's Initial Award is fully vested.  
2019 Plans
In order to conform to market practices and reduce year-over-year variability in non-employee director equity compensation, the Board of Directors plans to review its compensation practices now that it is a public company and institute any approved changes beginning with the 2019 Annual Award, which will occur after the 2019 Annual Meeting.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The following is a discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs.  Actual compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion.  As an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act, we are not required to include a Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and have elected to comply with the scaled disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies.  
Overview
Our current executive compensation program is intended to align executive compensation with our business objectives and to enable us to attract, retain and reward executive officers who contribute to our long-term success.  The compensation paid or awarded to our executive officers is generally based on the assessment of each individual's performance compared against the business objectives established for the year as well as our historical compensation practices.  For 2018, the material elements of our executive compensation program were base salary, short-term cash incentives, cash bonuses and equity-based compensation in the form of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs).  
This section provides a discussion of the compensation paid or awarded to our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and our two other most highly compensated executive officers for the year ended December 31, 2018.  We refer to these individuals as our "named executive officers."  For 2018, our named executive officers were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• KR Sridhar, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; 
• Swaminathan Venkataraman, Executive Vice President, Engineering and Chief Technology Officer; and 
• Randy Furr, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.   
[END TABLE]
Executive officer compensation decisions are determined by our Compensation Committee.  Our Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing our general compensation philosophy and setting the compensation levels of each of our executive officers.  Our Compensation Committee has retained the services of Compensia, an independent compensation consultant, to assist the Compensation Committee in evaluating and refining our executive compensation program.  In 2018, Compensia provided advice regarding, among other things, peer group composition, a competitive market analysis, and equity strategy.  Compensia does not provide any other services to us.  The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Compensia pursuant to the NYSE rules and the Company concluded that the work performed by Compensia for the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflicts of interest.  
As a newly public company, we expect that our executive compensation program will evolve to reflect our status as a publicly-traded company, while still supporting our overall business and compensation objectives.  
Compensation of Named Executive Officers
Base Salary
Base salaries are intended to provide a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain an effective management team, when considered in combination with the other components of our executive compensation program.  The relative levels of base salary for our named executive officers are designed to reflect each executive officer's scope of responsibility and accountability with us.   In 2018, our named executive officers each received an increase to their base salary designed to bring his salary to the market median.  The philosophy of our Compensation Committee is to establish base pay at the 50% quartile of our peer group.  Please see the "Salary" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for the base salary amounts received by each named executive officer in 2018.  
28   2019 Proxy Statement
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Non-Equity Incentive Plan
Historically, we have provided our senior leadership team with short-term incentive compensation through our short-term cash incentive plan.  This incentive plan holds executives accountable, rewards the executives based on actual business results and helps create a "pay for performance" culture.  Our short-term incentive plan provides cash incentive award opportunities based on a quantitative assessment by the Compensation Committee of the Company's performance.  
For 2018, this incentive plan provided quarterly and an annual payout based on a pre-established percentage of a participant's base salary.  Payouts under the 2018 short-term incentive plan were based on Company performance against financial and other goals which were established and measured on a quarterly and annual basis.  For 2018, the performance goals related to revenue and operating income.   The determination of the payout percentage under this short-term incentive plan is applied to both payouts for executives, including our named executive officers, as well as to all employees who participate in this incentive plan.  
Please see the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for the amount of short-term incentives paid to each named executive officer with respect to 2018.  
Bonus Program
The Compensation Committee may award spot or other bonuses to reward extraordinary performance, the achievement of corporate goals, retention purposes or for other reasons.  In 2018, Mr. Sridhar was awarded a cash and equity bonus to be payable or become vested upon the achievement of certain corporate initiatives, specifically the consummation of the IPO and  related subsequent milestones.  Mr. Sridhar received $2,000,000 of the $3,000,000 cash bonus opportunity in 2018 as a result of having completed two of the milestones and remains eligible to receive the remaining $1,000,000 of this cash bonus program in 2019.  In addition, Mr. Sridhar received an equity bonus of RSUs.  The Compensation Committee determined the value of Mr. Sridhar's 2018 cash and RSU bonus based on his overall performance and after considering the value of in-the-money stock options held by Mr. Sridhar that were expiring, would not be exercised and would be canceled prior to the Company's IPO.  In recognition of Mr. Venkataraman's outstanding performance and additional responsibilities he assumed over the past three years, Mr. Venkataraman was awarded an equity bonus of RSUs and is eligible for a cash bonus upon the achievement of certain goals relating to his assistance with the transition of certain responsibilities.  Please see the "Bonus" and "Stock Awards" columns in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for the amount of bonuses paid to Mr. Sridhar and Mr. Venkataraman in 2018.  
Equity Compensation
To further align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and to further focus our executive officers on our long-term performance, during 2018, we granted equity compensation in the form of stock options and RSUs relating to our Class B common stock pursuant to our 2012 Stock Plan and our Class A common stock pursuant to our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan.  We believe that both of these elements help support a "pay for performance" culture since stock options only have value if the stock price appreciates from the date of grant and RSUs constitute at-risk compensation since the overall value of the award fluctuates based on our stock price performance.  We encourage our executive officers to own our stock so that they are motivated to maximize our long-term performance and stock value.  To prevent unlawful activity and avoid even the appearance of impropriety, we have adopted a strict Insider Trading Policy which is applicable to our executive officers, as well as our directors, employees and consultants.  This policy requires that our executive officers and other designated insiders only transact in our securities during an open trading window and after obtaining pre-clearance from our General Counsel or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  Further, this policy prohibits engaging in certain short-term or speculative transactions in our securities such as put, calls and short sales.  This policy also prohibits hedging, trading in a margin account or pledging our securities.  
Bloom Energy Corporation   29
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
During 2018, each of the named executive officers received stock option and RSU grants with vesting based on the named executive officer's continued service over the applicable vesting periods, which ranged from one year to five years following the grant date depending on the award.  Further, in 2018, immediately prior to our IPO, we made a special one-time grant of RSUs to certain of our employees, including the named executive officers.  This grant provided us with a market equity employee retention vehicle deemed necessary and in line with our competition for talent in the Silicon Valley.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC require our directors and executive officers to file reports of their ownership and changes in ownership of common stock with the SEC. Based upon a review of filings with the SEC and/or written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that all of our directors and executive officers and, to our knowledge, beneficial owners of more than 10% of our Common Stock complied with the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during 2018, except as set forth below.
Due to an administrative error, a Form 4 with respect to one transaction for each of Ms. Bush, Mr. Doerr and General Powell was filed late. In addition, the Form 3 for Mr. Zervigon failed to report an RSU held by him but has since been corrected.

PROPOSAL 2
PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm and also provided certain tax and other audit-related services as set forth under the caption "Principal Accountant Fees and Services" below.  Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be at the 2019 Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.  
Stockholders are not required to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.  However, we are submitting the appointment for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.  If stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will consider whether or not to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our stockholders' best interests.  
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of Common Stock, present or represented and entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting is required to approve the proposal.  Abstentions have the effect of a vote against the proposal, and broker "non-votes" have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.  
The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee recommend stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

The Committee generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services, and tax services.
