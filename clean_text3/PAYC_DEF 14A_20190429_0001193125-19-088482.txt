About the Annual Meeting 
What is a proxy? 
A proxy is another person that you legally designate to vote your stock. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a "proxy" or a "proxy card." 
What is a proxy statement? 
A proxy statement is a document that we are required to give you under certain regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection with the Annual Meeting. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will act upon the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  the election of three Class III directors, each to serve until the date of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders  and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified, or his earlier death, resignation or removal;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the  year ending December 31, 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  the approval, on an advisory basis, of a stockholder proposal to elect each director annually, if properly presented at  the Annual Meeting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.   
[END TABLE]
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. Similarly, if you are a stockholder of record and also hold shares in a brokerage account, you will receive a proxy card for shares held in your name and a voting instruction card for shares held in "street name." Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
What is the record date and what does it mean? 
The record date to determine the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting is the close of business on March 13, 2019 (the "Record Date"). The Record Date is established by the Board of Directors as required by Delaware law. On the Record Date, 58,475,383 shares of Common Stock (including shares of restricted stock) were outstanding. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Subject to the voting procedures set forth below, holders of Common Stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
What are the voting rights of the stockholders? 
Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock on all matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present or represented at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the Annual Meeting or a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting may adjourn the meeting, without notice other than announcement at the Annual Meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a "street name" holder? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares and we have sent the proxy statement and proxy card directly to you. 
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or held by a bank or other nominee, the broker, bank or other nominee is considered the record holder of those shares. You are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are held in "street name." The proxy statement and proxy card have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee regarding how to vote your shares. See "If I hold my shares in "street name," how do I vote my shares?" 
If I am a stockholder of record, how do I vote my shares? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Common Stock in person at the Annual Meeting or you may vote by proxy. 
In person. To vote in person, you must attend the Annual Meeting and obtain and submit a ballot. The ballot will be provided at the Annual Meeting. We do not require tickets for admission to the Annual Meeting. 
Via the internet. You may vote by proxy via the internet by following the instructions found on the proxy card. 
By telephone. You may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number found on the proxy card. 
By mail. You may vote by proxy by completing, signing, dating and promptly returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope. The proxy card is simple to complete, with specific instructions on the card. 
By completing and submitting the proxy card or by submitting your instructions via the internet or by telephone, you will direct the designated persons (known as "proxies") to vote your shares of Common Stock at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions. The Board of Directors has appointed Chad Richison and Craig Boelte to serve as the proxies for the Annual Meeting. 
Your proxy card will be valid only if you sign, date and return it prior to the Annual Meeting. If you complete the entire proxy card except one or more of the voting instructions, then the designated proxies will vote your shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to each proposal for which you do not provide any voting instructions. We do not anticipate that any other matters will come before the Annual Meeting, but if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, then the designated proxies will vote your shares in accordance with applicable law and their judgment. 
If I hold my shares in "street name," how do I vote my shares? 
If you hold your shares in "street name," your broker, bank or other nominee should provide you with a request for voting instructions along with the proxy materials. By completing the voting instruction card, you may direct your nominee how to vote your shares. If you sign but do not fully complete the voting instruction card, then your nominee may be unable to vote your shares with respect to the proposals for which you provide no voting instructions. Alternatively, if you hold your shares in "street name" and want to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must contact your nominee directly in order to obtain a proxy issued to you by your nominee holder. Note that a broker letter that identifies you as a stockholder is not the same as a nominee-issued proxy. If you fail to bring a nominee-issued proxy to the Annual Meeting, you will not be able to vote your "street name" shares in person at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote if I hold my shares through AST Equity Plan Solutions? 
If you are an employee who holds shares of Common Stock in an account at AST Equity Plan Solutions, including shares purchased through the Paycom Software, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") or shares of Common Stock awarded under the Paycom Software, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") (in either case, "employee shares"), you may cause your employee shares to be voted by (i) accessing the internet website specified on your proxy card, (ii) calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card or (iii) signing and returning your proxy card in the postage-
 paid envelope provided. The transfer agent will then vote your employee shares in accordance with your instructions. Please note that you may receive separate proxy cards for shares purchased through the ESPP and shares awarded under the LTIP. To ensure that all of your employee shares are voted, please complete the voting process (by voting by internet, telephone or mail) with respect to each proxy card that you receive. 
You must provide voting instructions for your employee shares by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 24, 2019. If your instructions with respect to your employee shares are not received by the tabulating agent by such date, the transfer agent will not vote your employee shares. 
Who counts the votes? 
All votes will be tabulated by Mediant Communications, Inc., the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting. Votes for each proposal will be tabulated separately. 
Can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting? 
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares at the Annual Meeting by completing a ballot at the Annual Meeting. 
If you hold your shares in "street name," you may vote your shares in person only if you obtain a proxy issued by your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. 
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also return your proxy card or voting instructions as described above so that your votes will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting or are unable to attend. 
What if I do not specify how I want my shares voted? 
If you are a record holder who returns a signed proxy card that does not specify how you want to vote your shares on one or more proposals, the proxies will vote your shares for each proposal as to which you did not provide any voting instructions, and such shares will be voted in the following manner: 
Proposal 1—FOR the election of each of the Class III director nominees; 
Proposal 2—FOR the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; 
Proposal 3—FOR the advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers; and 
Proposal 4—AGAINST the stockholder proposal to elect each director annually. 
If you are a "street name" holder and do not provide voting instructions on one or more proposals, your broker, bank or other nominee may be unable to vote your shares on all of the proposals other than the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP (Proposal 2). See "What is a broker non-vote?" 
Can I change my vote? 
Yes. If you are a record holder, you may revoke your proxy by any of the following means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Give written notice of revocation, addressed to Matthew Paque, Executive Vice President – Legal and Compliance, at  our address above, which notice must be received before 4:00 p.m. local time on April 26, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Complete and submit a new valid proxy bearing a later date prior to 4:00 p.m. local time on April 26, 2019.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy.  You must vote your shares by ballot at the Annual Meeting to revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If you are a "street name" holder, your broker, bank or other nominee should provide instructions explaining how you may change or revoke your voting instructions. 
How many votes are required to elect the Class III directors (Proposal 1)? 
Assuming the presence of a quorum, the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors is required for the election of the Class III director nominees (i.e., the three individuals who receive the most votes will be elected as Class III directors). 
While directors are elected by a plurality of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, our Corporate Governance Guidelines include a majority voting policy for directors. This policy states that in an uncontested election, any director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" from his or her election than votes "FOR" such election (a "Majority Withheld Vote") is required to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors following certification of the stockholder vote. The nominating and corporate governance committee (or, alternatively, a committee of the independent directors of the Board of Directors if each member of the nominating and corporate governance committee received a Majority Withheld Vote) must recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept the resignation offer. The Board of Directors is required to consider and act on the recommendation within ninety (90) days following certification of the stockholder vote and will promptly disclose its decision whether to accept the resignation offer (and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the resignation offer) in a press release. 
If you withhold authority to vote with respect to the election of a director nominee, your shares will not be voted with respect to such director nominee(s) indicated but your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. Under our majority voting policy for directors, a "WITHHELD" vote will have a similar effect as a vote against that director nominee. 
A complete statement of our majority voting policy is set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines available on our website at investors.paycom.com. 
How many votes are required to approve the other proposals (Proposals 2, 3 and 4)? 
Approval of each other proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. If your shares are represented at the Annual Meeting but you "ABSTAIN" from voting on any of these matters, your shares will be counted as present and entitled to vote on a particular proposal for purposes of establishing a quorum, and the abstention will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal. 
Your votes with respect to the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 3) and the stockholder proposal to elect each director annually (Proposal 4) are advisory, which means the results of such votes are non-binding on us, the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors. 
What is a broker non-vote? 
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are included in the number of shares present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. If you hold your shares in "street name" and you do not instruct your broker how to vote your shares, no votes will be cast on your behalf with respect to any proposal other than the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP (Proposal 2). 
Do I have any dissenters' or appraisal rights with respect to any of the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
No. Delaware law does not provide stockholders any dissenters' or appraisal rights with respect to the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
How are proxies being solicited and what are the costs? Who pays the solicitation costs? 
Proxies are being solicited by the Board of Directors on behalf of the Company. We have retained The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support for a services fee, plus customary disbursements, which are not expected to exceed $15,000 in total. Our officers, directors and employees may also solicit proxies personally or in writing, by telephone, e-mail, or otherwise. These officers and employees will not receive additional compensation but will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses. Brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, in connection with shares of the Common Stock registered in their names, will be asked to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock. We will reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding solicitation materials and collecting voting instructions. 
Are there any other matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting? 
Management does not intend to present any business for a vote at the Annual Meeting other than the matters set forth in the Notice and has no information that others will do so. If other matters requiring a vote of the stockholders properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote the shares represented by the proxies held by them in accordance with applicable law and their judgment on such matters. 
Where can I find voting results? 
We plan to publish the voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which we expect to file with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.

Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
Paycom's business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors, which currently consists of seven directors. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with the members of the classes serving three-year terms that expire in successive years. The terms of office of the current members of our Board of Directors are divided as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the term of office for our Class III directors will expire at the Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the term of office for our Class I directors will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the term of office for our Class II directors will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2021.   
[END TABLE]
Directors hold office until their successors have been elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. The Board of Directors has nominated Jason D. Clark, Henry C. Duques and Chad Richison for election as Class III directors (each, a "Director Nominee" and collectively, the "Director Nominees"), each to serve for a term expiring on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2022 and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified or his earlier death, resignation or removal. Each Director Nominee currently serves on our Board of Directors. 
Vote Required 
Assuming the presence of a quorum, the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors is required for the election of the Class III director nominees (i.e., the three individuals who receive the most votes will be elected as Class III directors). Nonetheless, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, in an uncontested election, any director nominee who receives a Majority Withheld Vote is required to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors following certification of the stockholder vote. The nominating and corporate governance committee (or, alternatively, a committee of the independent directors of the Board of Directors if each member of the nominating and corporate governance committee received a Majority Withheld Vote) must recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept the resignation offer. The Board of Directors is required to consider and act on the recommendation within ninety (90) days following certification of the stockholder vote and will promptly disclose its decision whether to accept the resignation offer (and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the resignation offer) in a press release. Should any Director Nominee become unable or unwilling to accept his nomination or election, the proxy holders may vote the proxies for the election, in his stead, of any other person the Board of Directors may nominate or designate. Each Director Nominee has expressed his intention to serve the entire term for which election is sought. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR each Director Nominee.

Corporate Governance 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors are both appointed by the Board of Directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that both independent and management directors, including the Chief Executive Officer, are eligible for appointment as Chairman of the Board of Directors. We believe it is important that the Board of Directors retain flexibility to determine whether these roles should be separate or combined based upon all relevant facts and circumstances at a given point in time. Currently, Mr. Richison serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. At this time, the Board of Directors believes that combining the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman roles promotes decisive leadership, fosters clear accountability and enhances our ability to communicate our strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders, employees and clients. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the Chairman is not an independent director, the non-management directors are required to appoint a lead independent director to represent and coordinate the activities of the non-management and independent directors and to help ensure the independence of the Board of Directors from the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Mr. Peters currently serves as lead independent director. In his role as lead independent director, Mr. Peters's responsibilities are to (i) preside over regularly scheduled executive sessions of non-management and independent directors, (ii) facilitate communication among the non-management and independent directors, (iii) act as a liaison between the non-management and independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer and (iv) perform such other roles and responsibilities as may be assigned to him by the Board of Directors. 
A copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. 
Board of Directors Meetings 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held four meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings held by the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors for the period for which such director served on the Board of Directors or committee(s), if applicable, during 2018. Other than Mr. Clark, each member of the Board of Directors attended the annual meeting of stockholders in 2018. The Board of Directors does not have a policy requiring director attendance at annual meetings of stockholders. 
Committees 
Our Board of Directors has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The composition and primary responsibilities of each committee are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or death or until otherwise determined by our Board of Directors. 
Audit Committee 
Our audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of our financial statements. In that regard, our audit committee assists board oversight of (i) the integrity of our financial statements, (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) the independent auditor's qualifications and independence and (iv) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors. Among other matters, the audit committee is responsible for (a) the appointment, compensation, retention, oversight and pre-approval of our independent auditors, including oversight of firm and partner rotation, (b) evaluating the qualifications, performance and independence of our independent auditors, (c) reviewing our annual and interim financial statements, (d) discussing press releases, financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies, (e) discussing policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, (f) reviewing and ensuring the adequacy of our internal control systems, (g) reviewing and approving related party transactions and (h) annually reviewing the audit committee charter and the committee's performance. 
Corporate Governance (continued) 
The current members of our audit committee are Ms. Haugen and Messrs. Clark, Duques, Levenson and Peters, with Mr. Peters serving as chairperson of the committee. Each of Ms. Haugen and Mr. Duques was appointed to the audit committee in April 2018. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Haugen and Messrs. Clark, Duques, Levenson and Peters (i) is independent for purposes of serving on the audit committee under applicable SEC rules and regulations and the NYSE Listed Company Manual and (ii) meets the requirements for financial literacy under the NYSE Listed Company Manual and applicable SEC rules and regulations. Our Board of Directors has designated each of Ms. Haugen and Mr. Peters as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined under the applicable SEC rules and determined that each of them has accounting or related financial management expertise as required under the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The audit committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. A copy of the audit committee charter is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the audit committee held six meetings. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other matters, identifying, evaluating and recommending candidates for membership on our Board of Directors, including nominees recommended by stockholders, reviewing and recommending the composition of our committees, overseeing our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines and reporting and making recommendations to our Board of Directors concerning governance matters. The nominating and corporate governance committee also annually reviews the nominating and corporate governance committee charter, the performance of the Board of Directors and management, and its own performance. 
The current members of the nominating and corporate governance committee are Messrs. Levenson, Peters and Watts, with Mr. Levenson serving as chairperson of the committee. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Levenson, Peters and Watts is independent for purposes of serving on the nominating and corporate governance committee under applicable SEC rules and regulations and the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The nominating and corporate governance committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. A copy of the nominating and corporate governance committee charter is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the nominating and corporate governance committee held five meetings. 
Compensation Committee 
Our compensation committee reviews and approves, or recommends that our Board of Directors approve, the compensation of our executive officers. Among other matters, the compensation committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, evaluates the performance of these officers in light of those goals and objectives, approves all equity-related awards to our executive officers, approves and administers incentive-based compensation plans and equity-based compensation plans and reviews and makes recommendations with respect to the annual Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The compensation committee also annually reviews the compensation committee charter and the committee's performance. 
The current members of our compensation committee are Messrs. Clark, Duques and Watts, with Mr. Clark serving as chairperson of the committee. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Clark, Duques and Watts (i) is independent for purposes of serving on the compensation committee under applicable SEC rules and regulations and the NYSE Listed Company Manual and (ii) qualifies as a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The compensation committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. A copy of the compensation committee charter is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the compensation committee held six meetings. 
Corporate Governance (continued) 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, each of Messrs. Clark, Duques and Watts served on the compensation committee. Mr. Clark has served on the compensation committee since August 2016, Mr. Duques has served on the compensation committee since February 2017 and Mr. Watts has served on the compensation committee since December 2017. None of the persons who served on the compensation committee during 2018 is or has been an officer or employee of Paycom and none had any relationship with Paycom or any of its subsidiaries during 2018 that would be required to be disclosed as a transaction with a related person. None of our executive officers currently serves or has in the last completed fiscal year served on the board of directors or compensation or similar committee of another company at any time during which an executive officer of such other company served on our Board of Directors or compensation committee. 
Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the conduct of our business, reviewing and, where appropriate, approving our long-term strategic, financial and organizational goals and plans, and reviewing the performance of our Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. Our Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, is responsible for the oversight of risk management strategy, and our senior management is responsible for assessing, implementing and managing our risk management processes on a day-to-day basis. 
The Board of Directors has delegated primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management to the audit committee, and the audit committee receives appropriate assistance from key members of management, including the Company's Chief Financial Officer. Members of management report regularly to the audit committee. The audit committee periodically discusses with management our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management as well as our significant financial risk exposures and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control such exposures. The audit committee also receives regular reports and updates from the Company's Chief Information Officer with respect to cybersecurity risk management. Such reports cover the Company's information technology security program, including its current status, capabilities, objectives and plans, as well as the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape. Our compensation committee oversees risk related to compensation policies. Both our audit and compensation committees report to the full Board of Directors with respect to these matters, among others. 
Director Qualifications 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things, assisting our Board of Directors in identifying qualified director nominees and recommending nominees to stand for election at each annual meeting of stockholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee's goal is to assemble a board with a wide range of relevant experience, skills and perspectives. In October 2016, the nominating and corporate governance committee approved and adopted a set of criteria and standards for assessing the necessary skills and characteristics of director candidates (the "Director Qualification Standards"). In accordance with the Director Qualification Standards, the nominating and corporate governance committee will select director candidates on the basis of recognized achievements, knowledge, experience and other factors as deemed appropriate, including but not limited to a candidate's (i) ability to bring sound and informed business judgment to the deliberations of the Board of Directors, (ii) character, integrity and loyalty to the Company, (iii) independence, (iv) ability to bring diverse points of view to bear on discussions, (v) financial knowledge and experience and (vi) understanding of marketing, technology, law, the impact of government regulations or other specific areas or disciplines. In connection with the approval and adoption of the Director Qualification Standards, the nominating and corporate governance committee expressly reserved the right to deviate from and/or modify the Director Qualification Standards from time to time in its reasonable discretion. 
While we do not have a formal diversity policy for board membership, the nominating and corporate governance committee endeavors to consider candidates who represent a mix of backgrounds, diversity of race/ethnicity, gender, age, skills and professional experiences that enhance the quality of the deliberations and decisions of the Board of Directors, in the context of the perceived needs of the structure of the Board of Directors at that point in time. The Board of Directors and the nominating and corporate governance committee aim to identify a diverse group of candidates and believe that no single criterion such as gender or minority status is determinative in obtaining diversity on the Board of Directors. 
Corporate Governance (continued) 
Director Nomination Procedures 
With respect to incumbent members of the Board of Directors, the nominating and corporate governance committee will annually evaluate the current members of the Board of Directors whose terms are expiring and who are willing to continue in service against the criteria described above in determining whether to recommend such directors for re-election. 
Director candidates may come to the attention of the nominating and corporate governance committee from current directors, stockholders, officers or other sources. The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews all candidates in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation. In March 2016, the nominating and corporate governance committee adopted a formal policy regarding stockholder nominees. The nominating and corporate governance committee will consider recommendations for the nomination of directors submitted by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. The nominating and corporate governance committee has not established a minimum number of shares of Common Stock that a stockholder must own in order to recommend a director candidate for consideration, or a minimum length of time during which the stockholder must own its shares of Common Stock, but the nominating and corporate governance committee will take into account the size and duration of a recommending stockholder's ownership interest in Paycom. The nominating and corporate governance committee will also consider the extent to which the stockholder making the recommendation intends to maintain its ownership interest in Paycom. The nominating and corporate governance committee will only consider recommendations of nominees who satisfy the minimum qualifications prescribed by the nominating and corporate governance committee for Board of Directors candidates, including that a director must represent the interests of all stockholders and not serve for the purpose of favoring or advancing the interests of any particular stockholder group or other constituency. The nominating and corporate governance committee will only consider recommendations submitted in compliance with our amended and restated bylaws (as the same may be amended from time to time) and any procedural requirements adopted by the nominating and corporate governance committee and disclosed in this proxy statement. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Any stockholder or other interested party who desires to communicate with the Board of Directors, a committee of the Board of Directors, the non-management/independent directors, the lead independent director or other individual director may do so by writing to such director or group of directors at: Paycom Software, Inc., 7501 W. Memorial Road, Oklahoma City, OK 73142, Attn: Legal Department. 
The communication must prominently display the legend "BOARD COMMUNICATION" in order to indicate to the Legal Department that it is a communication for the Board of Directors. Upon receiving such a communication, the Legal Department will promptly forward the communication to the relevant individual or group to which it is addressed. The Board of Directors has requested that certain items that are unrelated to its duties and responsibilities should be excluded, such as spam, junk mail and mass mailings, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, surveys and business solicitations or advertisements. 
The Legal Department will not forward any communication determined in its good faith belief to be frivolous, unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable. The Legal Department will maintain a list of each communication that was not forwarded because it was determined to be frivolous. Such list is delivered to the Board of the Directors at its quarterly meetings. In addition, each communication subject to this policy that was not forwarded because it was determined by the Legal Department to be frivolous is retained in our files and made available at the request of any member of the Board of Directors to whom such communication was addressed. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other principal executive and senior officers responsible for financial reporting. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a "code of ethics," as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. The information contained on, or accessible from, our website is not part of this proxy statement by reference or otherwise. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or waivers of, provisions of our code of ethics on our website. 
Corporate Governance (continued) 
Director Compensation 
Director Compensation in 2018 
In 2018, the compensation package for non-employee directors consisted of (i) annual compensation for service as a director and as a member or chairperson of any committee(s), payable in cash in four quarterly installments (the "Director Cash Compensation"), and (ii) an award under the LTIP of restricted stock with an aggregate fair market value equal to $187,500 (based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant) (the "Director Equity Compensation"). In the event that a new non-employee director was appointed to the Board of Directors other than at an annual meeting of stockholders (a "Mid-Term Director"), such Mid-Term Director was entitled to receive (i) the Director Cash Compensation beginning on the first quarterly payment date following his or her appointment and (ii) a partial award of the Director Equity Compensation on the date of his or her appointment, with the aggregate fair market value of such award to be determined based on the timing of such Mid-Term Director's appointment in relation to the quarterly payment dates for the Director Cash Compensation. All directors are entitled to reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in connection with their service. 
The Director Cash Compensation amounts for 2018 are set forth in the table below.

With respect to Director Equity Compensation, the shares of restricted stock were granted on the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders and are scheduled to cliff-vest on the seventh (7th) day following the first (1st) anniversary of the 2018 annual meeting, provided that the non-employee director is providing services to the Company through the applicable vesting date. 
Corporate Governance (continued) 
The following table provides information regarding compensation paid to each non-employee director during 2018. Because Mr. Richison serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, he did not receive additional compensation for his service as a director in 2018 (including for his service as Chairman of the Board of Directors). See "Compensation of Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016" for additional information regarding the compensation paid to Mr. Richison during 2018. None of our executive officers had a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of compensation paid to members of our Board of Directors.

Director Compensation for 2019 
In December 2018, at the request of the compensation committee, our compensation consultant, Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), evaluated the competitiveness of our existing compensation program for non-employee directors. Specifically, Compensia prepared an analysis of our non-employee director compensation program in comparison to the director compensation programs of the peer group companies selected by the compensation committee. Compensia determined that our average total compensation per director was in the 50th percentile of the peer group. Following its review of the comparative analysis prepared by Compensia, in March 2019, the compensation committee recommended that the Board of Directors approve an increase to the Director Equity Compensation, such that each director will be entitled to receive an award under the LTIP of restricted stock with an aggregate fair market value equal to $225,000 (based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant), which shares shall cliff-vest on the seventh (7th) day following the first (1st) anniversary of the date of such grant. The compensation committee did not recommend any changes with respect to the Director Cash Compensation. 
Corporate Governance (continued) 
A Mid-Term Director will be entitled to receive (i) the Director Cash Compensation beginning on the first quarterly payment date following his or her appointment and (ii) a partial award of the Director Equity Compensation on the date of his or her appointment, with the aggregate fair market value of such award to be determined based on the timing of such Mid-Term Director's appointment in relation to the quarterly payment dates for the Director Cash Compensation. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
To further align their interests with the long-term interests of stockholders and to promote the Company's commitment to sound corporate governance, the Board of Directors established minimum stock ownership guidelines for the non-employee directors and executive officers in October 2017. Under these guidelines, each non-employee director is required to own a number of shares of Common Stock (including unvested shares of restricted stock) equal to (i) three times the amount of annual cash compensation payable to each non-employee director for the then-current year, exclusive of any fees payable for service as lead independent director, chair of a committee or service on a committee, divided by (ii) the greater of (x) the closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date of calculation and (y) the average closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the 12-month period immediately preceding (and ending on the trading date immediately prior to) the date of calculation. Each non-employee director's minimum stock ownership requirement is recalculated annually on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders and in connection with any change in the annual cash compensation payable to non-employee directors. Non-employee directors who were serving on the Board of Directors as of October 31, 2017 are required to achieve compliance with these guidelines by October 31, 2022. Non-employee directors elected since October 31, 2017 and future non-employee directors are required to achieve compliance with these guidelines within five years of their election. As of the Record Date, each non-employee director was in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. A copy of the stock ownership guidelines is available on our website at investors.paycom.com.

[END TABLE]
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying compensation tables, we refer to the executive officers listed above as our named executive officers ("NEOs"). This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides an overview of the elements and philosophy of our executive compensation program as well as how and why the compensation committee and our Board of Directors make specific compensation decisions and policies with respect to the NEOs. 
Executive Summary 
2018 Financial and Business Highlights 
We are committed to achieving long-term, sustainable growth and increasing stockholder value. As evidenced by our strong financial results, our momentum and success continued in 2018. We recognize that our talented and experienced management team is critical to our ability to maintain our momentum and to continue to pursue our strategic objectives. They have been instrumental in our ability to further the innovation of our software and drive client adoption while continuing to make our clients successful in today's rapidly changing business environment. Accordingly, we believe it is important to consider our executive compensation decisions in the context of our financial and operational performance during 2018. 
 2018 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue 31% growth year-over-year Cash from operations $184.8 million (representing 42% growth year-over-year) Stock price 716% increase from the date of our IPO (as of Dec. 31, 2018)   2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS EXPANDING OUR FOOTPRINT Four new sales offices and a new Texas operations center announced INCREASED REVENUE RETENTION Closed 2018 at 92% revenue retention rate (after six consecutive years at 97%) EXPANDING OUR CLIENT BASE Added nearly 3,000 new clients (based on taxpayer identification number) 
We were also encouraged by the results of the stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs held at our 2018 annual meeting. Over 83% of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal were voted in favor of our "say-on-pay" resolution at the 2018 annual meeting. We interpreted this strong level of support as affirmation of the structure of our executive compensation program and our approach to making compensation decisions. As a result, we did not make substantive changes to the program design following the 2018 annual meeting, other than to extend the vesting period for the time-based component of our executive officers' LTIP awards from approximately two years to approximately three years. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Objectives and Components of Compensation 
Our compensation committee has determined what it believes to be the appropriate level and mix of the various compensation components for our NEOs. The specific objectives of our executive compensation program are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward the achievement of our strategic objectives, including financial growth;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• drive the continued development of our successful and profitable business;

• recognize strong performers by offering cash performance-based incentive compensation and equity awards that reward  contributions to our overall success; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders and, in doing so, create value for our stockholders.   
[END TABLE]
The table below summarizes how the various components of our executive compensation program are designed to achieve these objectives.

[END TABLE]
As we pursue our strategic objectives, we must continuously develop and refine our solution to stay ahead of our clients' needs and challenges, which requires a talented and experienced management team. Our compensation committee, with input from management and our compensation consultant, has developed an executive compensation program that we believe is designed to (i) motivate, reward and retain our leaders, (ii) support our strategic objectives, including long-term, sustainable growth and increasing stockholder value, and (iii) encourage strong financial performance on an annual and long-term basis, in each case without encouraging excessive or inappropriate risk taking.

[END TABLE]
Role of Compensation Committee 
Our compensation committee reviews and approves, or recommends that our Board of Directors approve, the compensation of our NEOs. Among other matters, the compensation committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs, evaluates the performance of these officers in light of those goals and objectives, and approves all equity awards to our NEOs. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The compensation committee has engaged Compensia to provide input, analysis, and advice about our compensation programs for executives and non-employee directors, including compensation philosophy and design, peer group data, competitive positioning and equity compensation practices. The compensation committee selected Compensia to provide these services based on, among other things Compensia's reputation and substantial insight and experience with executive compensation programs in our industry. Compensia reports directly to the compensation committee and did not perform work for Paycom in 2018 except under its engagement by the compensation committee. After reviewing and considering the factors set out by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and NYSE regarding the independence of compensation advisors, the compensation committee determined that Compensia is independent and its work in 2018 did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
Role of Executive Officers 
On an annual basis, we evaluate each NEO's performance for the prior year. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Richison, prepares an evaluation of each NEO other than himself, with input from others within the Company. The evaluation focuses on the achievement of stated corporate and individual goals and performance criteria and the amount of contributions made to Paycom. This process leads to a recommendation from the Chief Executive Officer to the compensation committee with respect to the cash compensation of each NEO (other than himself) as well as whether or not equity incentive awards should be granted. The compensation committee determines the Chief Executive Officer's cash compensation (without his input), as well as whether or not equity incentive awards should be granted to him. 
Compensation Mix 
The charts below provide the compensation mix for our NEOs in 2018. As shown in these charts, we emphasize performance-based, at-risk compensation. In 2018, approximately 56% of our Chief Executive Officer's total compensation was tied to performance, including approximately 48% that was delivered in the form of restricted stock that was designed to vest upon our "total enterprise value" reaching certain predetermined thresholds, which we refer to as "market-based" vesting conditions. For information regarding the determination of "total enterprise value," see "—Long-Term Incentive Compensation—Restricted Stock Awards." 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
On average, approximately 50% of the total compensation for each of our other NEOs was tied to performance in 2018, including an average of approximately 39% that was delivered in the form of restricted stock that was subject to market-based vesting conditions. In addition, approximately 34% of the total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and approximately 35% of the total compensation for each of our other NEOs was delivered in the form of restricted stock that is subject to time-based vesting conditions. We anticipate continuing to provide a combination of performance-based and time-based restrictive stock awards to our NEOs. The overall design of our compensation program is intended to support a strong pay-for-performance culture and encourage longevity, sustained performance and retention of our NEOs, resulting in a dynamic compensation mix that aims to ensure alignment between the interests of our NEOs and the interests of our stockholders. 
We do not have a pre-established policy or target for the allocation between cash and non-cash compensation nor for the allocation between short-term and long-term incentive compensation for our NEOs. Rather, the compensation committee relies on each committee member's knowledge and experience, as well as information provided by management and Compensia, to determine the appropriate level and mix of compensation. Ultimately, our objective is to provide our NEOs with reasonable, competitive base salaries and the opportunity to earn additional compensation through short-term and long-term performance-based incentives, which are designed to produce a targeted level of performance. 
Our NEOs receive cash compensation in the form of base salary and bonuses, with bonuses representing a short-term incentive component of our NEO compensation packages. For the majority of our NEOs in 2018, we determined and paid bonuses pursuant to the Paycom Software, Inc. Annual Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the "Annual Incentive Plan"). See "—Cash Compensation—Annual Incentive Plan." Beginning in 2019, all cash bonuses for NEOs will be subject to the Annual Incentive Plan. 
We believe equity awards serve as an important motivational and retentive component of an NEO's overall compensation package. Following our IPO, each of Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York held a significant amount of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting conditions. These shares were issued to replace equity awards that were cancelled in connection with a pre-IPO corporate reorganization. Accordingly, given that a significant portion of our executive officers' restricted stock holdings were subject to time-based vesting conditions, from our IPO until 2017 all equity awards to executive officers were subject to market-based vesting conditions only. As the executive officers' pre-IPO restricted stock awards vested and began to represent a smaller portion of our executive officers' restricted stock holdings, in 2017 the compensation committee added a time-based component to our executive officers' restricted stock awards. In 2018, approximately 43% of the value of the equity awards made to our NEOs consisted of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting conditions. 
Due to the market-based vesting conditions for a majority of the NEOs' equity awards and the performance criteria for Annual Incentive Plan or other bonuses, a significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is linked to our financial and operational performance as well as our enterprise value. We believe this structure challenges our executives to increase stockholder value and compensates them in accordance with the extent that the specified results are achieved. In addition, we believe that the time-based vesting conditions for a portion of our equity awards gives our NEOs an incentive to deliver stockholder value over the long-term and creates an additional immediate alignment with stockholder interests. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Timing 
On an annual basis, our compensation committee reviews and evaluates each NEO's base salary, with input from our Chief Executive Officer (except with respect to his own compensation). Based on historical practices and our performance review cycle for all employees, salary increases, if any, are typically effective as of July 1st of a given year. 
With respect to cash bonuses, the Annual Incentive Plan requires that the compensation committee set performance goals within the first ninety (90) days of a performance period. Following the end of a performance period and our receipt of the independent auditor's report with respect to financial statements for the applicable fiscal year, the compensation committee must certify the extent to which the performance goals were achieved as well as the calculation and determination of the incentive compensation to be paid to each participant under the Annual Incentive Plan. 
With respect to equity compensation, the compensation committee determines whether and when to grant awards to NEOs based on its evaluation of the various factors discussed under "—Long-Term Incentive Compensation—Restricted Stock Awards" below. 
Peer Group Data 
The compensation committee uses peer group data as a point of reference for designing our compensation programs and setting compensation levels. In January 2018, the compensation committee reviewed comparative executive compensation data from a group of companies identified based on the selection criteria described below. The compensation committee does not use peer group data as a single determinative factor, but rather as an external check to verify that our executive compensation programs are reasonable and competitive. 
In developing the peer group, the compensation committee sought to include U.S.-headquartered companies within a similar industry and of a similar size as the Company. In particular, the compensation committee targeted software companies with comparable Software-as-a-Service business models and business software applications. The peer group companies were also identified based on the following financial criteria, with the objective of positioning Paycom approximately at the median of the peer group with respect to market capitalization: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Selection  Criteria          Peer Group Target Financial Criteria      
 Revenue (12-month period)     $200 million—$815 million   
 Market Capitalization     $1.6 billion—$14 billion   
[END TABLE]
Further, the compensation committee targeted companies with high revenue growth. Potential peer group companies were evaluated based on the most recent data available as of December 2017. Companies that did not satisfy all of the selection criteria were nonetheless eligible to be included in the peer group based on alignment across all factors. With the assistance of Compensia, the compensation committee ultimately identified the following peer group, consisting of 19 companies.

Cash Compensation 
Base Salary 
We provide base salaries to our NEOs to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year and to recognize their experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities. During 2018, each of Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York was party to an employment agreement that sets forth a minimum base salary. No formulaic base salary increases are provided to such NEOs pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements. On an annual basis, our compensation committee reviews and evaluates, with input from our Chief Executive Officer (except with respect to his own compensation), the need for adjustment of the base salaries of our NEOs. The table below provides information regarding the base salary for each of our NEOs.

Annual Incentive Plan 
Overview. Our stockholders approved the Annual Incentive Plan at the 2015 annual meeting. The purpose of the Annual Incentive Plan is to advance our interests and the interests of our stockholders by (i) providing certain employees, including the NEOs, with incentive compensation that is tied to the achievement of pre-established, objective performance goals, (ii) identifying and rewarding superior performance and providing competitive compensation to attract, motivate and retain employees who have outstanding skills and abilities, and who achieve superior performance, and (iii) fostering accountability and teamwork throughout Paycom. The Annual Incentive Plan is intended to provide incentive compensation and is intended to comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"). The Annual Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee. 
Participation in the Annual Incentive Plan is limited to those employees who are designated by the compensation committee (or by an officer who is duly authorized by the compensation committee). For each period selected by the compensation committee for payment of incentive compensation, referred to as a "performance period," the compensation committee must (i) approve the participants eligible to receive performance-based awards under the Annual Incentive Plan, (ii) notify (or direct management to notify) each such participant in writing concerning his or her selection, (iii) select performance goals that are to be used for each participant and (iv) establish, in terms of an objective formula or standard for each participant, the amount of each award that may be earned if the threshold, target, and maximum achievement levels for each performance goal are achieved. 
Awards under the Annual Incentive Plan are made based upon achievement of performance goals (consisting of individual performance goals, business unit performance goals, and/or company performance goals) relating to one or more "performance criteria," such as revenues, revenue budget growth, customer growth, earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA (which we define as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
 compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any), loss on early repayment of debt, and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap) and annual revenue retention rate, among others. 
2018 Performance Criteria. For purposes of the performance period that commenced January 1, 2018 and ended December 31, 2018, the compensation committee determined that each of Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York would be eligible to receive performance-based awards under the Annual Incentive Plan. The awards granted under the Annual Incentive Plan for the 2018 performance period were determined based on the Company's achievement of specified revenue goals, but subject to downward adjustment if the Company's adjusted EBITDA fell below a specified target. 
The table below sets forth (i) the revenue amounts and growth rates that were established as the threshold, target and maximum achievement levels for the 2018 performance period and (ii) the payout percentage at each achievement level (the "Revenue Payout Percentage"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Achievement Level       Total Revenues ($MM)         Revenue Growth (2018 vs. 2017)         Revenue Payout Percentage   
   Achievement Level       Total Revenues ($MM)         Revenue Growth (2018 vs. 2017)         Revenue Payout Percentage   
 Threshold  Achievement        433.0               0.0%               0.0%        
 Target  Achievement        542.0               25.2%               100.0%        
 Maximum Achievement        555.0               28.2%               200.0%        
[END TABLE]
The Revenue Payout Percentage was not limited to the specific figures shown in the table above and, to the extent that our total revenues fell between threshold achievement and target achievement, the Revenue Payout Percentage was to be determined on the basis of straight-line interpolation applied on the change in performance between such achievement levels, such that the Revenue Payout Percentage would increase approximately 1.09% for each $1.0 million of revenue growth over $433.0 million of total revenues for the 2018 performance period (i.e., there would be a 100% increase in Revenue Payout Percentage over the $109.0 million interval of revenue growth between threshold achievement and target achievement). To the extent that our total revenues fell between target achievement and maximum achievement, the Revenue Payout Percentage would increase 8.0% for each $1.0 million of revenue growth over $542.0 million, up to $554.0 million, and 4.0% for the $1.0 million increment of revenue between $554.0 million and $555.0 million. 
For the 2018 performance period, the Revenue Payout Percentage was subject to downward adjustment by 5.0% for every $2.0 million (whole) that the Company's adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 fell below $214.0 million, provided that the Revenue Payout Percentage could not be reduced by more than 75.0%. 
In addition to establishing threshold, target and maximum achievement levels, the compensation committee established a target bonus percentage for each participant, which was expressed as a percentage of the participant's base salary. For the 2018 performance period, the compensation committee set the target bonus percentage at 100% for each of Messrs. Richison and Boelte and at 75% for Mr. York. The amount payable to a participant under the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018 was determined by multiplying (i) the Revenue Payout Percentage by (ii) the participant's target bonus percentage by (iii) the participant's base salary. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
2018 Annual Incentive Plan Bonuses. The table below sets forth (i) the potential amounts payable to each of Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York under the Annual Incentive Plan based on achieving the threshold, target or maximum achievement level for the 2018 performance period and (ii) the actual amount paid to each such NEO for the 2018 performance period. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $566.3 million, representing 30.8% growth year-over-year. This revenue growth rate exceeded the maximum achievement level established by the compensation committee for the 2018 performance period and, based on the methodology described above, the Revenue Payout Percentage was 200.0%. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2018 performance period exceeded $214.0 million and, as such, there was no downward adjustment of the Revenue Payout Percentage. We paid cash bonuses under the Annual Incentive Plan for the 2018 performance period in the first quarter of 2019.

The amounts disclosed are approximate. The actual award amounts for Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York will be based on actual performance and will be determined on a scale interpolated between revenue achievement levels, subject to downward adjustment based on our performance relative to a pre-established adjusted EBITDA target. The actual award amounts for Messrs. Smith and Evans will be based on actual annual revenue retention rate and will be determined on a scale interpolated between achievement levels. 
Other 2018 Bonuses 
The 2018 cash bonuses for Messrs. Smith and Evans were determined based on the Company's annual revenue retention rate, which is a metric that tracks the percentage of revenue that we retain from our existing clients. The bonus formulas for Messrs. Smith and Evans were determined prior to their respective appointments as executive officers. The bonus amount that each of Messrs. Smith and Evans was eligible to receive for 2018 was equal to the product of a payout percentage (which was tied to annual revenue retention rate), his target bonus percentage (expressed as a percentage of his base salary) and his base salary. The target bonus percentage for each of Messrs. Smith and Evans for 2018 was 50%. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
 The table below sets forth (i) the annual revenue retention rates that were established as the threshold, target and maximum achievement levels for 2018, (ii) the corresponding payout percentage at each achievement level, (iii) the potential bonus amounts for Messrs. Smith and Evans at each achievement level and (iv) the actual bonuses paid to Messrs. Smith and Evans for 2018.

[END TABLE]
The potential payout percentages for Messrs. Smith and Evans were not limited to the specific figures shown in the table above and, to the extent that annual revenue retention rate fell between threshold achievement and target achievement, or between target achievement and maximum achievement, the payout percentage was to be determined on the basis of straight-line interpolation applied on the change in performance between such achievement levels. For each 1% increase in annual revenue retention rate, the payout percentage would increase 10%. 
The annual revenue retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 92%. Based on the annual revenue retention rate performance goals established at the beginning of 2018, Mr. Smith received a cash bonus of $135,000 and Mr. Evans received a cash bonus of $129,938, in each case paid in the first quarter of 2019. 
Recoupment for Restatements 
The Annual Incentive Plan provides that in the event of a restatement of our financial statements, the compensation committee may recoup all or any portion of any incentive compensation paid under the Annual Incentive Plan to the extent that the amount of the incentive compensation based on such restated financial statements would have been lower. Messrs. Smith's and Evans's 2018 bonuses are subject to similar recoupment (or "clawback") provisions. See "Compensation of Executive Officers—Employment Agreements and Arrangements." 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
Overview 
We believe that equity awards provide our NEOs with a strong link to our performance, create an incentive to achieve long-term performance goals and objectives and more closely align the interests of our NEOs and our stockholders. In 2014, we adopted the LTIP, which allows us to grant an array of equity-based incentive awards to our NEOs and other employees, contractors and outside directors. The purpose of the LTIP is to increase the interests of recipients of awards under the LTIP in our welfare, advance our interests by attracting and retaining qualified employees, outside directors and other persons providing services to us and provide a means through which we may attract able persons as employees, contractors and outside directors. 
Restricted Stock Awards 
Historically, we have granted restricted stock awards to our NEOs under the LTIP. The compensation committee, in consultation with Compensia, determines the timing, number of shares of restricted stock and type of vesting conditions for awards to NEOs based on its evaluation of the following factors, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recent vesting events;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• value of equity awards that have previously vested;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• value of and vesting conditions for unvested equity awards that remain outstanding;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• general market and economic conditions;  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our need to motivate and/or re-incentivize NEOs in light of changes in the  competitive environment; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• trends among our competitors and peers with respect to equity compensation practices.  
[END TABLE]
The compensation committee recognizes that time-based awards are an important retention tool, providing an incentive for our NEOs to stay with Paycom. The compensation committee also believes that restricted stock awards with market-based vesting conditions, which link compensation with the value created for our stockholders, are an essential part of a comprehensive equity compensation package for our NEOs. We believe that the combination of equity awards with market-based and time-based vesting conditions provides a balanced approach to our compensation mix, emphasizing the creation of value for stockholders while also encouraging longevity, sustained performance and retention of our NEOs. 
In connection with a corporate reorganization completed in anticipation of our IPO, outstanding incentive units of Paycom Payroll Holdings, LLC ("ISUs") were cancelled and replaced with shares of restricted stock issued under the LTIP. To replace their ISUs, Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York received shares of restricted stock with market- and time-based vesting conditions. All of the replacement shares that were subject to market-based vesting conditions vested in 2014 and 2015. Each of Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York continued to hold unvested replacement shares that were subject to time-based vesting conditions through late 2018. As of December 31, 2018, all of the replacement shares granted in connection with our corporate reorganization were fully vested. 
Prior to their appointment as executive officers, each of Messrs. Smith and Evans received several LTIP awards consisting of shares of restricted stock subject to time-based and market-based vesting conditions. When Messrs. Smith and Evans were appointed as executive officers in 2018, they each held shares of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting conditions. All shares of restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions granted to Messrs. Smith and Evans prior to their appointment as executive officers have vested. 
From our IPO until 2017, all equity awards granted to executive officers were subject to market-based vesting conditions only. In 2017, as the executive officers' pre-IPO restricted stock awards vested and began to represent a smaller portion of the executive officers' restricted stock holdings, the compensation committee added a time-based component to the executive officers' equity-based compensation. The compensation committee determined that it was appropriate to continue this practice for purposes of 2018 equity awards and, in January 2018, granted shares of restricted stock to the NEOs that were subject to both time-based and market-based vesting conditions. These restricted stock awards are governed by the terms of restricted stock award agreements that set forth the specific vesting conditions and terms regarding delivery of shares of Common Stock underlying the awards. 
Shares subject to time-based vesting conditions represented approximately 43% of the value of the 2018 awards. The time-based shares of restricted stock issued to Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York are scheduled to vest in three equal tranches over a period of approximately three years. The time-based shares of restricted stock issued to Messrs. Evans and Smith, which were granted prior to their appointment as executive officers, are scheduled to vest in four equal tranches over a period of approximately four years. 
Shares subject to market-based vesting conditions represented approximately 57% of the value of the 2018 awards, with 50% of such market-based shares vesting upon the Company's total enterprise value reaching $5.9 billion and the remaining 50% of such market-based shares vesting upon the Company's total enterprise value reaching $6.2 billion. "Total enterprise value" is defined in the restricted stock award agreements and is generally calculated based on the product of the average price of our Common Stock measured over 20 consecutive trading days and the number of shares outstanding (subject to certain adjustments), plus the principal amount of our outstanding funded indebtedness as of a specified date less the aggregate amount of our cash and cash equivalents as of such date. As discussed above in "—Compensation Review and Determination—Compensation Mix," our use of equity awards as part of our performance-based compensation program challenges our executives to increase stockholder value and compensates them to the extent that the specified result is achieved. In March 2018, our total enterprise value reached both of the targets for the market-based restricted stock granted to the NEOs in January 2018. 
Upon a change in control (as defined in the LTIP), 100% of the shares of restricted stock not previously vested will vest if the award is not assumed by the surviving entity. Upon an NEO's termination of service (as defined in the LTIP) as a result of his death or total and permanent disability (as defined in the LTIP), all shares of restricted stock not previously vested 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
 will immediately become vested in full. With respect to Mr. Richison only, if we terminate his employment without cause (as defined in his employment agreement), all unvested shares of restricted stock subject to market-based vesting conditions will remain outstanding and eligible for vesting for one (1) year following such termination of employment, and any shares of restricted stock that do not become vested within the one (1) year period immediately following the termination will be immediately forfeited and will cease to be outstanding. 
Each NEO has all rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to his shares of restricted stock, including the right to vote the shares and the right to receive any dividends thereon. With respect to restricted stock awards granted since 2016, any cash dividends paid with respect to unvested shares of restricted stock will vest as the related restricted stock vests and will be paid to the NEO on the date the related restricted stock becomes vested. 
Insider Trading Policy 
Our insider trading policy includes a prohibition on shorts sales involving our Common Stock and requires that any employee (including the NEOs) or director wishing to enter into any hedging or similar transaction with respect to our securities must pre-clear such transaction with our Chief Financial Officer at least two weeks prior to, and must provide justification for, the proposed transaction. 
Other Compensation Components and Considerations 
Retirement Benefits 
We believe that establishing competitive benefit packages for our employees is an important factor in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. We maintain broad-based benefits that are provided to all employees, including medical, dental, group life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, long- and short-term disability insurance, and a 401(k) plan. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, in each case on the same basis as other employees. The compensation committee in its discretion may revise, amend or add to an NEO's benefits and perquisites if it deems it advisable. 
We maintain a 401(k) plan for our employees. Our 401(k) plan is intended to qualify as a tax-qualified plan under Code Section 401 so that contributions to our 401(k) plan, and income earned on such contributions, are not taxable to participants until withdrawn or distributed from the 401(k) plan. Our 401(k) plan provides that each participant may contribute up to 100% of his or her pre-tax compensation, up to a statutory limit, which was $18,000 for each of 2016 and 2017 and $18,500 for 2018. Participants who are at least 50 years old can also make "catch-up" contributions, which in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 was limited to an additional $6,000 above the statutory limit. Under our 401(k) plan, each employee is fully vested in his or her deferred salary contributions. Employee contributions are held and invested by the plan's trustee, subject to participants' ability to give investment directions by following certain procedures. We provide matching contributions under our 401(k) plan equal to 100% of the first 1% of employees' salary deferrals and 50% of employees' salary deferrals between 2% and 6%, up to a maximum matching contribution of 3.5% of the salary deferrals for our employees. Our 401(k) plan also permits us to make discretionary contributions, and all of our contributions are subject to established limits and a vesting schedule. 
We do not maintain any defined benefit pension plans or any nonqualified deferred compensation plans. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
We provided our NEOs with perquisites and other personal benefits in 2016, 2017 and 2018 that the compensation committee believed were reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program. All of our NEOs are entitled to participate in a supplemental medical plan that provides for visits and benefits with private physicians and health professionals. Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York each receive a monthly automobile allowance. We also pay country club dues on behalf of Mr. Richison. 
Our compensation committee has also authorized personal security services for Mr. Richison. We do not consider these security measures to be a personal benefit, but rather reasonable and necessary expenses for the benefit of Paycom. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
We previously owned a fractional interest in a corporate aircraft. We sold our interest in late 2016 and entered into a leasing arrangement for private air travel. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Richison is entitled to up to 25 hours per year of personal use of a corporate aircraft. Further, to fulfill his duties as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Richison frequently uses the corporate aircraft when he travels on business. Such use of the corporate aircraft enhances Mr. Richison's security and reduces his travel time, which allows him to devote more time to work matters while maintaining the confidentiality of such matters during travel. In light of the increased security and efficiency, we believe such use is appropriate as part of a competitive compensation package. 
On limited occasions, we also allow other NEOs to use the corporate aircraft for business travel. If space allows, we may permit the NEOs to bring family members or guests along on the trip. Because we pay for such business travel based on the flight hours regardless of the passenger load, the aggregate incremental cost to us for the additional passengers is de minimis. 
In December 2018, the compensation committee approved the payment of filing fees and related tax gross-up incurred in connection with filings by Messrs. Richison and York under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"). The HSR Act requires that at any time certain individuals will hold more than a specified amount of value in our stock, those individuals generally must make a filing under the HSR Act, unless the individual immediately exercises and sells the shares or another exception applies. The filings for Messrs. Richison and York were required because, due to stock price appreciation and the acquisition of shares under the LTIP, the dollar value of shares held by Messrs. Richison and York exceeded certain thresholds established under the HSR Act. Without these filings, Messrs. Richison and York would not be able to participate in our LTIP and therefore, the board determined that it was appropriate for the Company to reimburse Messrs. Richison and York for such expenses. 
The compensation committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs. Attributed costs, if any, of the personal benefits described above for the NEOs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are included in the "All Other Compensation" column in "Compensation of Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016." 
Change in Control Arrangements 
The change in control provisions in our employment agreements with certain NEOs are designed to reward executives for remaining employed with us during a time when their prospects for employment following a change in control may be uncertain. We choose to provide change in control protections to incentivize executives to remain focused on stockholders' and clients' interests during the period leading up to, and through, the change in control, and to maintain a stable executive team during the transition process. We believe such provisions are also helpful in retaining executives who may consider opportunities with other companies and may be helpful in the future for purposes of hiring executives from well-compensated positions in other companies. As disclosed under "Compensation of Executive Officers—Employment Agreements and Arrangements," the employment agreements with Messrs. Richison, Boelte and York provide for payments upon the occurrence of a change in control that is followed by a change in the executive officer's status, reporting, duties or position that represents a demotion or diminution from such executive officer's prior status, which is also known as a "double-trigger" provision. The restricted stock award agreements with each NEO provide that upon a change in control (as defined in the LTIP), 100% of the shares of restricted stock not previously vested will vest if the award is not assumed by the surviving entity. Further, the LTIP provides that upon a change in control, we may cancel all awards granted under the LTIP upon (i) notice and a ten (10) day period during which the participant is permitted to purchase such shares of Common Stock subject to such awards or (ii) payment to the holder of an amount equal to a reasonable estimate of the difference between the fair market value of a share of stock underlying such award and the price per share of such award to be paid by the participant, multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board of Directors established minimum stock ownership guidelines for the non-employee directors and executive officers in October 2017. Under these guidelines, each executive officer is required to own a number of shares of Common Stock (including unvested shares of restricted stock) equal to (i) a multiple of his base salary in effect at the time of the calculation, divided by (ii) the greater of (x) the closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on the 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
 trading day immediately preceding the date of calculation and (y) the average closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the NYSE for the 12-month period immediately preceding (and ending on the trading date immediately prior to) the date of calculation. The multiple for the Chief Executive Officer is six times his base salary and the multiple for each other executive officer is three times his base salary. Each executive officer's minimum stock ownership requirement is recalculated annually on July 1st and in connection with any change in the executive officer's base salary. Executive officers who were serving as of October 31, 2017 are required to achieve compliance with these guidelines by October 31, 2022. Executive officers appointed since October 31, 2017 and future executive officers are required to achieve compliance with these guidelines within five years of their appointment. As of the Record Date, each executive officer was in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. A copy of the stock ownership guidelines is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. 
Accounting and Tax Effects 
We consider the impact of accounting treatment in developing and implementing our compensation programs, including the accounting treatment of amounts awarded or paid to our executives. We also consider the impact of federal tax laws on our compensation programs, including the deductibility of compensation paid to the NEOs. Our ability to deduct incentive compensation paid under our incentive plans may be limited by Code Section 162(m) to the extent that the incentive compensation is paid to a "covered employee" (as defined in Code Section 162(m)) and the total compensation paid by us to such covered employee for a taxable year exceeds $1,000,000. This limitation on deductions only applies to compensation paid by a publicly-traded corporation (and not compensation paid by non-corporate entities). Under Code Section 162(m), a "covered employee" includes an individual (or, in certain circumstances, his or her beneficiaries) who, at any time during the taxable year, is our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, an individual who is among the three highest compensated officers for the taxable year (other than an individual who was either our principal executive officer or our principal financial officer at any time during the taxable year), or anyone who was a covered employee for purposes of Code Section 162(m) for any tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even though incentive compensation in excess of $1,000,000, if paid to a covered employee, is no longer tax deductible, the Company intends to continue to grant, when in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, awards that are subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on such review and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition, if the executive officer's employment is terminated by us without cause or by the executive officer with good reason, subject to the execution and return of a release of claims, such executive officer is entitled to (i) continuation of his base salary for the length of the remaining "Restricted Period" following his termination, (ii) continuation of health insurance benefits for the length of the remaining Restricted Period, and (iii) a pro rata amount of the bonus such executive officer would have earned as determined by the compensation committee for the year in which the termination occurred. For purposes of the employment agreements, the "Restricted Period" will end twelve (12) months following the executive officer's date of termination of employment. 
Each of the employment agreements defines "cause" generally as (i) the repeated failure to perform such duties as are lawfully requested by the Chief Executive Officer (or in the case of Mr. Richison, the Board of Directors), (ii) the failure by the executive officer to observe our material policies, (iii) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duties, (iv) the material breach of employment or any non-competition, non-solicitation or similar restrictive agreement, (v) fraud, embezzlement, disloyalty or dishonesty with respect to Paycom, (vi) use of illegal drugs or repetitive abuse of other drugs or alcohol which interferes with the performance of his duties, or (vii) the commission of any felony or of a misdemeanor involving dishonesty, disloyalty or moral turpitude. Each of the employment agreements defines "good reason" as (i) any material reduction by us in the applicable executive officer's base salary without prior consent, (ii) following a change in control, any change in the executive officer's status, reporting, duties or position that represents a demotion or diminution from such executive officer's prior status, or (iii) any material breach by us of the employment agreement between us and the executive officer; provided, that such executive officer will not be deemed to have been terminated for "good reason" unless he delivers written notice to us specifying the alleged "good reason" within thirty (30) days after he learns of the circumstances giving rise to "good reason," within thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice, we have failed to cure such circumstances and the executive officer resigns within fifteen (15) days after the end of the cure period.

     entitled to the amount of incentive compensation payable based on actual results for the 2018 performance period. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Cash Compensation—Annual  Incentive Plan."  
(3)  The Annual Incentive Plan provides that in the event of a change in control (as defined in the Annual Incentive Plan),  we must make a lump-sum cash payment to each participant equal to a pro-rated amount of the incentive compensation payable to such participant, calculated by multiplying  the amount payable for target achievement by the percentage of the performance period completed prior to the change in control. The amount presented reflects the assumption that (i) the change in control occurred on December 31, 2018 and,  as such, the payment would not be subject to such proration, and (ii) the participant would have been entitled to the amount of incentive compensation payable based on actual results for the 2018 performance period. See "Compensation  Discussion and Analysis—Cash Compensation—Annual Incentive Plan."  
(4)  The Annual Incentive Plan provides that if a participant's employment is terminated during a performance period  for any reason other than death or disability, the participant will immediately forfeit any right to receive any incentive compensation for such performance period. If the termination of employment occurs after the performance period has ended but  prior to the date of actual payment, the participant will be entitled to payment of an amount not to exceed the amount set forth according to the terms of his or her award. The amount presented reflects the assumption that the triggering event  occurred on December 31, 2018, which is the end of the performance period, and, as such, the participant would have been entitled to the amount of incentive compensation payable based on actual results for the 2018 performance period. See  "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Cash Compensation—Annual Incentive Plan."  
(5)  Represents the value of the aggregate amount payable for continuation of health insurance benefits for 12 months  following the date of termination of employment, per the terms of the NEO's employment agreement.  
(6)  The applicable restricted stock award agreements provide that unvested shares of restricted stock vest 100% upon the  NEO's death or termination of service as a result of total and permanent disability (as defined in the applicable restricted stock award agreement).  
(7)  The amount presented is calculated based on the assumption that the surviving entity does not assume the obligations  under the equity award.  
(8)  Mr. Richison's restricted stock award agreements provide that upon a termination of service without cause (as  defined in his employment agreement), unvested shares of restricted stock will remain eligible for vesting for a period of one year following such termination. Accordingly, the amount presented includes the value of restricted stock with time-based  vesting conditions that is scheduled to vest before December 31, 2019.  
(9)  All unvested shares of restricted stock would be forfeited on the date of a termination of service by Mr. Richison  for good reason.  
(10)  All unvested shares of restricted stock would be forfeited on the date of a termination of service without cause or by  the NEO for good reason.  
(11)  The applicable restricted stock award agreements provide that unvested shares of restricted stock vest 100% upon the  NEO's death or termination of service as a result of total and permanent disability (as defined in the applicable restricted stock award agreement). The restricted stock award agreements governing the terms of LTIP awards granted to Messrs.  Smith and Evans in 2017 and 2018, prior to their appointment as executive officers, provide that if at any time during the period beginning on the date of termination and ending on the 60th day  following the third anniversary of the termination, the Company determines that the participant breached certain non-solicitation, non-competition, non-disparagement and confidentiality restrictions in the agreement, all awarded shares of restricted stock (whether or not vested and whether then held by the participant) shall be subject to certain forfeiture and  clawback provisons.

Compensation Risk Assessment 
The compensation committee has conducted its annual risk analysis of our compensation policies and practices, and does not believe that our compensation programs encourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking by our executives or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that our compensation policies and practices include an appropriate balance of short- and long-term incentives as well as fixed and variable features. We also believe that we have established reasonable payout scales and performance goals for Annual Incentive Plan awards and reasonable targets for restricted stock with market-based vesting conditions that are related to our enterprise value. We believe that these factors, combined with effective oversight by our Board of Directors, discourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking by executives or other employees with respect to matters that may affect compensation. 
Compensation of Executive Officers (continued) 
Fiscal Year 2018 Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Overview 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Richison. The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with applicable SEC disclosure rules. Because of the estimates and adjustments that may be included in each company's methodology, pay ratio disclosures may involve a degree of imprecision, and the pay ratios reported by other companies are unlikely to be relevant or meaningful for purposes of comparison to our pay ratio disclosure. 
Methodology 
We selected gross wages during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018 as the consistently-applied compensation measure for our pay ratio disclosure. This approach allowed us to include all elements of compensation (such as equity-based compensation, commissions and bonuses) while simplifying the process of gathering relevant information. This method also allowed us to consistently annualize compensation for those full-time, permanent employees whose employment began during 2018. Our employee population consisted of 3,968 employees, all of which are located within the United States. After annualizing gross wages, the wages were ranked from highest to lowest and the median employee was selected from this list. For this selection, we considered the gross wages for all employees, excluding Mr. Richison. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
Using the methodology described above, we determined that the median employee was a full-time, salaried employee. We identified and calculated the elements of the median employee's compensation using the same methodology reflected in the "Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016," resulting in an annualized total compensation for our median employee of $66,625. Based on this information, the 2018 ratio of annual total compensation of Mr. Richison to the median annual total compensation of all employees was 254 to 1. 
Equity Compensation Plan Table 
The following table includes information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2018:

Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
Pursuant to Section 14A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement. The vote on this matter is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the policies and practices described in this proxy statement. 
Our Board of Directors and the compensation committee believe that we maintain a compensation program that is tied to performance, aligns with stockholder interests and merits stockholder support. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement by voting FOR the following resolution: 
"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the stockholders hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the named executive officers of the Company, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion related thereto." 
Although this vote is non-binding, the Board of Directors and the compensation committee value the views of our stockholders and will review the results. If there are a significant number of negative votes, we will take steps to understand those concerns that influenced the vote, and consider them in making future decisions about executive compensation. 
At the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, a majority of our stockholders voted in favor of holding an advisory vote to approve executive compensation every year. The Board of Directors considered these voting results and decided to adopt a policy providing for an annual advisory stockholder vote to approve our executive compensation. The next stockholder advisory vote to approve executive compensation will be held at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required for advisory approval of this proposal. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the compensation of our NEOs, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion following such compensation tables, and the other related disclosures in this proxy statement. 
Proposal 4: Stockholder Proposal to Elect Each Director Annually 
In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth below a stockholder proposal from James McRitchie and Myra K. Young, along with their supporting statement, for which we and the Board of Directors accept no responsibility. James McRitchie and Myra K. Young have notified us that together they are the beneficial owners of no less than 40 shares of Common Stock and intend to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting through their designee, John Chevedden. The address of James McRitchie and Myra K. Young is 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, CA 95758. The stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposal 4 – Elect Each Director Annually 
RESOLVED: Paycom Software, Inc ("Company" or "Paycom") shareholders ask that our Board take the steps necessary to reorganize the Board of Directors into one class with each director subject to election each year. This will not affect the unexpired terms of directors elected prior to the Proposal's implementation. 
Supporting Statement 
Arthur Levitt, former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said, "In my view it's best for the investor if the entire board is elected once a year. Without annual election of each director shareholders have far less control over who represents them." 
In 2010 over 70% of S&P 500 companies had annual election of directors. Now that number stands at 89%. 
Shareholder resolutions on this topic won an average of 86% support in 2018 as of early November. Wins included 96% at Haemonetics, 94% at Hecla Mining, 88.4% at FleetCor Technologies, and 84.4% at lllumina Inc. No shareholder on this topic was recorded as winning less than 67.3% of the vote. That low support was at Axon Enterprise Inc. ISS and Glass Lewis did not recommended against any of these proposals. 
According to one of our largest shareholders; BlackRock, "Directors should be elected annually to discourage entrenchment and allow shareholders sufficient opportunity to exercise their oversight of the board." BlackRock voted for shareholder proposals to declassify boards 6 times out of 6 in 2018, as did Vanguard. 
According to Equilar; "A classified board creates concern among shareholders because poorly performing directors may benefit from an electoral reprieve. Moreover, a fraternal atmosphere may form from a staggered board that favors the interests of management above those of shareholders. Since directors in a declassified board are elected and evaluated each year, declassification promotes responsiveness to shareholder demands and pressures directors to perform to retain their seat. Notably, proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis both support declassified structures." 
This proposal should also be evaluated in the context of our Company's overall corporate governance as of the date of this submission: Paycom retains supermajority voting provisions. Shareholders cannot call special meetings. Shareholders have no right to act by written consent. A plurality vote standard is used to elect directors. The combined effect is to lock the board into an out-dated corporate governance structure and reduce board accountability to shareholders. 
Please vote for: Elect Each Director Annually—Proposal 4 
Paycom Opposition Statement 
The Board of Directors has considered the stockholder proposal and, for the reasons described below, believes that the proposal is not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
Long-Term Focus, Stability and Continuity 
The Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving a three-year term. We believe the longer term encourages our directors to make decisions in the long-term interest of the Company and our stockholders by 
Proposal 4: Stockholder Proposal to Elect Each Director Annually (continued) 
 strengthening the independence of non-employee directors against the short-term focus of certain investors or special interest groups. In contrast, annual election of all directors can, in some cases, lead to short-term focus or a concentration on only immediate results, which can discourage or impair long-term investments, improvements and initiatives. 
The Company's classified board structure also creates stability and continuity on the Board of Directors and ensures that, at any given time, the Board of Directors is comprised of experienced directors who are familiar with our business, strategic goals, history and culture. We believe our current three-year terms are tailored to enable our existing and future directors to develop substantive knowledge about our specific operations and goals, which better positions them to make long-term strategic decisions that are in the best interest of our stockholders. If the Board of Directors were to be declassified, it could be replaced in a single year with directors who are unfamiliar with the Company's business, strategic goals, history and culture. In contrast, a classified board structure allows for orderly change alongside continuity as new directors with fresh perspectives interact and work with experienced directors. 
Protect Stockholder Value 
The Company's classified board reduces the vulnerability of the Company to certain potentially abusive takeover tactics. Because only one-third of the directors are elected at any annual meeting of stockholders, it is impossible to elect an entire new Board of Directors or even a majority of the Board of Directors at a single meeting. Incumbent directors always represent a majority of the Board of Directors and are in a position to negotiate with activists while protecting the interests of all stockholders. 
A classified board does not preclude a takeover, but rather encourages potential acquirers to initiate arms-length negotiations with seasoned directors and provides our Board of Directors with the time and flexibility necessary to evaluate the adequacy and fairness of a proposed offer, consider alternative methods of maximizing stockholder value, protect stockholders against abusive tactics during a takeover process, and, as appropriate, negotiate the best possible return for all stockholders. 
Declassification of our Board of Directors would undercut these benefits and could make us a target for unsolicited hostile overtures from investor groups focusing on short-term financial gains. In particular, in recent years, hedge funds and other activist investors have increasingly used the threat of a proxy fight to pressure boards to take actions that we believe produce short-term gains at the expense of strategies designed to achieve meaningful long-term stockholder value. We believe our classified board structure to be an effective means of protecting long-term stockholder interests against these types of abusive tactics. 
Procedural Matters 
If approved, this proposal would not automatically eliminate the Company's classified board structure. In order to eliminate the classified board, a formal amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws would be required. To amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, (i) the Board of Directors would need to declare the amendment to declassify the Board of Directors to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and (ii) such amendment would need to be submitted to stockholders for approval at a subsequent meeting of stockholders. The approval of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require the affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote. Therefore, a vote in favor of this proposal would constitute a recommendation that the Board of Directors initiate this amendment process. 
After careful consideration of this proposal, the Board of Directors has determined that retention of a classified board structure remains in the best long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Proposal 4: Stockholder Proposal to Elect Each Director Annually (continued) 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required for advisory approval of this proposal. As this is an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on the Company nor the Board of Directors. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal for declassification of the Board of Directors. 
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
Set forth below is a description of transactions since January 1, 2018 in which (i) we have been a participant, (ii) the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or will exceed $120,000 and (iii) any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of such individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
Indemnification of Directors 
We have entered and intend to continue to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors which, subject to certain exceptions, require us to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including indemnification against certain expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines or penalties or other amounts paid in settlement in connection with any legal proceedings to which the director was, or is threatened to be made, a party by reason of the fact that such director is or was our director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent or was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at our express written request, provided that such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner that the director or officer reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interest and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, in a manner in which such person would have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Subject to certain limitations, these indemnification agreements also require us to advance expenses to our directors in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding for which indemnification is required or permitted. 
Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Parties 
We have adopted a formal written policy that our executive officers, directors, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, and any member of the immediate family of, and any entity affiliated with, any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a related party transaction with us, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000, without the prior review and approval of our audit committee. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our audit committee will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the related party transaction and the related party's relationship and interest in the transaction. The transactions with directors described above were either approved or ratified in accordance with the terms of this policy.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Under such rules, a person is generally deemed to beneficially own a security if such person has sole or shared voting or investment power with respect to that security, including with respect to options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. Except as indicated in the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished or available to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock that they beneficially own, subject to community property laws where applicable. 
Applicable percentage ownership is based on 58,475,383 shares of Common Stock outstanding at March 13, 2019, which includes unvested shares of restricted stock.

Other Matters 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the SEC. Our officers, directors and 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports so filed. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports received, we believe that, during the last fiscal year, all filing requirements under Section 16(a) applicable to our officers, directors and 10% stockholders were timely met. 
Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Nominations 
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, some stockholder proposals may be eligible for inclusion in our 2020 proxy statement. In order to be considered for inclusion in our 2020 proxy statement, a stockholder proposal must satisfy the requirements of Rule 14a-8 and be timely received. To be timely, any proposal must be received by us at our principal executive offices at or before the close of business (5:00 p.m. local time) on November 29, 2019. If we hold our next annual meeting of stockholders on a date that is more than 30 days from the anniversary of the Annual Meeting, any stockholder proposal must be received a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. Failure to deliver a proposal in accordance with this procedure may result in the proposal not being deemed timely received. We strongly encourage any stockholder interested in submitting a proposal to consult knowledgeable counsel with regard to the detailed requirements of applicable securities laws. Submitting a stockholder proposal does not guarantee that we will include it in our proxy statement. 
In addition, stockholders wishing to nominate a candidate for election to the Board of Directors or propose any business to be presented directly at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (rather than by inclusion in next year's proxy statement) must follow the submission criteria and deadlines set forth in our amended and restated bylaws. Pursuant to the advance notice provisions of the amended and restated bylaws, we must receive notice at our principal executive offices of any nomination or stockholder proposal to be presented directly at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders no earlier than the close of business on December 30, 2019 and no later than the close of business on January 29, 2020. If the date of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days before or 70 days after the one year anniversary of the Annual Meeting, such nomination or proposal must be received on or before the later of (i) the close of business on the 90th day prior to the 2020 annual meeting and (ii) the close of business on the 10th day following the date of public disclosure of the 2020 annual meeting date. In each case, the notice must include the information specified in our amended and restated bylaws. We will not entertain any nominations or proposals that do not meet the requirements set forth in our amended and restated bylaws. To request a copy of our amended and restated bylaws, stockholders should contact Investor Relations. See "—Additional Information." We strongly encourage stockholders to seek advice from knowledgeable counsel before submitting a nomination or proposal. 
Other Business 
The Board of Directors knows of no other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting. If, however, any other business should properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote the proxy in accordance with applicable law and as they may deem appropriate in their discretion, unless directed by the proxy to do otherwise. 
Financial Statements 
A copy of the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019 is contained within the 2018 Annual Report delivered with this proxy statement. The Form 10-K includes our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Copies of the Form 10-K and 2018 Annual Report are also posted on our website at investors.paycom.com. If you have not received or do not have access to the 2018 Annual Report, please contact our Investor Relations department at (855) 603-1620 or investors@paycom.com and we will send a copy to you without charge. You may also send a written request to Paycom Software, Inc., Attn: Investor Relations, 7501 W. Memorial Road, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73142.
