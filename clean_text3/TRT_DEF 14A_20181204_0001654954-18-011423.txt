PROXY STATEMENT
 FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
 OF
 TRIO-TECH INTERNATIONAL
 To Be Held on December 4, 2018
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of the enclosed Proxy on behalf of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Trio-Tech International, a California corporation ("Trio-Tech" or the "Company"), for use at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at our principal executive offices, located at 16139 Wyandotte Street, Van Nuys, California 91406, on Tuesday, December 4, 2018 at 10:00 A.M. local time, for the purposes of electing directors and such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting. For directions to our principal executive offices, please call our executive offices at 818-787-7000. This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card are intended to be electronically available to shareholders on or about October 25, 2018.
 Record Date and Voting Securities
The Board of Directors fixed the close of business on October 8, 2018 as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of that date, there were 3,608,055 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") outstanding and entitled to vote, the holders of which are entitled to one vote per share.
 Voting Generally
The presence in person or by proxy of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Because a shareholder's broker may not vote on behalf of the shareholder on the election of directors unless the shareholder provides specific instructions by completing and returning the voting instruction form, for a shareholder's vote to be counted, we ask that our shareholders communicate their voting decisions to the broker or other nominee before the date of the Annual Meeting or give a proxy to vote their shares at the meeting.
In the election of directors, a shareholder may cumulate his/her votes for one or more candidates, but only if each such candidate's name has been placed in nomination prior to the voting and the shareholder has given notice at the meeting, prior to the voting, of his intention to cumulate his votes. If any shareholder has given such notice, all shareholders may cumulate their votes for the candidates in nomination. If the voting for directors is conducted by cumulative voting, each share will be entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected. These votes may be cast for a single candidate or may be distributed among two or more candidates in such proportions as the shareholder thinks fit. The five candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but votes against a candidate or withheld from voting (whether by abstention, broker non-votes or otherwise) will not be counted and will have no legal effect on the vote. Discretionary authority to cumulate votes is solicited hereby.
 Deadline for Voting by Proxy
In order to be counted, votes cast by proxy must be received prior to the Annual Meeting.
 Revocability of Proxies
Any Proxy given may be revoked by the shareholder at any time before it is voted by delivering written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company, by filing with the Secretary of the Company a Proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. All Proxies properly executed and returned will be voted in accordance with the instructions specified thereon. If no instructions are specified, Proxies will be voted FOR the election of the five nominees for directors named under "Election of Directors" (Proposal 1).

 PROPOSAL 1
 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 Information With Respect to Directors
A majority of the independent directors of our Board has nominated the persons listed below for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting, to hold office until the next Annual Meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. There is one vacancy on the Board of Directors. The Board does not intend to fill the vacancy at this time due to the costs associated therewith. It is intended that the Proxies received, unless otherwise specified, will be votedFORthe five nominees named below, all of whom are incumbent directors of the Company and, with the exception of Mr. Yong and Mr. Ting, are "independent" as specified in Section 803 of the NYSE MKT rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). It is not contemplated that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director but, if that should occur, the persons designated as proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment. In no event will Proxies be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in this Proxy Statement. The following chart and accompanying narrative set forth, as of October 8, 2018, the names of each of the five nominees for election as a director, his principal occupation, age, the year he became a director of the Company, and additional biographical data.

In determining that Mr. Wilson should serve on the Company's Board of Directors, the Board has considered, among other qualifications, his professional background and experience, his leadership skills as a result of his ten years serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, his service as a Chairman on other corporate boards and his broad range of knowledge of the Company's history and business through his 52 years of service as a director of the Company.

The proceeding was wholly unrelated to the Company's business and was settled in March 2014 without requiring Mr. Horowitz to admit to any of the allegations.  The Board believes that the proceeding and the actions alleged thereunder do not impair upon Mr. Horowitz's ability or integrity as a director of the Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
 Corporate Governance Program
Our Board of Directors has established a written Corporate Governance Program to address significant corporate governance issues that may arise. It sets forth the responsibilities and qualification standards of the members of the Board of Directors and is intended as a governance framework within which the Board of Directors, assisted by its committees, directs our affairs.
 Code of Ethics
The Company has adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics applicable to all directors, officers, management and employees and a separate code of ethics applicable to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.  A copy of the Company's code of business conduct and ethics and code of ethics may be obtained, without charge, upon written request to the Secretary of the Company at 16139 Wyandotte Street, Van Nuys, California 91406.
 Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors believes it is important to select its Chairman and the Company's Chief Executive Officer in the manner it considers in the best interests of the Company at any given point in time. The Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Company are held by separate persons as an aid in the Board's oversight of management. The duties of the non-executive Chairman of the Board include:
 presiding over all meetings of the Board;
 preparing the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the CEO and other members of the Board;
 calling and presiding over meetings of the independent directors;
 managing the Board's process for annual director self-assessment and evaluation of the Board and of the CEO; and
 presiding over all meetings of shareholders.
The Board believes that there may be advantages to having an independent chairman for matters such as communications and relations between the Board, the CEO, and other senior management; assisting the Board in reaching consensus on particular strategies and policies; and facilitating robust director, Board, and CEO evaluation processes.
 Risk Management
The Chief Executive Officer and senior management are primarily responsible for identifying and managing the risks facing the Company, and the Board of Directors oversees these efforts. The Chief Executive Officer and senior management report to the Board of Directors regarding any risks identified and steps it is taking to manage those risks. In addition, the Audit Committee identifies, monitors and analyzes the priority of financial risks, and reports to the Board of Directors regarding its financial risk assessments.
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
The Board's Audit Committee is responsible for review, approval, or ratification of "related-person transactions" between the Company or its subsidiaries and related persons. Under SEC rules, a related person is a director, officer, nominee for director, or 5% shareholder of the Company and their immediate family members. The Company's code of business conduct and ethics provides guidance to the Audit Committee for addressing actual or potential conflicts of interests that may arise from transactions and relationships between the Company and its executive officers or directors.  Potential conflicts relating to other personnel must be addressed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer. There were no related party transactions during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for which disclosure would be required under SEC rules.
-4-
BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES
The Board held four regularly scheduled and special meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. All of the directors attended (in person or by telephone) at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and any committees of the Board on which they served during the last full fiscal year. Directors are expected to use their best efforts to be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All of our directors attended the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on December 4, 2017.
The Company does not have a standing nominating committee. The Board consists of five directors, three of whom are "independent" (as defined under the rules of the NYSE MKT upon which the Company's securities are listed), namely Jason T. Adelman, Richard M. Horowitz and A. Charles Wilson. Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board, a majority of the independent directors, following a discussion with the entire Board, has the sole and ultimate responsibility to determine and nominate Board candidates for election at the Annual Meeting. Although nominations are made by a majority of the independent directors, the three current independent directors value the input of the entire Board and thus discuss proposed nominees at the Board level before the ultimate nomination determinations are made by the independent directors. The Board does not believe that it is necessary, at this time, given the Board composition and such Board resolution, to have a separately constituted nominating committee. At such time as the Board composition changes, the Board may elect to establish a separate nominating committee.
The Board has also adopted a resolution addressing the nomination process and related matters and it states, among other things, that the Board believes that the continuing service of qualified incumbents promotes stability and continuity in the boardroom, contributing to the Board's ability to work as a collective body, while giving the Company the benefit of the familiarity and insight into the Company's affairs that its directors have accumulated during their tenure. The resolution further states that the Board will evaluate the performance of its Board members on an annual basis in connection with the nomination process. The Board may solicit recommendations for nominees from persons that the Board believes are likely to be familiar with qualified candidates, including without limitation members of the Board and management of the Company. The Board may also determine to engage a professional search firm to assist in identifying qualified candidates if the need arises. In addition, the Board has the authority to retain third-party consultants to provide advice regarding compensation issues. The Board has not adopted specific minimum qualifications for a position on the Company's Board or any specific skills or qualities that the Board believes are necessary for one or more of its members to possess. However, the Board will consider various factors including without limitation the candidate's qualifications, the extent to which the membership of the candidate on the Board will promote diversity among the directors, and such other factors as the Board may deem to be relevant at the time and under the then existing facts and circumstances. The Company does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying nominees for director. The Board of Directors seeks to nominate directors with a variety of skills and experience so that the Board will have the necessary expertise to oversee the Company's business. The Company did not receive any recommendations as to nominees for election of directors for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on December 4, 2018.
The Board will consider candidates proposed by shareholders of the Company and will evaluate all such candidates upon criteria similar to the criteria used by the Board to evaluate other candidates. Shareholders desiring to propose a nominee for election to the Board must do so in writing sufficiently in advance of an annual meeting so that the Board has the opportunity to make an appropriate evaluation of such candidate and his or her qualifications and skills and to obtain information necessary for preparing all of the disclosures required to be included in the Company's proxy statement for the related meeting should such proposed candidate be nominated for election by shareholders. Shareholder candidate proposals should be sent to the attention of the Secretary of the Company at 16139 Wyandotte Street, Van Nuys, California 91406.
The Board has a standing Compensation Committee, which currently consists of the three independent directors, namely Jason T. Adelman, Richard M. Horowitz and A. Charles Wilson, Chairman. The Compensation Committee determines salary and bonus arrangements. The Compensation Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Compensation Committee has a written charter. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee did not retain a third-party consultant to review the Company's current policies and procedures with respect to executive compensation.
-5-
The Board has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The members thereof consist of Jason T. Adelman, Richard M. Horowitz and A. Charles Wilson, Chairman. The Board of Directors has determined that the Audit Committee has at least one financial expert, namely A. Charles Wilson. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Mr. Wilson does not have a material relationship with the Company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment and is "independent" as independence is defined in Section 803 of the rules of the NYSE MKT. Pursuant to its written charter, which charter was adopted by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee is charged with, among other responsibilities, selecting our independent public accountants, reviewing our annual audit and meeting with our independent public accountants to review planned audit procedures. The Audit Committee also reviews with the independent public accountants and management the results of the audit, including any recommendations of the independent public accountants for improvements in accounting procedures and internal controls. The Audit Committee held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Each of the members of the Audit Committee satisfies the independence standards specified in Section 803 of the rules of the NYSE MKT and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION
Our directors play a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and overseeing our management. In order to compensate them for their substantial time commitment, we provide a mix of cash and equity-based compensation. We do not provide pension or retirement plans for non-employee directors. Our employee directors, S.W. Yong and Victor Ting, do not receive separate compensation for Board service.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Richard M. Horowitz and Jason T. Adelman, as non-employee directors, received quarterly fees in an amount equal to $7,812 for each quarter and for service on the various committees of which they are a member. A. Charles Wilson, as a non-employee director, Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Chairman of the Compensation Committee, received $16,375 in quarterly fees for each quarter and for service on the various committees of which he is a member. The directors were also reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings.
Each of our directors is entitled to participate in our 2017 Directors Equity Incentive Plan ("2017 Directors Plan"). Messrs. Yong and Ting, as employees of the Company, are also entitled to participate in our 2017 Employee Stock Option Plan ("2017 Employee Plan"). On March 23, 2018, pursuant to the 2017 Directors Plan, Mr. Wilson was granted an option to purchase 40,000 shares, and Messrs. Horowitz and Adelman each were granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.98 per share. Each such option vested immediately upon grant and will terminate five years from the date of grant unless terminated sooner upon termination of the optionee's status as a director or otherwise pursuant to the 2017 Directors Plan.   The exercise price under the options was set at 100% of fair market value (as defined in the 2017 Directors Plan) of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant of each such option.
                As of June 30, 2018, there were 220,000 shares available for grant under the 2017 Directors Plan and 240,000 shares under the 2017 Employee Plan.
The Compensation Committee reviewed the average directors' fees for comparable public companies. The Compensation Committee believes that the director fees paid to its directors were and are substantially less than the fees paid to directors of comparable public companies. Directors' compensation may be increased based on the profitability of the Company.
The following table contains information on compensation for our non-employee members of our Board of Directors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

The purpose of these two plans is also to enable the Company to attract and retain top-quality employees, officers, directors and consultants and to provide them with an incentive to enhance shareholder return as well as contributing to the Company's long-term growth and profitability objectives.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
 The Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relating to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer; reviews goals and objectives of other executive officers; establishes the performance criteria (including both long-term and short-term goals) to be considered in light of those goals and objectives; evaluates the performance of the executives; determines and approves the compensation level for the Chief Executive Officer; and reviews and approves compensation levels of other key executive officers.
 Compensation Objectives
The Company operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry. The key objectives of the Company's executive compensation programs are to:
 attract, motivate and retain executives who drive Trio-Tech's success and industry leadership;
 provide each executive, from Vice-President to Chief Executive Officer, with a base salary based on the market value of that role, and the individual's demonstrated ability to perform that role;
 motivate executives to create sustained shareholder value by ensuring all executives have an "at risk" component of total compensation that reflects their ability to influence business outcomes and financial performance.
 What Our Compensation Program is Designed to Reward  
Our compensation program is designed to reward each individual executive officer's contribution to the advancement of the Company's overall performance and execution of our goals, ideas and objectives. It is designed to reward and encourage exceptional performance at the individual level in the areas of organization, creativity and responsibility while supporting the Company's core values and ambitions. This in turn aligns the interest of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, and thus with the interests of the Company.
 Determining Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation program for executive officers annually after the closing of each fiscal year. Reviewing the compensation program at such time allows the Compensation Committee to consider the overall performance of the past fiscal year and the financial and operating plans for the upcoming fiscal year in determining the compensation program for the upcoming fiscal year.
The Compensation Committee also annually reviews market compensation levels with comparable jobs in the industry to determine whether the total compensation for our officers remains in the targeted median pay range. This assessment includes evaluation of base salary, annual incentive opportunities, and long-term incentives for the key executive officers of the Company. The Company did not hire any compensation consultants in connection with setting executive compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
The Compensation Committee's compensation decisions are based on the Company's operation performance, the performance and contribution of each individual officer, and the compensation budget and objectives of the Company. The Compensation Committee also considers other factors, such as the experience and potential of the officer and the market compensation level for a similar position.

 Role of Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation
        The Compensation Committee determines compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, which is based on different factors, such as level of responsibility and contributions to the performance of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer recommends the compensation for the Company's executive officers (other than the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer) to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews the recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer and determines the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers. The Chief Executive Officer is not present during voting on, or deliberations concerning, his compensation.
 Components of Executive Compensation
The Company's compensation program has three major components: (1) base annual salary; (2) potential annual cash incentive awards that are based primarily on financial performance of the Company or its relevant business operating units; and (3) long-term incentive compensation in the form of stock options.
 Base Salary
Base salaries are provided as compensation for day-to-day responsibilities and services to the Company and to meet the objective of attracting and retaining the talent needed to run the business.
Base salary for our executive officers was determined utilizing various factors.
One factor that was taken into account in determining base salary for our executive officers was the compensation policies of other companies comparable in size to and within substantially the same industry as Trio-Tech. Keeping our executive officers' salaries in line with the market ensures the Company's competitiveness in the marketplace in which the Company competes for talent.
Another factor taken into account in determining base salary for our executive officers was salaries paid by us to our executive officers during the immediately preceding year and increases in the cost of living.
The Compensation Committee will review the Company's financial condition, macroeconomic conditions and adjust base salaries at least quarterly in order to ascertain the appropriate time to restore base salaries to pre-reduction levels.
The salary for each of our Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and the percentage increase in their salary from the prior fiscal year's salary were as follows:

 Hwee Poh Lim,  Corporate Vice President-Testing    $97,191      4.01%  
[END TABLE]

Percent increase is based on the increase in base salary in the currency of Singapore. The appreciation of Singapore dollars against U.S. dollars is excluded in the calculation. The base cash compensation for the above named officers of the Company, each of whom resides in Singapore, in fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, was denominated in the currency of Singapore. The exchange rate therefore was established as of June 30, 2018 and was computed to be 1.3421 Singapore dollars to each U.S. dollar.
Singapore executive officers' base salaries are credited with a compulsory contribution ranging from 2.8% to 10.6% of base salary as required under Singapore's provident pension fund.
 Bonuses
In November 2016, The Compensation Committee approved the bonus formulae for Company's executive officers, as intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.

The bonus for each of our Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was as follows:

 Hwee Poh Lim,  Corporate Vice President-Testing    $30,574   
[END TABLE]
 Option Grants
Stock options are intended to align the interests of key executives and shareholders by placing a portion of the key executives' compensation at risk, tied to long-term shareholder value creation. Stock options are granted at 100% of the "fair market value" (as defined under the applicable plan) of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant. The Compensation Committee believes that stock options are flexible and relatively inexpensive to implement when compared with cash bonuses. It also has no negative impact on the Company's cash flow. The Compensation Committee believes that long-term incentives in the form of stock options can better encourage the executive officers to improve operations and increase profits for the Company through participation in the growth in value of the Company's Common Stock.
The Compensation Committee views any option grant portion of our executive officer compensation packages as a special form of long-term incentive compensation to be awarded on a limited and non-regular basis. The objective of these awards is to ensure that the interests of our executives are closely aligned with those of our shareholders. These awards provide rewards to our executive officers based upon the creation of incremental shareholder value and the attainment of long-term financial goals. Stock options produce value to our executive officers only if the price of our stock appreciates, thereby directly linking the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders.
Awards of stock options are determined based on the Compensation Committee's subjective determination of the amount of awards necessary, as a supplement to an executive officer's base salary, to retain and motivate the executive officer.
In fiscal year 2018, we granted the following stock options covering the following officers pursuant to the 2007 Directors Plan, 2017 Directors Plan, 2007 Employee Plan and 2017 Employee Plan as indicated below.

At the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company's shareholders voted to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation on an "every one year" basis. The Board of Directors had recommended in the proxy statement for the 2013 Annual Meeting a vote for the "every three years" option. The Board of Directors had made such recommendation based on its conclusion that an advisory vote at such frequency would provide the Company's shareholders with sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of its overall compensation philosophy, policies and practices in the context of the Company's long-term business results, while avoiding more emphasis on short term variations in compensation and business results.  Therefore, the Board decided to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation on an "every three years" basis until at least the next vote by the Company's shareholders on the frequency of such votes, which will be no later than the Annual Meeting to be held in 2019.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Audit Committee fulfilled its duties and responsibilities as outlined in its charter. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the independent auditor's report on those financial statements, with the Company's management and Mazars LLP ("Mazars"), the Company's independent auditor. Management presented to the Audit Committee that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee has discussed with Mazars the matters required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU Section 380) as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee's review included a discussion with management and the independent auditor of the quality (not merely the acceptability) of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in the Company's financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies.
The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of the Company's independent auditor, both in fact and appearance. The Audit Committee has evaluated Mazars's qualifications, performance, and independence, including that of the lead audit partner. As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy pursuant to which all services, audit and non-audit, provided by the independent auditor must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its delegate. The Company's pre-approval policy is more fully described in this Proxy Statement under the caption "Policy for pre-approval of audit and non-audit services." The Audit Committee has concluded that provision of the non-audit services described in that section is compatible with maintaining the independence of Mazars. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosure and the letter from Mazars required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Mazars' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with Mazars its independence.
Based on the above-described review, written disclosures, letter and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors of the Company that the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Tax Fees
The amounts set forth opposite "Tax Fees" above reflect the aggregate fees billed for fiscal 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered for tax compliance and return preparation. The compliance and return preparation services consisted of the preparation of original and amended tax returns and support during the income tax audit or inquiries.
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit services and all non-audit services that our independent accountants are permitted to perform for us under applicable federal securities regulations. The Audit Committee's policy utilizes an annual review and general pre-approval of certain categories of specified services that may be provided by the independent accountant, up to pre-determined fee levels. Any proposed services not qualifying as a pre-approved specified service, and pre-approved services exceeding the pre-determined fee levels, require further specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Committee the authority to pre-approve audit and non-audit services proposed to be performed by the independent accountants. Since June 30, 2004, all services provided by our auditors require pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The policy has not been waived in any instance.
