Executive Officer
Dear Shareholder,
We are pleased to invite you to attend our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on
April 25 at 8:30am PDT to share our growth strategies and vision on how we will continue to create personal transportation solutions wherever, whenever and however our consumers desire.
Our mission, Growth Powered by People, focuses on our customers and team to create our competitive advantage. We are fortunate to lead such a talented and engaged group of people committed to modernizing automotive retail through innovation and personalized experiences.
We will continue to expand our value-based growth strategy that targets strong franchised stores that have not realized their potential. By unlocking the vertical and horizontal adjacencies created by the scale of our core business we will further activate and grow our nationwide network.
Our entrepreneurial culture inspires leaders to test and tailor solutions to their local markets providing a diverse range of consumer offerings. These solutions are underpinned by world class performance management systems that assist in managing results to drive profits upward.
We're passionate about cars and the relationships we have built with our customers, team members and the communities we serve. We hope you share our enthusiasm during this exciting time in our industry. We have a winning combination of high profitability, a strategic acquisition model, organic growth opportunity, a well-positioned balance sheet and an amazing team. Together these strengths will enable us to capture a significant portion of the U.S. market.
Thank you very much for being a partner and a shareholder in our company.

For a quorum to exist at the Annual Meeting, there must be represented, in person or by proxy, shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting. Proxies that expressly abstain from voting on a particular proposal and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the Annual Meeting.

Proxies that expressly abstain from voting on a particular proposal and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the Annual Meeting. 
How do we count votes?  The proxy holders will vote your shares as you instruct.  We will not count abstentions or broker non-votes either "for" or "against" a "non-routine" matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other holder of record, such as a bank, submits a proxy representing shares that another person beneficially owns, and that person has not given voting instructions to the broker or other nominee. A broker may only vote shares on a non-routine matter if the beneficial owner gives the broker voting instructions. Only the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 is considered a routine matter on which a broker or nominee that holds shares in its name may vote without instruction from the person that owns the shares beneficially.

See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below for a discussion of our compensation philosophy and how the Compensation Committee determines the compensation of our executive officers.
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting and hiring our independent registered public accounting firm and for overseeing our accounting functions, systems of internal control established by management and processes to assure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and internal policies. The Audit Committee routinely meets in executive session with each of representatives from KPMG, our Chief Financial Officer and our Director of Internal Audit. Our Director of Internal Audit reports directly to the chair of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee held 5 meetings during 2018. In addition to meeting the independence requirement for audit committee members, each current member of the Audit Committee also meets the financial literacy and experience requirements contained in the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE. Our Board has reviewed the qualifications and experience of the nominees standing for election and has determined that both Ms. Cain and Mr. Miramontes satisfy the requirements of an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules.
THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for assisting our Board of Directors in identifying qualified individuals to become Board members and recommending to our Board of Directors nominees for each annual meeting of the shareholders; determining the composition of our Board of Directors and its committees; developing and implementing a set of effective corporate governance policies and procedures; developing and enforcing a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; monitoring a process to assess the effectiveness of our Board of Directors, its members and its committees; and ensuring our compliance with NYSE listing standards. The Nominating and Governance Committee held 5 meetings in 2018.

Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require our board to be composed of a majority of independent directors. Generally, under NYSE listing standards, a director is not independent if he or she has a direct or indirect material relationship with Lithia or its management. In accordance with its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews the independence of all non-employee director nominees and reports its findings to the full Board of Directors, which makes a determination about the independence of each nominee. The Board of Directors and the Nominating and Governance Committee review and discuss all transactions and relationships between each director nominee or any member of his or her immediate family and Lithia, its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, and management, both in the context of the specific independence standards enumerated in the NYSE listing standards, as well as other business and personal relationships that could compromise the independent judgment of a director. Other than the NYSE listing standards, we do not adhere to categorical standards for determining independence; rather, we review and evaluate the specific facts and circumstances of each transaction and relationship to determine whether the director is independent. As a result of this review, our Board of Directors affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Cain and Ms. McIntyre and Messrs. Becker, Miramontes, Roberts and Robino is independent under NYSE listing standards.
Lead Independent Director and Leadership Structure
Lithia's governance documents provide our Board with flexibility to select the leadership structure that is best for the Company. If the Chairman of our Board of Directors is not an independent director, our Board of Directors annually selects an independent director to serve as the "Lead Independent Director" responsible for coordinating the activities of the independent directors. If the Chairman of our Board of Directors is an independent director, our Board of Directors may nonetheless select a Lead Independent Director from one of the other independent directors.
Bryan B. DeBoer is our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sidney B. DeBoer is our Chairman of the Board. We believe that the separation of the CEO and Chairman positions is beneficial because it allows our CEO to focus his energy and time on operating the Company while simultaneously allowing our Chairman to exercise his leadership strengths. Because Sidney B. 
DeBoer is not an independent director, our Board of Directors appointed Thomas R. Becker as Lead Independent Director, and he has served in that capacity since 2008.
Sidney B. DeBoer, as Manager of Lithia Holding Company, L.L.C. ("Lithia Holding"), has the authority to vote all of the Class B common stock, which has 27.7% of the voting power of our outstanding voting shares. To ensure independent oversight of management and the transparency expected from a public company:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As described below under "Certain Relationships and Transactions with Related Persons," Sidney B. DeBoer has entered into a Class B Conversion Agreement under which he has agreed to cause all of the remaining shares of Class B common stock to be converted into Class A common stock by December 31, 2025; 
[END TABLE]
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  11
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We maintain a Board comprised of a majority of independent directors, and the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee are composed solely of independent directors; 
• At least once each quarter, with the Lead Independent Director presiding, the independent directors meet privately in executive session; 
• Annually, an independent third party conducts a 360 degree review of our Chief Executive Officer with the other Board members and the officers reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The results of that review are shared with the independent directors; 
• An independent third party also annually conducts a review of the performance of each director, each Board committee, and the Board as a whole;  
• Each committee chair sets the agenda for his or her committee meeting and all directors are permitted to propose items for consideration by any committee or the full Board; 
• Each committee is given the right in its charter to retain outside advisors (including legal counsel) in its discretion; and 
• We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (each of which is available on our website at www.lithia.com). 
[END TABLE]
We believe our Board and committee structure, practices and policies, as described above, allow our Board of Directors to provide adequate, independent oversight of management. Shareholders may contact the Lead Independent Director or the independent directors as a group using the procedures described in "Shareholder and Other Interested Party Communications" below.
Our Board's Risk Oversight Role
Our Board of Directors monitors the risks facing our business by evaluating our risk management processes, including the processes established to monitor how management reports material risks to our Board of Directors and how our executive team manages the various risks that our business faces. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews the potential severity of various risks faced by our Company (including geographic risks and the potential impact of new laws on the business) and the likelihood that they will occur. Our Board of Directors collaborates with management on developing the Company's annual risk management plan and as part of that process helps management ensure that those risks and uncertainties are considered in management's ongoing operations and in creating the Company's annual risk management plan.
Our Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for certain areas of its risk oversight to its standing committees.
The Compensation Committee, together with our Board of Directors, reviews and manages our compensation policies and programs to ensure they do not encourage excessive risk-taking by our executives and employees. The Compensation Committee reviews a summary and assessment of such risks at least annually and in connection with the discussion or review of individual elements of compensation.
The Audit Committee reviews our material financial risk exposures and the process by which management assesses and manages financial risks. The Audit Committee also meets with management to discuss the steps management has taken to 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  12
assess, monitor and mitigate risks that the Company faces. While our Board of Directors oversees risk management, our management is charged with managing risk through effective internal controls and processes, which facilitate the identification and management of risks, and management regularly discusses risk management with our Board of Directors.
Director Qualifications and Nominations
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating potential director nominees to fill any vacancies on our Board of Directors. The committee recommends director nominees with backgrounds and qualifications that complement each other and collectively allow our Board of Directors to fulfill its responsibilities.
The Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews the composition of our Board and evaluates the qualifications and contributions of the current directors in the context of the desired composition of our Board, our operating requirements and the interests of our shareholders. The committee also routinely reviews and interviews candidates for our Board of Directors whose background and experience suggest they may be qualified to join our Board. The qualifications required of individuals for consideration as a Board nominee vary according to the particular areas of expertise sought as a complement to our existing Board of Directors composition at the time of any vacancy. Potential candidates may be suggested by various sources, including management, Board members, shareholders, legal counsel, business leaders and other industry executives and directors. In connection with its search for a replacement nominee for Mr. Becker, who is not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting, the Nominating and Governance Committee engaged the services of Egon Zehender International, Inc. to assist with the search.  Ms. McIntyre was recommended as a nominee to serve on the Board by the Nominating and Governance Committee.
The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates the qualifications of potential director nominee candidates, including candidates proposed by shareholders, based on criteria that include the individual's skills, experience and other factors in the context of the current composition of our Board of Directors, to maintain our Board's overall diversity. Among other aspects, the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates the following factors when evaluating director nominees: business experience, other directorships, business and personal relationships with management, educational background, expertise in finance, knowledge of financial reporting and the business of the Company, and industry experience. In this context, diversity encompasses differences of viewpoint, personal and professional experience, education, skill, and other individual qualities and backgrounds, such as gender, race and ethnicity. At a minimum, qualified director nominees must have the ability to dedicate sufficient time to Board activities, and candidates for a position as an independent director must meet applicable NYSE independence standards and not have any conflicts of interest with the Company. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews its effectiveness in balancing these criteria when assessing the composition of our Board.
Beginning with this Annual Meeting, directors will no longer be considered independent if they have been on the Board for 15 or more years, and no person may serve as an Independent director after attaining the age of 79. As a result of this policy, Mr. Becker, who has served on the Board since 1996 and has been on the board for 15 or more years, is not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting.
We require all of our directors to annually sign an acknowledgment of their confidentiality obligations and obligations under our insider trading policy and other applicable policies to reinforce their commitment to protect our confidential information and our business reputation and to comply with applicable securities laws.
We seek to attract and retain qualified candidates for Board membership regardless of the origin of recommendation, and there are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder or the Committee itself. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider potential nominees recommended by any record or beneficial shareholder. See "Shareholder and Other Interested Party Communications-Shareholder Director Recommendations" below.

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
We adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive, financial and accounting officers. A complete copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.lithia.com. You may request a copy by mail from our Investor Relations Department, Lithia Motors, Inc., 150 N. Bartlett Street, Medford, Oregon 97501. We intend to publicly disclose any amendment to and any waiver of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our website.

BOARD COMPENSATION
Compensation of Directors
Non-Employee Director Compensation. Our directors serve from election at each annual meeting until the following annual meeting or until the director's successor is elected and qualified. The Compensation Committee annually reviews non-employee director compensation and recommends changes to our Board of Directors. If accepted, any recommended change is effective for the ensuing service year. Accordingly, the actual compensation paid to a non-employee director in a calendar year is generally earned under two separate compensation plans. Except for Sidney B. DeBoer, directors who are employees of the Company are not compensated separately for their service as directors. As noted in the Non-Employee Director Compensation Table, for his services as a director, Sidney B. DeBoer receives the same compensation, in the same form, as the Company pays to its non-employee directors. Separately, Sidney B. DeBoer receives payments for his prior services rendered as an employee that are described below under "Certain Relationships and Transactions with Related Persons." on pg 57.  Executive officers of the Company do not recommend or determine non-employee director compensation. Our non-employee directors are Ms. Cain and Messrs. Becker, Miramontes, Roberts and Robino.
We pay a majority of our non-employee directors' compensation as equity awards. The Compensation Committee believes that paying a majority of the annual compensation in equity provides non-employee directors with a vested interest in our long-term financial success and aligns their interests with those of our shareholders. The compensation structure for our non-employee directors for the 2018-2019 service year was:
$85,000 cash plus an additional $15,000 cash to each director who serves as a committee chair, lead independent director or as chairman of the Board. In  each case, cash amounts are paid in 12 monthly installments over the service period.
An award for a number of RSUs, which are settled in shares of our Class A common stock, with a value of $140,000. The number of RSUs awarded is based on the average closing share price for the 40 trading days prior to the award grant date.
We currently grant RSU awards to our non-employee directors immediately after the annual shareholder meeting. The RSU awards vest over one year, with 25% vesting on the first business day of the month after each regularly scheduled quarterly meeting of our Board of Directors if the director continues to serve on that day. All equity grants to non-employee directors are subject to our stock ownership policy. See "Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Policy; Hedging and Pledging Restrictions" below.
Our Board of Directors believes the compensation of our non-employee directors is equitable, and that by paying most of the non-employee directors' compensation as equity awards subject to our stock ownership policy, we tie the directors' compensation to shareholder interests. The Compensation Committee periodically engages independent consultants to review the market competitiveness of the compensation paid to the non-employee directors compared to Company peers. The Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance LLC in 2018 to help it assess non-employee director compensation for the 2018-2019 Board service year and Pay Governance LLC advised that non-employee director compensation is at the median compared to Company Peers.

Deferred Compensation Agreements with Non-Employee Directors. We offer our non-employee directors the opportunity to defer receipt of their compensation by entering into a Deferred Compensation Agreement with the Company. Under this agreement, participants, including the non-employee directors, who elect to defer compensation may defer receipt of all or a portion of their cash compensation and any stock award.  In 2018, no director elected to defer cash compensation or stock compensation.
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  16
Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Policy; Hedging and Pledging Restrictions
We expect our non-employee directors to acquire and hold sufficient shares of our common stock to meaningfully share the risks and rewards of ownership with our shareholders. Accordingly, under our Stock Ownership Policy for Directors, non-employee directors are required to acquire and retain the net after-tax shares received as compensation until the director's accumulated holdings have a market value equal to at least five times the base compensation paid to the director in the then-current service year. If a director ceases to comply with the policy, the director is expected to retain 50% of the net after-tax shares received upon the settlement of any equity incentive award until the stock ownership minimums are attained. In determining compliance with the policy, share ownership includes RSUs subject to time-vesting and indirect share ownership.
Our insider trading policy and our stock ownership policy for executive officers and directors specifies that they may not (1) engage in hedging transactions, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds or (2) hold Company securities in a margin account or otherwise pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan. In addition, securities pledged as of March 15, 2013 may continue to be pledged under existing or replacement arrangements. The number of securities that were pledged prior to such date have decreased over time. Sidney B. DeBoer is a member and the manager of Lithia Holding, which has the sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the Company's Class B common stock; all of the 800,000 shares of Class B common stock held by Lithia Holding are pledged by Lithia Holding to secure a loan to Lithia Holding. Kenneth E. Roberts has a line of credit that is secured by the securities held in one of his brokerage accounts, including 59,775 shares of Class A common stock of Lithia; no amounts were drawn on this line of credit as of February 28, 2019. Thomas R. Becker has a line of credit that is secured by the securities held in one of his brokerage accounts, including 50,095 shares of Class A common stock of Lithia; no amounts were drawn on this line of credit as of February 28, 2019.

Term    If elected, each nominee will hold office until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is elected and qualified.  
Director Replacement and Resignation Policy/Election by Majority Vote    We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, if any nominee should become unable or unwilling to serve, proxies may be voted for another person nominated by our Board of Directors.   Because our Board of Directors is elected by a plurality of votes, it is possible directors can be elected with less than a majority vote in favor of their election. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Director Resignation Policy to address the possibility that, in an uncontested election of directors, a director could be elected with more "withheld" votes than votes cast "for" the director. A director receiving more "withheld" votes than "for" votes must tender his or her resignation from our Board of Directors within five business days after certification of the election results. Within ninety days after receipt of such resignation, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the resignation offer and make a recommendation to our Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the offer to resign. Our Board of Directors will disclose its decision on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC. The Nominating and Governance Committee will not nominate for election any person who in the previous year's election received more "withheld" votes than votes cast "for" the person. The full Director Resignation Policy is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines which may be accessed on our website at www.lithia.com.   Proposal 4 in this proxy statement would amend the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to require majority voting in uncontested elections of directors. See "Proposal 4: Approval of Amendments to the Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to Adopt Majority Voting for Uncontested Elections of Directors" for more information.

PROPOSAL NO. 2
Advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K
We are asking shareholders to approve the following advisory resolution on the executive compensation reported in this proxy statement:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and related tables, notes and narrative discussion in the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, is approved.
The advisory vote, which is required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, is a vote to approve or disapprove the overall compensation package of our executive officers and not any one specific element of the compensation package or on the compensation received by any one person. The advisory vote is non-binding and does not overrule a decision by the Company, our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty for our officers or directors. However, the Compensation Committee and Board will review and consider the results of the advisory vote when making future decisions about executive compensation. Because we typically determine annual compensation before the advisory vote on the prior year's compensation is cast, however, if we determine to make a change in our practices based on shareholder feedback, there may be a delay in implementing those changes.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, over 98% of the advisory votes cast on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and related tables, notes and narrative discussion in the Proxy Statement for our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, were cast "for" that compensation. The Compensation Committee considered this shareholder approval when it determined 2019 compensation. Based on the approval and on our belief that our compensation philosophy, programs and practices in 2017 were effective in promoting our strong financial performance, we did not make material changes to the philosophy, programs or practices in 2018. The increases we made to the amount of compensation that we paid to our executives between 2017 and 2018 reflect our improved financial performance and increased responsibility and experience of our executives.
We urge shareholders to read the detailed information about our compensation philosophy and objectives included in Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), below, which provides context for the Summary Compensation Table and related information. As discussed in the CD&A, we believe our compensation programs align the interests of our executives and our shareholders, help us attract and retain experienced executive talent, and focus our executives on performance and achievement of our short-, mid- and long-term strategic goals and objectives. We believe the overall compensation paid in 2018 was appropriate, particularly considering our financial results in 2018.
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers.

Compensation Committee Responsibilities
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing the compensation philosophy and policies that govern the Company's executive compensation programs. Most importantly, the Compensation Committee is responsible for:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• adopting and guiding processes for the performance and compensation management of the CEO; 
• recommending and guiding processes for the performance and compensation management of the executives in positions that could conceivably succeed the CEO, all for the recommendation and approval of the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
and
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing oversight to any other human resources actions impacting the CEO or the executives in positions that could conceivably succeed the CEO. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has oversight of the Company's strategic goals and objectives relevant to compensation, the compensation components, performance evaluations, succession planning and related matters of all executive management. The Committee oversees the administration of the Company's stock incentive plans, stock purchase plans, other equity incentive plans, profit sharing plans, and pension plans. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing, discussing and approving the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in the annual proxy statement the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Compensation Program Risk Assessment
Our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee are required to assess whether our compensation policies and practices and, in particular, our performance‐based compensation practices, encourage executives or other employees to take unnecessary or unreasonable risks that could threaten the long‐term value of the Company or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Management believes that our practices adequately manage this risk because:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our executive compensation plan is benchmarked to an independent compensation survey; 
• we limit the amount of fixed compensation in the form of base salary based on data from our market survey; 
• the primary criteria we use for performance compensation components are "bottom line" measures such as pre‐tax profit and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are less susceptible to manipulation for short‐term gain than are "top line" measures; 
• cash bonuses are capped; 
• the incentive plans for executive management have the flexibility to put weight on Company‐wide or divisional performance measures; 
• our cash bonus plan preserves discretion to permit the Committee to elect not to pay otherwise achieved bonus amounts for any reason; 
• a meaningful component of compensation is equity grants with extended vesting periods designed to ensure that our executives value and focus on the Company's long‐term performance; 
• NEOs have equity positions in Lithia and are subject to stock ownership policies, which we believe increases their focus on long‐term shareholder value; 
[END TABLE]
and
[BEGIN TABLE]
• executive compensation is subject to our "claw‐back" policy.

Compensation Performance
The Company feels strongly that it should align performance compensation with objectives that the management team can control. These include objectives such as: pre‐tax profit, earnings per share, and OEM approvability.
The Company periodically assesses how CEO compensation relates to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over historical pay periods. However, because TSR reflects many things management cannot control or influence, including interest rates, unemployment, industry sales, fuel prices and political issues, the Company does not believe it is an appropriate target measure for forward‐looking compensation objectives.
CEO 2017 Pay Alignment
The following chart shows Lithia's CEO's 2017 actual total direct compensation (TDC) and one‐year TSR ranking for 2017 in relation to members of Lithia's peer group. 2017 actual total direct compensation is the most recent pay information available for the peer group. The 2017 actual TDC is comprised of base salary, actual bonus, and grant date value of equity awards.  TSR reflects 1-year TSR from 12/31/16 to 12/31/17.  LAD pay is aligned with performance, as TSR is at the 90th percentile, and actual TDC is at the 42nd percentile.
The following chart shows the Company's 3-year TSR in relation to the peer group through December 31, 2018.

Compensation Plan Features
Compensation Governance Provisions
To align management and shareholder interests, and to mitigate any potential incentive for management to take inappropriate risks, the Company has the following policies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership Policy: NEOs and Non‐NEO Vice Presidents are expected to acquire and hold shares of our Class A common stock with a market value equal to a multiple of their base salary, as indicated in the table below, within (7) seven years of service in their position. Our stock ownership policy more closely aligns the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our shareholders and exposes our NEOs to downside equity performance risk.  A Stock Ownership Compliance review is performed quarterly, and a policy reminder is sent to employees on an annual basis. 
Position Multiple of Salary 
Chief Executive President 5 
Executive Vice President 3 
Senior Vice President 2

• Insider Trading Policy: The policy sent to all employees defines insider trading and certain employees determined to have potential access to insider trader information are blocked from selling during predetermined closed selling periods. In addition, Section 16 employees and Directors are required to notify the Company of any trades. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Claw-backs: Compensation that we pay based on performance, including annual performance bonuses and equity compensation, is subject to a "claw-back" policy.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Bryan DeBoer, our Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"):
We identified the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees using the annualized base salary and expected bonus, as of December 31, 2018, plus any equity awards and long-term incentives granted in 2018 for all individuals, excluding the CEO, who were employed by us during 2018 (total compensation was annualized for employees not employed for the full year).  After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO compensation.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the employee identified at median of our company (other than the CEO), was $40,944; 
• and the annual total compensation of the CEO was $7,615,943 (this amount assumes maximum bonus and equity potential vs. the CEO pay disclosed in the Summary Compensation table, which is the actual amount earned); 
• for this ratio, both employee compensation (other than our CEO) and CEO compensation were calculated using 2018 paid wages, annualized for full-time and part-time employees who did not work a full year. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Bryan DeBoer, our Chief Executive Officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was estimated to be 186 to 1.

Peer Groups and Pay Targeting
Peer Selection Methodology, Rationale and Comparison
Lithia benchmarks overall annual compensation for executives at the median of the most current peer group because we believe this group best represents our competition for executive talent. The peer group is reviewed each year by our Independent Compensation Consultants using a defined methodology that identifies companies reasonably similar to Lithia in terms of industry, industry profile, size, and market capitalization to revenue ratio and profit margins. Below is a list of peer groups:

Pay Targeting Level
It is important to note that in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee does not solely rely on comparative data from the 2018 Peer Group. Such comparative data provides helpful market information about our peer companies, but the Compensation Committee does not target any specific positioning or percentile, nor does it use a formulaic approach, in determining executive pay levels. The Compensation Committee also utilizes other resources, including reputable compensation surveys and other available proxy and compensation data. All such comparative peer data and supplemental resources are considered, along with the Company's pay for performance and internal parity objectives. All applicable information is reviewed and considered in aggregate, and the Compensation Committee does not place any particular weighting on any one factor.

Pay
Pay Mix, Performance Metric, and Goal Setting
After we establish target TDC levels for each executive officer, we allocate TDC between the following components, depending on the individual:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Salary A competitive market salary that sufficiently covers a fixed income component the employee can rely on. The fixed salary is set at a level that provides the ability to attract talent and promotes long-term retention.  
Base Salary A competitive market salary that sufficiently covers a fixed income component the employee can rely on. The fixed salary is set at a level that provides the ability to attract talent and promotes long-term retention.  
Performance Bonus The bonus compensation plan is tied to quantitative performance objectives set at least annually by management and the Board of Directors. Bonus compensation is intended to reward employee contribution for attaining short‐term Company level objectives and to promote continued focus on high performance while balancing the Company's long‐term strategic plan. Bonus objectives are set to support growth in the Company's profitability, maximize our capital deployment strategies, and increase share value. The Company will use short and mid‐term earnings forecasts, analyst estimates, and strategic planning needs to set the profit objectives each period. We believe using metrics that promote high performance and profitable growth is critical. The Compensation Committee has positive and negative discretion to modify performance‐based awards.  Management provides the Compensation Committee a quarterly review of the Bonus and Equity Attainment Pacing.  The Compensation Committee also may award discretionary bonuses when an executive's or employee's performance merits it.   
Equity Awards A compensation tool that leverages Lithia's public company status to offer  Equity Award compensation that rewards employees for achieving Company quantitative financial performance objectives set annually by management and the Board of Directors. We believe using metrics that promote high performance and profitable growth is critical. Equity Award compensation ensures retention of key executives by using  longer-term vesting periods and helps maximize our return to shareholders.  We believe issuing restricted stock units rather than stock options better aligns our executive team with our shareholders because restricted stock units experience the upside as well as the downside of stock price changes.  Because Lithia's stock price has been somewhat volatile, the value of stock options can significantly fluctuate. We believe this unnecessarily distracts employees and reduces their incentive to continuously improve the operations of the business whenever market prices dip below the options exercise price.  In addition, issuing stock options can subject the company to an accounting expense even if the options are valueless to the grantee.   Therefore, using restricted stock units seem to better instill a sense of ownership and employee perceived value. 
Other Perquisites and Benefits  Additional other compensation benefits that are industry‐standard or enhance the competitiveness of compensation for key employees include a vehicle allowance, long term care assistance, long-term disability insurance, and life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance.

Pay Mix Rationale
The Company believes that as an employee moves into higher level positions in the Company, base pay should become a smaller component of overall TDC. Using competitive information as a guide, and after considering current position performance, succession planning and retention needs, the Company allocated pay components for its CEO in 2018 as follows. Approximately 82% of our CEO target TDC mix is performance-based, similar to the peer group.
2018 Peer Group Mix
Tax Implications
The Company considers the effects of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which generally disallows the tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million for certain covered individuals.  As part of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the revisions to Section 162(m), a transitional provision allows for deductions of certain qualifying performance-based compensation with respect to payments made pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on November 2, 2017. Thus, certain performance-based awards that are payable in the Company's current year that were pursuant to a binding written agreement prior to November 2, 2017 may be subject to the previous Section 162(m) law if applicable requirements are met.
The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards may result in non-deductible compensation expenses. Therefore the Committee has approved salaries and other awards for executive officers that were not fully deductible because of Section 162(m) and, in light of the repeal of the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m), expects in the future to approve additional compensation that is not deductible for income tax purposes.

Base Salary The Compensation Committee established the 2018 base salary for our CEO based on competitive market factors, the CEO's duties and responsibilities, comparison of relative CEO pay within the auto retail and industry peer groups mentioned above, our performance and the relative pay of our senior management team. The base salaries of all other NEOs are approved by the Compensation Committee and are based on both financial and non-financial criteria, the executives' respective responsibilities, the relative internal pay equity among the senior executives and current market conditions, including relative pay within the industry.

Performance Bonus In 2018, our performance bonus plan compensated executives for achieving annual performance goals. Each NEO had a maximum cash bonus potential based on a percentage of base salary ranging from 160% to 300%. The Compensation Committee set this range based on its view that the pay we offer to our NEOs for exceptional performance should be at least equal to, and for some NEOs it should be greater than, the NEO's base salary. We calculated bonus payments by multiplying the executive's maximum bonus level by the executive's salary and the performance criteria achievement level. For example, if an executive's maximum bonus level were 150% and the performance goals attained were 50% of potential, the executive's bonus would equal 75% of the executive's base salary (i.e., base salary multiplied by 150% then multiplied by 50%).

 Equity Awards
In 2018, we awarded an aggregate of 49,931 performance and time-vesting RSUs to NEOs. The performance and time-vesting RSUs vest 33% on January 1st of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th anniversary of the award year, so that awards are fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the award date. The performance-vesting RSUs vest when the compensation committee certifies that the performance condition has been attained. The Compensation Committee determined the number of RSUs awarded to NEOs and other key employees after considering peer comparisons, the percentage of total compensation and targets based on adjusted earnings per share for 2018.
Each 2018 performance and time-vesting RSU awarded to our NEOs was contingent on us meeting specified adjusted earnings per share thresholds for 2018, adjusted as described above. The thresholds were determined based on a percentage of the high end of external guidance from analysts who cover Lithia's stock as follows.
[BEGIN TABLE]
EPS Threshold% of RSUs Earned 
$10.50 (highest) 150.0% 
$8.95 - $9.25 100.0 
$6.80 50.0 
$0.01 - $6.79 41.7 
$0.00 or negative 0.0

For 2018, our bonus attainment EPS was $9.10, which resulted in 100% of the 2018 performance and time-vesting RSUs becoming earned. See above and in Year in Review for reconciliation of this measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.
In 2016, the Compensation Committee awarded certain key employees, including each NEO, performance-based RSUs that vest when the Company first attains annual adjusted earnings per share of $9.00. These awards range from 50% to 100% of 2015 base compensation (Bryan B. DeBoer - 100%; Christopher S. Holzshu - 80%; Scott A. Hillier - 50%; George C. Liang - 50%; John F. North III - 50%). RSUs awarded at the $9.00 target are forfeited if not earned within three years of the date of the award.
Other Perquisites and Benefits
We provide our NEOs with an vehicle allowance, insurance premiums for long term care assistance , long-term disability, life and accidental death and dismemberment on their behalf. Our NEOs are generally eligible to participate in benefit programs available to all full-time employees, including health and disability insurance, and our 401(k) plan. However, because of limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code applicable to principal shareholders and their family members, Bryan B. DeBoer is not eligible to participate in our 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for 2018 reflect awards under the Cash Bonus Performance Plan. The Cash Performance Bonus Plan is structured such that the total amount earned each period is tied directly to our performance for the period. To see the performance criteria used in 2018 and for additional discussion about the Performance Bonus Plan, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - 2018 Executive Compensation by Element- Performance Bonus" above. The performance bonus potential for each NEO is a percentage of base salary ranging from 160% to 300% (depending on position) with the maximum amount being earned if all criteria elements are satisfied at the highest level. 
The Equity Incentive Plan Awards in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for 2018 were awarded under our Stock Incentive Plan and are subject to forfeiture depending on whether we achieve specified performance criteria. (See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - 2018 Executive Compensation by Element - Equity Based Compensation" for the performance criteria used in 2018).

Our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plan permits us to contribute awards for participants that will have a deferred payout. Under this plan, senior executives may defer receipt of portions of their compensation (up to 50% of base salary, and 100% of variable compensation) in any given year, with all amounts deferred earning interest at an annual rate set by the Compensation Committee. (See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - 2018 Executive Compensation by Element - Retirement Plan").

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment
In certain circumstances, such as in connection with succession planning or the death or disability of our senior executive officers, it is appropriate to provide severance payments, accelerated vesting of RSUs and certain other limited payments to those executives.
Benefits payable to NEOs upon death, disability or retirement
For all RSUs granted to NEOs in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (other than the long-term performance RSUs), if the NEO becomes disabled while employed by us, the RSUs continue to vest as scheduled for so long as the NEO remains disabled. If the NEO dies (or, with respect to the RSUs granted to NEOs in 2015 or 2016, if the NEO dies on or after January 1, 2016 or January 1, 2017, respectively), or if the NEO retires after age 65 and having been employed by the Company for at least four years, a pro rata portion of the RSUs (other than any unearned long-term performance RSUs) becomes vested. The prorated portion of the RSUs that becomes vested on death or retirement is the total number of RSUs earned by the NEO based on the performance measures but not yet vested under the service requirement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months elapsed from the date of grant through the date of the NEO recipient's death or retirement, and the denominator of which is 48. Under our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plan, discretionary benefits contributed by us to a participant's account fully vest upon the participant's death or disability.
The following table sets forth the estimated benefits that would have been payable to our NEOs under the RSUs and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plan if each NEOs employment had been terminated on December 31, 2018 because of death or disability:

Potential Payments Upon Change in Control
If we are facing a potential change in control transaction and the proposed transaction would likely negatively affect one or more of our senior executives, we believe it is risky to assume that those senior executives will work against their financial interest, even if the proposed transaction would be in the best interest of our shareholders. We believe that, in such case, our executives should not be motivated by financial self-interest but rather should be appropriately compensated if the completion of the transaction results in a loss of their job. Accordingly, we believe that providing "double-trigger" severance payments, accelerating the vesting of RSUs and certain other limited payments are an appropriate means of achieving alignment between the interests of our senior executives and our shareholders in the context of a potential transaction that would result in a change in control.

Change in Control Agreements
We are party to double-trigger Change in Control Agreements with Bryan B. DeBoer, Christopher S. Holzshu, Scott A. Hillier, George C. Liang and John F. North III. Under those agreements, if, after a change in control, the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, each as defined below, we will pay the executive:

Continuing Change in Control Benefits• Continuing long-term care insurance premiums for 24 months after the separation date; and• • Continuing health insurance benefits until the earlier of (a) 18 months after the separation date, (b) the full COBRA period required by law or (c) when the executive becomes eligible for employer-sponsored health insurance from a subsequent employer.  [END TABLE]
  The Change in Control Agreements also contain non-solicitation, non-competition and non-disparagement provisions, but (i) those provisions are dependent on the executive electing to receive the change in control benefits identified above and (ii) the  Company's remedy if the executive violates the non-competition provisions is limited to causing the executive to forfeit profit sharing or other bonus compensation that has not yet been paid to the executive, excluding any equity awards awarded before January 1, 2016. If applicable, the non-solicitation and non-competition provisions are effective for two years following the date of the executive's separation from service with us. If applicable, the non-disparagement provision is effective for three years from that date. The Change in Control Agreements also contain provisions regarding non-disclosure (for three years from the date of the executive's separation from service) and assignment of interest in all creative works that are not dependent on the executive receiving any change in control benefits under the agreement.
Under the Change in Control Agreements:
A "Change in Control" occurs if: (A) the Company merges or consolidates with another entity and, as a result, less than 50% of the combined voting power of the resulting entity immediately after the merger or consolidation is held by persons who were the holders of the Company's voting securities immediately before the merger or consolidation; (B) any person, entity, or group of persons or entities, other than through merger or consolidation, acquires 50% or more of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Company's outstanding stock (excluding such a change through the transfer of the Company's outstanding stock or interests in Lithia Holding to the Sidney B. DeBoer Trust or the election of Bryan DeBoer or the Sidney B. DeBoer Family Trust as the manager of Lithia Holding) or acquires substantially all of the Company's assets; (C) any one

person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 50% or more of the total
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting power of the stock of the Company (excluding such a change through the transfer of the Company's outstanding stock or interests in Lithia Holding to the Sidney B. DeBoer Trust or the election of the Sidney B. DeBoer Family Trust as the manager of Lithia Holding); or (D) a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are removed from office by a vote of the Company's shareholders over the recommendation of our Board or replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors before the date of the appointment or election; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Cause" for termination of employment means any one or more of the following: (A) willful misfeasance, gross negligence or conduct involving dishonesty in the performance of the executive's duties, as determined by our Board of Directors; (B) conviction of a crime in connection with the executive's duties or any felony; (C) conduct significantly harmful to the Company, as reasonably determined by our Board of Directors, including but not limited to intentional violation of law or of any significant policy or procedure of the Company; (D) refusal or failure to act in accordance with a stipulation, requirement or directive of our Board of Directors (provided such directive is lawful); or (E) failure to faithfully or diligently perform any of the duties of the executive's employment which are specified in the Change in Control Agreement, articulated by our Board of Directors, or are usual and customary duties of the executive's employment if the executive has not corrected the problem or formulated a plan for its correction with our Board (if such failure is not susceptible to immediate correction) within 30 days after notice to the executive; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Good Reason" for an executive's resignation means (A) any one or more of the following occurs without the executive's consent: (1) a material diminution of the executive's base compensation (unless consistent with an across-the-board pay reduction for all senior management and not in excess of 20%); (2) a material change in the geographic location at which the executive must perform services for the Company; (3) a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties or responsibilities, or (4) any action or inaction by the Company that constitutes a material breach of the Change in Control Agreement; (B) the executive provides notice to the Company of the existence of the condition within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition; (C) the Company has 30 days following receipt of such notice to remedy the condition and fails to do so; and (D) the executive resigns within twelve months of such event occurring. For purposes of clause (A)(3) of the previous sentence, whether a material diminution in the executive's authority has occurred shall be determined in part by comparing the authority and positions of the persons to whom the executive directly reports immediately prior to the Change in Control or the announcement of the Change in Control with the authority and positions of the persons to whom the executive directly reports immediately after the claimed diminution in the executive's authority. For example, if the executive was the CEO of the Company before the Company was acquired by a competing business, a material diminution in the CEO's authority would include, but not be limited to, the CEO not serving as the CEO of the consolidated competing business after its acquisition of the Company. 
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding the provision for change in control benefits in the Change in Control Agreements, each Change in Control Agreement contains a provision stating that if any benefit payable by us to the executive, including, without limitation, the change in control benefits specified in the agreement, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, those benefits shall be reduced to the largest amount that will result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. While the executive may select which particular benefits will be reduced to comply with this provision, the determination of the amount of reduction in the benefits required is made by mutual agreement of us and the executive and, if no agreement is possible, by our independent registered public accountants.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plan
Under our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plan, discretionary benefits contributed to a participant's account by us fully vest upon a change in control, as defined under Code Section 409A or Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, even if the NEO's employment is not terminated. Vested discretionary benefits are paid to a participant in an annual installment method over ten years.

PROPOSAL NO. 3
Approval of Amendment to the Company's Bylaws to 
Provide Shareholders with a "Proxy Access" Right
We are asking our shareholders to approve so-called "proxy access" amendments to our Bylaws. Proxy access allows eligible shareholders to include their director nominees in our proxy materials for our annual meetings of shareholders, along with director nominees nominated by our Board of Directors.
Background
In connection with its annual review of the Company's corporate governance practices, our Board of Directors, with the advice and support of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has decided to implement proxy access through an amendment to our Bylaws as set forth in our proposed Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are attached to this proxy statement as Appendix 1  (the "Proxy Access Amendments"). The Proxy Access Amendments will become effective only if they are approved by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.
Our Board of Directors believes that implementation of proxy access in the manner set forth in the Proxy Access Amendments will provide meaningful rights to our shareholders while ensuring that the rights are used in a responsible manner, and believes that the Proxy Access Amendments are in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the Proxy Access Amendments.
If the Proxy Access Amendments are approved by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting, the Proxy Access Amendments will become effective upon such approval. If the Proxy Access Amendments are approved by our shareholders, proxy access will be available for use beginning with our 2020 Annual Meeting.
Description of the Proxy Access Amendments
The following description is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Proxy Access Amendments as set forth in our proposed Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix 1. We urge you to read Appendix 1 in its entirety before casting your vote.
Shareholder Eligibility to Nominate Proxy Access Nominees
Subject to certain conditions and procedures as set forth in more detail in the Proxy Access Amendments, a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors continuously for at least three years would be permitted to include a specified number of director nominees and a supporting statement (up to 500 words in support of each nominee's election) in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of shareholders. Two or more funds that are: (i) under common management and investment control; (ii) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer; or (iii) a group of investment companies (as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940) will be counted as one shareholder for purposes of the 20-shareholder group limit. No person may be a member of more than one group of shareholders constituting an eligible shareholder with respect to any annual meeting of shareholders.
Calculation of Qualifying Ownership
To ensure that the interests of shareholders seeking to include proxy access nominees in our proxy materials are aligned with those of our other shareholders, a shareholder would be deemed to own only those shares of our common stock as to which the shareholder possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to such shares and (ii) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The following shares would not count as "owned" shares for purposes of determining whether the ownership threshold has been met:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares sold by the shareholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed; 
• shares borrowed by the shareholder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by the shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell;  
[END TABLE]
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  40
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares that were entered into short positions or otherwise sold short; or 
• shares subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative, or similar agreement entered into by the shareholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of our outstanding shares, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder's or any of its affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or any of its affiliates. 
[END TABLE]
A shareholder will be deemed to "own" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder retains the right to instruct how such shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in such shares. A shareholder's ownership of shares will also be deemed to continue during any period in which the shareholder has (i) delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the shareholder or (ii) loaned such shares, provided that the shareholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on not more than five business days' notice and has recalled such loan shares promptly after being notified that any of its nominees will be included in the Company's proxy statement, and the shareholder holds the recalled shares through the annual meeting.
Maximum Permitted Number of Proxy Access Nominees
The maximum number of proxy access nominees submitted by all eligible shareholders that the Company would be required to include in our proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders shall not exceed 20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a notice of proxy access nomination may be delivered to the Company. This maximum permitted number of proxy access nominees will be reduced as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the nomination deadline and before the date of the annual meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the maximum permitted number of proxy access nominees shall be calculated based on the reduced size of the Board of Directors; and 
• any director in office as of the nomination deadline who was included in the Company's proxy statement as a shareholder nominee for any of the three preceding annual meetings and whom the Board of Directors decides to nominate for election to the Board of Directors will be counted against the maximum permitted number of proxy access nominees.   
[END TABLE]
Further, the Company would not be required to include any proxy access nominees in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of shareholders for which the Company receives notice that a shareholder intends to nominate one or more persons for election to the Board pursuant to the Company's advance notice provisions set forth in Section 1.3 of our Bylaws.
Procedure for Selecting Proxy Access Nominees if Maximum Permitted Number is Exceeded
Any shareholder submitting more than one nominee for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement shall rank such nominees based on the order in which the shareholder desires such nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement in the event that the total number of nominees submitted by shareholders pursuant to the proxy access procedure exceeds the maximum permitted number. In the event that the number of nominees submitted by shareholders pursuant to the proxy access procedure exceeds the maximum permitted number, the highest ranking nominee who meets the applicable eligibility requirements from each nominating shareholder will be selected for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement until the maximum permitted number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Company's capital stock each nominating shareholder disclosed as owned in its nomination notice. If the maximum permitted number is not reached after the highest ranking nominee who meets the applicable requirements from each nominating shareholder has been selected, then the next highest ranking nominee who meets the applicable requirements from each nominating shareholder will be selected for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement, and this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum permitted number is reached.  
Deadline for Submitting Proxy Access Nominees
In order to provide adequate time for the Board to assess proxy access nominees, requests to include such nominees in our proxy materials must be received no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days before the first anniversary of the mailing date of our definitive proxy statement for the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders, subject to certain adjustments. If the Proxy Access Amendments are approved by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting, eligible shareholders may submit proxy access nominees for 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  41
inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders no earlier than October 13, 2019 and no later than November 12, 2019.

2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  45
PROPOSAL NO. 4
Approval of Amendments to the Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to Adopt Majority Voting for Uncontested Elections of Directors
Oregon law requires that elections of directors of Oregon corporations be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote unless a corporation's articles of incorporation impose some other standard. Under this plurality voting standard, director nominees receiving the highest number of "FOR" votes will be elected, regardless of the number of votes withheld. At the Annual Meeting, the existing plurality voting standard will continue to apply. 
Shareholders are being asked at this Annual Meeting to approve and adopt an amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation to replace the plurality voting standard with a majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors. If approved, this proposal would amend Article IV, Section 1 of our Restated Articles of Incorporation to establish majority voting for uncontested elections of directors beginning with the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. As a result, all director nominees in uncontested elections would be required to receive a number of "FOR" votes representing at least a majority of votes cast in the election. If such a director nominee fails to receive "FOR" votes representing at least a majority of votes cast and is an incumbent director, the Restated Articles of Incorporation would provide that the director continue to serve until the earliest of (i) 180 days following certification of the election results, (ii) the date upon which the Board of Directors appoints a replacement director, and (iii) the date of the incumbent director's resignation. Following the election the Nominating and Governance Committee would then be charged with making a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the vacancy, and the Board of Directors would act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation within 180 days of the certification of the election results. 
In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the plurality voting standard would continue to apply. The majority voting standard would not apply to vacancies on the Board (including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors) filled by a vote of the Board of Directors. This summary of the proposed amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendment attached as Appendix 2 to this proxy statement.
In connection with the foregoing, conforming changes would also be required to be made to our Bylaws, as set forth in Appendix 3 to this proxy statement. 
Our Board has approved the amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to adopt majority voting in uncontested director elections, subject to and conditioned upon shareholder approval at this Annual Meeting. 
On the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors is submitting this proposal to our shareholders as part of its ongoing evaluation of the Company's corporate governance practices. After careful consideration of the issue, our Board of Directors has determined to recommend a vote FOR the approval of this proposal. In determining whether to recommend adopting a majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors to our shareholders, our Board of Directors analyzed current corporate governance trends and considered the arguments in favor of and against maintaining the existing plurality voting standard. Our Board of Directors recognizes that many of our peer public companies have amended their governing documents to provide for a majority voting standard rather than a plurality standard. Our Board of Directors believes that generally requiring directors to be elected by a majority of votes cast both ensures that only director nominees with broad acceptability among our voting shareholders will be elected and enhances the accountability of each elected director to our shareholders. Accordingly, after careful consideration, our Board of Directors has determined that it would be in the best interests of our shareholders to amend our Restated Articles of Incorporation to adopt a majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors.
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of voting power of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, voting together as a single class, is required to approve this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be the equivalent of votes "against" this proposal.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR approval of the amendments to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to adopt majority voting for uncontested elections of directors.
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  46
PROPOSAL NO. 5
Approval of the Adoption of the Lithia Motors, Inc. 
2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We are asking shareholders to approve the Lithia Motors, Inc. 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or "the ESPP," as amended and restated.
The Board originally adopted the ESPP on December 14, 1997, and the shareholders originally approved the ESPP on May 14, 1998. The Board amended and restated the ESPP on March 16, 2009, and the shareholders approved the amended and restated ESPP on April 30, 2009. On February 22¸ 2019, the Board further amended and restated the ESPP (the "Revised ESPP"), subject to shareholder approval pursuant to the ESPP and applicable stock exchange requirements. The changes approved by the Board on February 22, 2019 are hereinafter referred to as the "Amendment." If the Revised ESPP is approved by the shareholders, the Revised ESPP will be effective.
The principal features and purpose of the Revised ESPP are summarized below. The following summary of the Revised ESPP does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the Revised ESPP and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Revised ESPP, which is attached as Appendix 4 to this proxy statement. Capitalized terms used but not defined in the summary have the meaning specified in the Revised ESPP.
Immediately prior to February 22, 2019, the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP was 1,500,000 shares, of which 138,643 remained available for issuance.
Summary of Amendment
The Amendment would (1) increase the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP and (2) extend the term of the ESPP for an additional ten years. In addition, the Amendment makes additional changes that are clean-up in nature.
Increase in Shares Available for Issuance. The Amendment would increase the maximum number of shares available for purchases of Class A common stock from the current 1,500,000 shares to3,000,000 shares, which is an increase of 1,500,000 shares. This increase is 6.7% of our outstanding Class A common stock as of February 28, 2019 and the maximum number of shares remaining available for issuance under the ESPP is 7.3% of our outstanding common stock as of February 28, 2019. These percentages reflect the simple dilution of our stockholders that would occur if the proposed Amendment to the ESPP is approved.
Based on the closing price on NYSE of our common stock on February 28, 2019, of $90.27 per share, the aggregate market value as of that date of the additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock requested under the Amendment was $135,405,000.
Extension of Term. The Amendment would also extend the term of the ESPP for an additional ten years, until December 31, 2029.
Summary of the Revised ESPP
Purpose. The Revised ESPP allows the Company's employees (including employees who are officers or employees of designated Company subsidiaries) to use payroll deductions to purchase Class A common stock on the terms described below.
Plan Administration. The Revised ESPP shall be administered by the compensation committee, whose administration, interpretation and application of the Revised ESPP and its terms will be final, conclusive and binding on all participants.
Securities Subject to Plan. Subject to adjustment (under the Revised ESPP), up to 1,638,643 shares of Class A common stock will be reserved for issuance pursuant to purchases made under the Revised ESPP.
Eligibility and Participation. Any Company employee employed by the Company (or by any subsidiary designated for participation) for at least 90 continuous days that is regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week and has reached the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction of his or her legal residency is eligible to participate in the Revised ESPP. Officers and members of the Board who are eligible employees are also permitted to participate in the Revised ESPP. As of February 28, 2019, approximately 14,400 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  47
employees were eligible to participate in the Revised ESPP, including 5 officers of the Company. The Revised ESPP currently has approximately 2,200 participants.
An employee will not be granted an option under the Revised ESPP if, immediately after the grant, the employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to the employee under section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding purchase rights to purchase stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any subsidiary.
Eligible employees become participants in the Revised ESPP by delivering to the Company ten days prior to the applicable Entry Date (including interim purchase dates) an authorization of payroll deductions. At the end of each fiscal quarter, each participant in the fiscal quarter will be automatically enrolled in the next succeeding fiscal quarter at the same withholding percentage unless the participant notifies the designated benefits representative in writing that the participant does not want to be re-enrolled.
Payroll Deductions. The purchase price of the shares is accumulated by payroll deductions during the fiscal quarter. Each employee participating in the Revised ESPP may elect to have up to 10% of Total Pay (defined in the Revised ESPP to include all regular straight-time earnings or base salary, plus payments for overtime, shift differentials, incentive compensation, bonuses, and other special payments, fees, allowances or extraordinary compensation) deducted and credited to that employee's account under the Revised ESPP. No additional payments or amounts may be credited to an employee's account; however, an employee may change the rate of payroll deductions (effective no sooner than the first day of the first payroll period in the next fiscal quarter) or withdraw entirely from the Revised ESPP (effective as of the first day of the payroll period as soon as administratively practicable following receipt of written notice) during any fiscal quarter.
Purchase of Stock; Exercise of Purchase Right. By electing to participate in the Revised ESPP, each employee is in effect granted a right to purchase shares of Class A common stock using payroll deductions accumulated as of last day of each applicable fiscal quarter. However, no participant may accrue rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company and its subsidiaries at a rate that exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the date of grant of those purchase rights) for each calendar year in which the purchase rights would be outstanding at any time. Unless an employee withdraws from participation in the Revised ESPP (see "Withdrawal." below), or his or her participation is otherwise discontinued (see "Termination of Employment." below), the employee's right to purchase shares will be exercised automatically at the end of each fiscal quarter at the applicable price.
Purchase Price of Company Common Stock. On the final day of each fiscal quarter, the purchase price per share will be 85% of closing sales price of the Class A common stock on the immediately preceding business day as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. On February 28, 2019, the closing market price of Class A common stock was $90.27. The participant shall not have an interest or voting right in any shares covered under the Revised ESPP prior to purchase.
Ability of the Board to Amend the Revised ESPP. The Board may terminate or amend the Revised ESPP at any time. However, shareholder approval is required for any amendment to (i) increase the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the Revised ESPP, (ii) materially amend the requirements as to the class of employees eligible to participate under the Revised ESPP, or (iii) permit members of the compensation committee to purchase shares of Class A common stock under the Revised ESPP.
Term and Termination of the Revised ESPP. If approved by shareholders, the Revised ESPP will have been deemed effective upon the adoption by the Board, and will continue in effect until December 31, 2029. However, the Board may earlier terminate the Revised ESPP at any time. If the Board terminates the Revised ESPP before an employee's right to purchase shares has been exercised under the Revised ESPP, such termination shall not adversely affect the rights of such employee without his or her written consent.
Withdrawal. An employee may terminate his or her interest in a given fiscal quarter by signing and delivering to the designated benefits representative a notice of withdrawal from the Revised ESPP. Such withdrawal may be effected at any time prior to the fifteenth day prior to the last day of the fiscal quarter. The Revised ESPP does not permit a partial withdrawal. An employee's withdrawal from the Revised ESPP during a fiscal quarter does not affect the employee's eligibility to participate in the Revised ESPP in ensuing fiscal quarters.
Termination of Employment. Termination of a participant's continuous status as an employee for any reason, including retirement, disability or death, cancels his or her participation in the Revised ESPP immediately. 
In the event of termination due to retirement, disability or death, the employee (or the employee's personal representative, legal guardian, beneficiary, administrator or executor, as applicable) will have the right to elect either to (i) withdraw all of the cash and 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  48
shares credited to the employee's account as of his or her termination date; or (ii) exercise the employee's option for the purchase of shares on the last day of the fiscal quarter in which termination occurs for the purchase of the number of shares which the cash balance credited to the employee's account as of the date of termination will purchase at the applicable price. 
In the event of termination for any other reason, any accumulated cash and shares will be delivered to the employee as soon as administratively practicable.
Nonassignability. No rights or accumulated payroll deductions of an employee under the Revised ESPP may be pledged, assigned or transferred for any reason, and any such attempt will be void and without effect.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Information
The Revised ESPP, and the right of participants to make purchases thereunder, is intended to qualify under the provisions of sections 421 and 423 of the Code. Under these provisions, no income will be taxable to a participant at the time of grant of the right to purchase, or the actual purchase of, shares. However, upon the employee's disposition of shares purchased under the Revised ESPP, the participant will generally be subject to tax. Upon disposition (including by gift), if the shares have been held by the participant for more than two years after the date of grant of the relevant option and more than one year after the purchase date of the shares, or upon death of the participant while holding the shares, the participant will recognize taxable ordinary income equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the disposition over the purchase price of the shares, or (b) 15% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant of the option, and any additional taxable gain on the disposition will be treated as long-term capital gain. If the shares are disposed of before the expiration of the holding periods described above, the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date over the purchase price will be taxable as ordinary income, and any gain or loss on such disposition will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The Company is not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxable to a participant, except to the extent of ordinary income reported by the participant on disposition of shares before the expiration of the holding periods described above.
The foregoing is only a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Revised ESPP to participants and does not purport to be complete. Reference should be made to the applicable provisions of the Code. In addition, the summary does not discuss the income tax consequences of a participant's death or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which the participant may reside, and to which the participant may be subject.
Plan Benefits
All employees of the Company who satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in the Revised ESPP may each year purchase up to an amount of Class A common stock equal to the lesser of $25,000 or 10% of their eligible base compensation. Participation in the Revised ESPP is voluntary and each eligible employee will make his or her own decision whether and to what extent to participate. Accordingly, we cannot currently determine the benefits or number of shares that will be received in the future by individual employees or groups of employees. Our non-employee directors are not eligible to participate.
Specific Benefits under the Revised ESPP
The benefits that will be received by or allocated to eligible employees under the Revised ESPP cannot be determined at this time because whether an eligible employee will participate, and the amount of contributions set aside to purchase shares of our common stock under the Revised ESPP (subject to the limitations discussed above) as to an eligible employee who elects to participate in the Revised ESPP, is entirely within the discretion of each individual participant. If the share increase reflected in this proposal had been in effect in fiscal 2018, we do not expect that the number of shares purchased by participants in the plan during fiscal 2018 would have been materially different than the number of shares purchased as set forth below.
For fiscal years ending in 2018, 2017, and 2016, the number of shares of our common stock purchased under the ESPP were 143,227 shares, 90,881 shares and 94,909 shares, respectively. However, because the number of shares purchased under the ESPP in any particular period may change based on any number of variables, including, without limitation, changes in the fair market value of our common stock, the number of eligible employees who elect to participate in the Revised ESPP and the amount of payroll deductions elected by the eligible employees who participate, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by employees if the Revised ESPP is approved by shareholders or how long the additional 1,500,000 shares proposed to be authorized under the Revised ESPP will last, but we expect the additional 1,500,000 shares proposed to be authorized under the ESPP will last 11 years based on current practices and other factors.
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  49
The closing price of a share of our common stock as of February 28, 2019 was $90.27 per share.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal is required to approve this proposal. 
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR approval of the adoption of the ESPP, as amended and restated.

            PROPOSAL NO. 6 
Ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm for the Year Ending December 31, 2019
We Engaged KPMG After a Rigorous Review Process
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has appointed KPMG, LLP, independent registered public accountants, as auditor for the year ending December 31, 2019. As the Company's independent auditor, KPMG is responsible to audit, and express an opinion on, our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting and to discuss with our Audit Committee certain required matters and other matters deemed appropriate.
KPMG has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 1993. Before reappointing KPMG as the Company's independent auditor for 2019, the Audit Committee carefully considered KPMG's qualifications as an independent registered public accounting firm. This included a review of KPMG's performance in prior years, its knowledge of the Company and its operations as well as its reputation for integrity and competency in the fields of accounting and auditing. 
The Audit Committee believes that retaining KPMG again in 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and therefore the Audit Committee requests that shareholders ratify the appointment. If the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is not ratified by shareholder vote, the Audit Committee may appoint another independent registered public accounting firm or may decide to maintain its appointment of KPMG. A representative of KPMG is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. The representative will be given the opportunity to make a statement on behalf of his or her firm if such representative desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. KPMG served as the Company's independent accountants for the year ended December 31, 2018, and reported on the Company's consolidated financial statements for that fiscal year.
The Audit Committee believes that, if handled properly, there are numerous benefits of a long-term independent auditor relationship, including:
HIGHER AUDIT QUALITY: Through 26 years of experience with the Company KPMG has gained institutional knowledge of and deep expertise regarding our operations and primary business segments, accounting policies and practices and internal controls over financial reporting;
EFFICIENT FEE STRUCTURE: KPMG's aggregate fees are competitive with peer companies because of KPMG's familiarity with the Company and industry expertise; and
AVOIDANCE OF DISRUPTION: Onboarding a new independent auditor requires a significant time and cost commitment that could distract from management's and the Audit Committee's focus on financial reporting and internal controls. 
The Company and the Audit Committee are also aware that a long-tenured auditor may be believed by some to pose an independence risk. To address these concerns, there are safeguards for auditor independence, including:
AUDIT COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT: The Audit Committee's oversight includes regular private sessions with KPMG, discussions with KPMG regarding the scope of its audit, an annual evaluation when determining whether to engage KPMG, and direct involvement by the Audit Committee and its Chair in the periodic transition to a new lead engagement partner in connection with the mandatory five-year rotation of that position;
LIMITS ON NON-AUDIT SERVICES: The Audit Committee pre-approves audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by KPMG in accordance with its pre-approval policy; and
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: Because KPMG is an independent registered public accounting firm, it is subject to PCAOB inspections, peer reviews and PCAOB and SEC oversight.

Non-audit services and fees are evaluated by the Audit Committee in assessing the auditor's independence.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting and entitled to vote on this matter is necessary to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors and is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to: (a) the preparation and integrity of the Company's financial statements; (b) the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, the annual evaluation of their performance, qualifications and independence, and negotiation of fees; (c) the implementation and evaluation of the Company's internal accounting and financial controls, procedures and policies; and (d) the compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements, including programs and policies established by management or our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee is composed solely of independent directors. The Audit Committee regularly reviews financial information contained in the Company's quarterly earnings releases, and reviews the appropriateness of non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company. The current Audit Committee charter is available on our website at www.lithia.com.
In discharging our responsibilities, we have met with the Company's management and its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, to review the Company's accounting functions and the audit process. We have also met regularly with the Company's Director of Internal Audit to review the nature and extent of the Company's internal controls, the review procedures performed by internal audit regarding such controls and the frequency and results of such reviews. We note that follow up procedures are in place to monitor any corrective actions that have been recommended.
Selection of KPMG as our Auditor
The Audit Committee selects, oversees and evaluates the performance of the independent auditor. In selecting KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered that KPMG has been our auditor for 26 years, KPMG's global reach and auto retail industry expertise. The Audit Committee also utilized the Center for Audit Quality's External Auditor Assessment Tool to assist in evaluating KPMG as our independent auditor. This tool is used annually by the Audit Committee.
Consistent with requirements, the audit partner and concurring review partner rotate at least every five years. A new lead partner rotated on in 2017. The Audit Committee selects the lead partner.
Audit Committee Actions
We hereby report that the Audit Committee has:
1. Reviewed and discussed with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, together and separately, the Company's audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2018 fiscal year; 
2. Discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees issued by the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board regarding communications with Audit Committees; and
3. Received from KPMG the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding KPMG's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with KPMG its independence and any relationships that may impact their objectivity and independence.
We also discussed and reviewed the results of the independent registered public accounting firm's audit of the Company's financial statements, the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and issues relating to auditor independence.
Based on our review and discussions with the Company's management and independent registered public accountants, we recommended to our Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Certain Relationships and Transactions with Related Persons
The Audit Committee, or another appropriate independent committee, and, where appropriate, our Board of Directors review all transactions between us and any related person, which includes, all of our nominees for director, directors and executive officers and their immediate family members and all persons known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of our voting securities and their immediate family members, that exceed $120,000 and in which the related person has a direct or indirect material interest. Although we do not maintain a written policy or have written procedures for such review, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics imposes an obligation on each of our directors and senior executive officers to disclose any potential conflict of interest involving such person and Lithia. Further, each of our directors and each NEO signs a detailed questionnaire used in the preparation of this proxy statement that requires the disclosure of, among other things, any related-person transaction. The Audit Committee or other independent committee and our Board of Directors review and determine whether to approve or disapprove all such transactions based on (i) whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to us than the terms generally made available by us to an unaffiliated third party under similar circumstances and (ii) the extent of the related party's interest in the proposed transaction.
Sidney B. DeBoer is the father of Bryan B. DeBoer, who is a Director and our Chief Executive Officer, and Mark DeBoer, who is the Company's Vice President of Real Estate. George C. Liang is the brother of William Liang who is a Group Leader in the DCH operations group. There are no other family relationships between our executive officers and directors.
On September 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Transition Agreement with Sidney B. DeBoer, the Chairman of the Company, to reflect Mr. DeBoer's changing role at the Company. Under the agreement, effective December 31, 2015, Mr. DeBoer ceased to be an executive officer of the Company, and the Company ceased paying Mr. DeBoer a base salary and making contributions to his account under the Company's Executive Management Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and Long-Term Incentive Plan. Mr. DeBoer also ceased to be eligible to participate in performance-based compensation arrangements, including under the Company's Performance Bonus Plan and under its Stock Incentive Plan. Under the Transition Agreement the Company pays Mr. DeBoer annual amounts for his prior services rendered as an employee of the Company equal to $1,050,000 and a $42,000 car allowance, and the Company will reimburse Mr. DeBoer for amounts payable under the four split-dollar insurance policies described below in this section. A Special Meeting of Shareholders was held on January 21, 2019, where 99.95% of voting shareholders agreed that adding a sunset to the Transition Agreement was in the best interests of the shareholders. Under the amendment to the Transition Agreement that adds the sunset, the Transition Agreement ends on the earlier of Mr. DeBoer's death or December 31, 2035. Mr. DeBoer had agreed that if the amendment to the Transition Agreement was approved by shareholders, he would execute a formal Class B Conversion Agreement whereby Mr. DeBoer would agree to cause all of the remaining shares of Class B common stock to be converted into shares of Class A common stock on or before December 31, 2025. Mr. DeBoer voted his shares as "abstain" at the meeting. On January 22, 2019, Mr. DeBoer executed the amendment to the Transition Agreement and the Class B Conversion Agreement. 
The Company entered into a Director Service Agreement, effective January 1, 2016, with Sidney B. DeBoer. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to pay Mr. DeBoer in cash a prorated portion of $210,000 (the cash equivalent of the annual amount paid to non-employee directors for the 2015-2016 service year) until the Board of Directors changes the compensation payable to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Thereafter, for so long as Mr. DeBoer serves as a member of the Board of Directors, the Company 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  57
will pay him the same compensation, in the same form (cash or equity), as the Company pays to its non-employee directors (as that amount is established by the Board of Directors from time to time).
We maintain 10 separate "whole-life" insurance policies covering Sidney B. DeBoer, each worth $3,727,600 on maturity. With respect to four of the 10 policies, Mr. DeBoer has the right to designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the death benefit of each policy. Lithia owns and pays the premium for each of the four policies, and pursuant to the amended Transition Agreement described below, Lithia will continue to pay the premiums for each of the four policies until the earlier of Mr. DeBoer's death or December 31, 2035. Lithia will receive the greater of the cash surrender value or cumulative premiums paid at the maturity of each policy.
In 2018, Mark DeBoer, Vice President of Real Estate, received a salary of $414,000, incentive compensation of $166,000, and other compensatory arrangements totaling $16,552.
William Liang, DCH Operations Platform Vice President covering parts of New Jersey, is paid an annual base salary of $241,599 and participates in an incentive compensation plan provided to our other Group Leaders based on store net profits. In 2018, Mr. Liang earned $255,408 in total compensation.

[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.5, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes (A) is untrue in any material respect (or omits a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading), (B) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any individual, corporation, partnership, association or other entity, organization or governmental authority, (C) would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or listing standard of the stock exchange on which shares of the Corporation's capital stock are listed, or (D) would, if included in the Corporation's proxy statement, impose a material risk of liability upon the Corporation. Additionally, nothing in this Section 1.5 limits the Corporation's ability to solicit against and include in its proxy statement its own statements relating to any Shareholder Nominee.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  66
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) if one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date and before the date of the applicable annual meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the reduced size of the Board of Directors;  
(2) any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation's proxy statement for a particular meeting of shareholders but either: (i) withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the meeting, or (ii) does not receive a number of votes cast in favor of his or her election at least equal to 25% of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote on the Shareholder Nominee's election, shall be ineligible to be included in the Corporation's proxy statement as a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to this Section 1.5 for the next annual meeting of shareholders following the meeting for which the Shareholder Nominee has been nominated for election;  
(3) any director in office as of the nomination deadline who was included in the Corporation's proxy statement as a Shareholder Nominee for any of the three preceding annual meetings and whom the Board of Directors decides to nominate for election to the Board of Directors also will be counted against the Permitted Number; and 
(4) any Eligible Shareholder submitting more than one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall rank such Shareholder Nominees based on the order in which the Eligible Shareholder desires such Shareholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement in the event that the total number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.5 exceeds the Permitted Number. In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.5 exceeds the Permitted Number, the highest ranking Shareholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 1.5 from each Eligible Shareholder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation's capital stock each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its Notice. If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Shareholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 1.5 from each Eligible Shareholder has been selected, then the next highest ranking Shareholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section 1.5 from each Eligible Shareholder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement, and this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.       
(l) Eligibility of Eligible Shareholder; Shareholder Groups. An Eligible Shareholder must have owned (as defined below) continuously for at least three years a number of shares that represents 3% or more of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors (the "Required Shares") as of (i) the date the Notice is delivered to or received by the Corporation in accordance with this Section 1.5, (ii) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, and (iii) the date of the annual meeting. For purposes of satisfying the ownership requirement under this Section 1.5, the voting power represented by the shares of the Corporation's capital stock owned by one or more shareholders, or by the person or persons who own shares of the Corporation's capital stock and on whose behalf any shareholder is acting, may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and other persons whose ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose may not exceed 20; and each shareholder or other person whose shares are aggregated must have held such shares continuously for at least three years. 
[END TABLE]
Whenever an Eligible Shareholder consists of a group of shareholders and/or other persons, all requirements and obligations for an Eligible Shareholder set forth in this Section 1.5 must be satisfied by and as to each such shareholder or other person in the group, except that shares may be aggregated to meet the Required Shares. With respect to any one particular annual meeting, no shareholder or other person may be a member of more than one group of persons constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 1.5, and if any shareholder appears as a member of more than one group, the shareholder will be deemed to be a member of only the group that has the largest ownership position as reflected in the relevant Notice. If any shareholder that is a member of a group of shareholders and/or other persons collectively constituting an Eligible Shareholder ceases to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 1.5, as determined by the Board of Directors, or withdraws from a group of shareholders constituting an Eligible Shareholder before the annual meeting of shareholders, the Eligible Shareholder will be deemed to only own the shares held by the remaining members of the group.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(m) Funds. A group of two or more funds shall be treated as one shareholder or person under this Section 1.5 provided that the other terms and conditions in this Section 1.5 are met (including Section 1.5(h)(8)(i)) and the funds are:

(2) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer (or by a group of related employers that are under common control); or  
(3) a "group of investment companies," as that term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
(n) Ownership. For purposes of this Section 1.5, an Eligible Shareholder is deemed to "own" only those shares as to which the person possesses both full voting and investment rights and full economic interest (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss); provided that the number of shares will not include any shares: 
(1) sold by such person or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed,  
(2) borrowed by such person or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such person or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, 
(3) that were entered into short positions or otherwise sold short, or  
(4) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative, or similar agreement entered into by such person or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of the Corporation's capital stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of: (A) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such person's or affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares; and/or (B) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such person or affiliate. 
[END TABLE]
An Eligible Shareholder "owns" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Shareholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Shareholder's ownership of shares continues during any period in which the Eligible Shareholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. An Eligible Shareholder's ownership of shares continues during any period in which the Eligible Shareholder has loaned such shares, provided that (A) the Eligible Shareholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days' notice and recalls such loaned shares promptly after being notified that any of its Shareholder Nominees will be included in the Corporation's proxy statement, and (B) the Eligible Shareholder holds the recalled shares through the annual meeting. The terms "owned," "owning," and other variations of the word "own" have correlative meanings. For purposes of this Section 1.5, the term "affiliate" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(i) within five business days after the record date for the meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying the Eligible Shareholder's continuous ownership of the Required Shares through the record date, and

ARTICLE 2. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Section 2.1 Number and Election of Directors. The Board of Directors will consist of not less than five members and not more than nine members. The number of directors will be established within this range from time to time by the Board of Directors. A decrease in the number of directors will not have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. At each annual meeting, the shareholders will elect directors by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election. Each director will be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until the election and qualification of a successor, subject to prior death, resignation or removal. 
Section 2.2 Vacancies. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or unless previously filled by the vote of at least a majority of the total number of votes represented by the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (voting together as a single class), any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including both a vacancy resulting from removal of a director or from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum. Any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve until the next annual shareholders meeting and until the successors have been elected and qualified, subject to prior death, resignation or removal. 
Section 2.3 Annual Meeting.

The provisions of Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 of the Bylaws will also apply to all committees of the Board of Directors. Each committee will keep written records of its activities and proceedings. All actions by committees will be reported to the Board of Directors at the next meeting following the action and the Board of Directors may ratify, revise or alter such action, provided that no rights or acts of third parties will be affected by any such revision or alteration.

APPENDIX  2
First Amendment to Restated Articles of Incorporation
If this Proposal 4 is approved by shareholders, Article IV, Section 1 of the Restated Articles of Incorporation will be amended to read in its entirety as follows:
"Section 1. Election of Directors.
(a) Except to the extent that these Restated Articles of Incorporation grant to the holders of any series of preferred stock the right (voting separately by class or series) to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors of the corporation shall be as fixed from time to time by or pursuant to the Bylaws of the corporation. The election of directors need not be by written ballot unless required by the Bylaws of the corporation.
(b) At each annual meeting of shareholders the shareholders shall elect the directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified, subject to prior death, resignation or removal. If the directors shall not have been elected at any annual meeting of shareholders, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by the Bylaws of the corporation.
(c) Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article IV and in this subsection 1(c), each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director. The following shall not be votes cast: (1) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (2) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (3) a share otherwise present at the meeting for which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In a contested election, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.
A contested election is one in which (1) on the last day for delivery of a notice pursuant to Article 1 of the Bylaws of the corporation for any shareholder nomination of a nominee for the Board of Directors, a shareholder has complied with the applicable nomination requirements regarding one or more nominees; and (2) prior to the date that notice of the meeting is given, the Board has not made a determination that none of the candidacies of such nominees creates a bona fide election contest. For purposes of this Section 1, it is assumed that on the last day for delivery of a notice under Article 1 of the Bylaws of the corporation, there is a candidate nominated by the Board of Directors for each of the director positions to be voted on at the meeting. The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not receive a majority vote shall not be elected. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an incumbent director not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote shall continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of (x) 180 days after the date on which an inspector determines the voting results as to that director pursuant to Section 60.223 of the Oregon Business Corporation Act; (y) the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by such director, which appointment shall constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board  pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Bylaws of the corporation; or (z) the date of the director's resignation. Any vacancy resulting from the nonelection of a director under this Section 1 may be filled by the Board as provided in Section 2.2 of the Bylaws. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, or any successor thereto, will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee failing to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, or any successor thereto, and within 180 days after the certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. Except as provided in the next sentence, no director who failed to receive a majority vote for election will participate in the Nominating and Governance Committee (or any successor thereto) recommendation or Board of Directors decision about filling his or her office. If no director receives a majority vote in an uncontested election, then the incumbent directors (i) will nominate a slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees as soon as practicable, and (ii) may in the interim fill one or more offices with the same director(s) who will continue in office until their successors are elected."

Section 1.3 Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Annual Meetings of Shareholders. 
(1) Only business properly brought before an annual meeting of shareholders, including nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors, may be conducted at the meeting.  To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be brought pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting or any supplement to the Corporation's notice of meeting; 
(i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or 
(ii) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (A) was a shareholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf the business is proposed, only if the beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares) of the Corporation when the notice provided for in this Section 1.3 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, (B) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.3(a)(2)-(3). This clause (ii) is the exclusive means for a shareholder to nominate director candidates or submit or propose other business before an annual meeting of shareholders, except that, if the Corporation has a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), a proposal or nomination properly brought under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act that is included in the Corporation's notice of meeting satisfies the notice requirements set forth in these Bylaws.  
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(1)(ii), the shareholder must have given timely written notice of the nomination or other business to the Corporation's Secretary, and the other business must be a proper matter for shareholder action as determined by the Board of Directors.

The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of shareholders does not commence a new time period, or extend any time period, for the giving of a shareholder's notice described above.  The shareholder's notice must set forth the information required by Section 1.3(c) or it will not be considered timely. 
[END TABLE]

(b) Special Meetings of Shareholders.   
(1) The only business that may be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders is the business described in the Corporation's notice of meeting.

(2) If a special meeting of shareholders is called to elect one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any shareholder entitled to vote in the election of directors may nominate a person or persons, as the case may be, for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting if the shareholder's notice required by Section 1.3(c) with respect to any nomination, including the completed and signed questionnaire and representation and agreement required by Section 1.3(c)(4), is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than 10 days following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at the meeting.  An adjournment or the public announcement of a postponement of a special meeting does not commence a new time period, or extend any time period, for the giving of a shareholder's notice described above. 
(c) Information Required in Shareholder Notice.  A shareholder notice given pursuant to this Section 1.3 must contain the following information: 
(1) as to each person the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re‑election as a director:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

ARTICLE 2. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Section 2.1 Number and Election of Directors. The Board of Directors will consist of not less than five members and not more than nine members. The number of directors will be established within this range from time to time by the Board of Directors. A decrease in the number of directors will not have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. At each annual meeting, the shareholders will elect directors by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election. Each director will be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until the election and qualification of a successor, subject to prior death, resignation or removal. 
Section 2.2 Vacancies. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or unless previously filled by the vote of at least a majority of the total number of votes represented by the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (voting together as a single class), any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including both a vacancy resulting from removal of a director or from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum. Any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve until the next annual shareholders meeting and until the successors have been elected and qualified, subject to prior death, resignation or removal. 
Section 2.3 Annual Meeting. An annual meeting of the Board of Directors will be held without notice immediately after the adjournment of the annual meeting of the shareholders or at another time designated by the Board of Directors upon notice in the same manner as provided in Section 2.5. The annual meeting will be held at the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place as the Board of Directors may designate. 
Section 2.4 Regular Meetings. The Board of Directors may provide by resolution for regular meetings. Unless otherwise required by such resolution, regular meetings may be held without notice of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting. 
Section 2.5 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the President, the Chief Executive Officer or any member of the Board of Directors. Notice of each special meeting will be given to each director, either by oral or in written notification actually received not less than 24 hours prior to the meeting or by written notice mailed by deposit in the United States mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address appearing on the records of the Corporation not less than 72 hours prior to the meeting. Special meetings of the directors may also be held at any time when all members of the Board of Directors are present and consent to a special meeting. Special meetings of the directors will be held at the principal office of the Corporation or at any other place designated by a majority of the Board of Directors. 
Section 2.6 Telephonic Meetings. The Board of Directors may permit directors to participate in a meeting by any means of communication by which all of the persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in such a meeting will constitute presence in person at the meeting. 
Section 2.7 Waiver of Notice. A director may, at any time, waive any notice required by these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Oregon Business Corporation Act. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.7, the waiver must be in writing, must be signed by the director, must specify the meeting for which notice is waived, and must be delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes and filing in the corporate records. A director's attendance at a meeting waives any required notice, unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon the director's arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to any action taken at the meeting. 
Section 2.8 Quorum. A majority of the number of directors that has been established by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 of these Bylaws will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  82
Section 2.9 Voting. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will for all purposes constitute the act of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. 
Section 2.10 Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at a Board of Directors meeting may be taken without a meeting if a written consent, or consents, describing the action taken is signed by each director and included in the minutes and filed with the corporate records. The action is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date. A consent signed under this section has the effect of an act of the Board of Directors at a meeting and may be described as such in any document. 
Section 2.11 Removal of Directors. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation, the shareholders, at any meeting of the shareholders called expressly for that purpose, may remove any director from office, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the total number of votes represented by the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 
Section 2.12 Powers of Directors. The Board of Directors will have the sole responsibility for the management of the business of the Corporation. In the management and control of the property, business and affairs of the Corporation, the Board of Directors is vested with all of the powers possessed by the Corporation itself, so far as this delegation of power is not inconsistent with the Oregon Business Corporation Act, the Articles of incorporation, or these Bylaws. The Board of Directors will have the power to determine what amount constitutes net earnings of the Corporation, what amount will be reserved for working capital and for any other purpose, and what amount, if any, will be declared as dividends. Such determinations by the Board of Directors will be final and conclusive except as otherwise expressly provided by the Oregon Business Corporation Act or the Articles of Incorporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more officers of the Corporation who will have the power to sign all deeds, leases, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust and other instruments and documents executed by and binding upon the Corporation. In the absence of a designation of any other officer or officers, the Chief Executive Officer is so designated. 
Section 2.13 Committees. Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, a majority of the Board of Directors may designate from among its members an Executive Committee and any number of other committees. Each committee must consist of two or more directors and will have such powers and will perform such duties as may be delegated and assigned to the committee by the Board of Directors. No committee will have the authority of the Board of Directors with respect to (a) approving dividends or other distributions to shareholders, except as permitted by (h), below, (b) amending the Articles of Incorporation, except as permitted by (j), below (c) adopting a plan of merger, (d) recommending to the shareholders the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Corporation other than in the usual and regular course of its business, (e) recommending to the shareholders a voluntary dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation thereof, (f) approving or proposing to shareholders other actions required to be approved by the shareholders, (g) approving a plan of merger which does not require shareholder approval, (h) authorizing or approving any reacquisition of shares of the Corporation, except pursuant to a formula or method prescribed by the Board of Directors, (i) authorizing or approving the issuance, sale or contract for sale of shares of the Corporation's stock except either pursuant to a stock option or other stock compensation plan or where the Board of Directors has determined the maximum number of shares and has expressly delegated this authority to the committee, (j) determining the designation and relative rights, preferences and limitations of a class or series of shares, unless the Board of Directors has determined a maximum number of shares and expressly delegated this authority to the committee, (k) adopting, amending or repealing Bylaws for the Corporation, or (l) filling vacancies on the Board of Directors or on any of its committees or (m) taking any other action which the Oregon Business Corporation Act prohibits a committee of a board of directors to take. The provisions of Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 of the Bylaws will also apply to all committees of the Board of Directors. Each committee will keep written records of its activities and proceedings. All actions by committees will be reported to the Board of Directors at the next meeting following the action and the Board of Directors may ratify, revise or alter such action, provided that no rights or acts of third parties will be affected by any such revision or alteration. 
Section 2.14 Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors may elect one of its members to be Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Chairman will advise and consult with the Board of Directors and the officers of the Corporation as to the determination of policies of the Corporation, will preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of the shareholders, and will perform such other functions and responsibilities as the Board of Directors may designate from time to time.

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
7.GRANTING OF OPTION TO PURCHASE STOCK.
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.1 Quarterly Grant of Options.  For each Fiscal Quarter, on the first day of the Fiscal Quarter a Participant will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase as many whole shares as may be purchased with the payroll deductions credited to the Participant's Account during the Fiscal Quarter (together with any payroll deductions from the previous Fiscal Quarter retained in the Participant's Account as of the end of such Fiscal Quarter as provided in Section 8.1 and any cash dividends paid during the Fiscal Quarter as provided in Section 8.2). 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.2 Option Price.

[END TABLE]
8.EXERCISE OF OPTION.
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.1 Automatic Exercise of Options.  Unless a Participant has elected to withdraw payroll deductions in accordance with Section 10, the Participant's option for the purchase of Common Stock will be deemed to have been exercised automatically as of the last day of the Fiscal Quarter for the purchase of the number of whole shares of Common Stock which the accumulated payroll deductions (and cash dividends on the Common Stock as provided in Section 8.2) in the Participant's Account at that time will purchase at the applicable option price.  No fractional shares may be issued under the Plan.  As of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, the balance of each Participant's Account shall be applied to purchase the number of whole shares of Common Stock as determined by dividing the balance of such Participant's Account as of such date by the option price determined pursuant to Section 7.2.  Any amounts accumulated in a Participant's Account during a Fiscal Quarter under Section 5.1 that are not sufficient to purchase a full share of Common Stock at the end of such Fiscal Quarter shall be retained in the Participant's Account for the subsequent Fiscal Quarter, subject to earlier withdrawal by the Participant as provided in Section 10.  The Participant's Account shall be debited accordingly.  The Committee or its delegate shall make all determinations with respect to applicable currency exchange rates when applicable. 
8.2 Dividends Generally.  Cash dividends paid on shares of Common Stock which have not been delivered to the Participant pending the Participant's request for delivery pursuant to Section 9.3, will be combined with the  
[END TABLE]
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  93
Participant's payroll deductions and applied to the purchase of Common Stock at the end of the Fiscal Quarter in which the cash dividends are received, subject to the Participant's withdrawal rights set forth in Section 10.  Dividends paid in the form of shares of Common Stock or other securities with respect to shares that have been purchased under the Plan, but which have not been delivered to the Participant, will be credited to the shares that are credited to the Participant's Account.
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.3 Pro-rata Allocation of Available Shares.  If the total number of shares to be purchased under option by all Participants exceeds the number of shares authorized under Section 4, a pro-rata allocation of the available shares will be made among all Participants authorizing such payroll deductions based on the amount of their respective payroll deductions through the last day of the Fiscal Quarter. 
[END TABLE]
9.OWNERSHIP AND DELIVERY OF SHARES.
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.1 Beneficial Ownership.  A Participant will be the beneficial owner of the shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan on exercise of an option and will have all rights of beneficial ownership in such shares.  Any dividends paid with respect to such shares will be credited to the Participant's Account and applied as provided in Section 8 until the shares are delivered to the Participant. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.2 Registration of Stock.  Stock to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of the Participant, or if the Participant so directs by written notice to the designated Benefits Representative or brokerage firm, if any, prior to the purchase of Stock hereunder, in the names of the Participant and one such other person as may be designated by the Participant, as joint tenants with rights of survivorship or as tenants by the entireties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Any such designation shall not apply to shares purchased after a Participant's death by the Participant's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 11.2.  If a brokerage firm is engaged by the Company to administer Accounts under the Plan, such firm shall provide such account registration forms as are necessary for each Participant to open and maintain a brokerage account with such firm. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.3 Delivery of Stock Certificates.  The Company, or a brokerage firm or other entity selected by the Company, shall deliver to each Participant a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Participant hereunder as soon as practicable after the close of each Fiscal Quarter.  Alternatively, in the discretion of the Committee, the stock certificate, or other written documentation or notice of electronic transfer evidencing such stock ownership, may be delivered to a designated stock brokerage account maintained for the Participant and held in "street name" in order to facilitate the subsequent sale of the purchased shares. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.4 Regulatory Approval.  In the event the Company is required to obtain from any commission or agency the authority to issue any stock certificate hereunder, the Company shall seek to obtain such authority.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any such commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance of any such certificate shall relieve the Company from liability to any Participant, except to return to the Participant the amount of his Account balance used to exercise the option to purchase the affected shares. 
[END TABLE]
10.WITHDRAWAL OF PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.  At any time during a Fiscal Quarter, but in no event later than 15 days (or such shorter prescribed by the Committee or a Benefits Representative) prior to the last day of the Fiscal Quarter, a Participant may elect to abandon his election to purchase Common Stock under the Plan.  By written notice to the designated Benefits Representative on a form provided for such purpose, the Participant may thus elect to withdraw all of the accumulated balance in his Account being held for the purchase of Common Stock in accordance with Section 8.  Partial withdrawals will not be permitted.  All such amounts will be paid to the Participant as soon as administratively practical after receipt of his notice of withdrawal.  After receipt and acceptance of such withdrawal notice, no further payroll deductions will be made from the Participant's Total Pay beginning as of the next payroll period during the Fiscal Quarter in which the withdrawal notice is received.  The Committee, in its discretion, may determine that amounts otherwise withdrawable hereunder by Participants shall be offset by an amount that the Committee, in its discretion, determines to be reasonable to help defray the administrative costs of effecting the withdrawal, including, without limitation, fees imposed by any brokerage firm which administers such Participant's Account.  After a withdrawal, an otherwise eligible Participant may resume participation in the Plan as of the first day of the Fiscal Quarter next following his delivery of a payroll deduction authorization pursuant to the procedures prescribed in Section 5.1.

In the event of a merger of one or more corporations into the Company, or a consolidation of the Company and one or more other corporations in which the Company is the surviving corporation, each Participant, at no additional cost, shall be entitled, upon his payment for all or part of the Common Stock purchasable by him under the Plan, to receive (subject to any required action by shareholders) in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which he was entitled to purchase, the number and class of shares of stock or other securities to which such holder would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement of merger or consolidation if, immediately prior to such merger or consolidation, such holder had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares purchasable by the Participant hereunder.
If the Company is not the surviving corporation in any reorganization, merger or consolidation (or survives only as a subsidiary of an entity other than a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), or if the Company is to be dissolved or liquidated or sell substantially all of its assets or stock to another corporation or other entity, then, unless a surviving corporation assumes or substitutes new options (within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Code) for all options then outstanding, (i) the date of exercise for all options then outstanding shall be accelerated to dates fixed by the Committee prior to the effective date of such corporate event, (ii) a Participant may, at his election by written notice to the Company, either (x) withdraw from the Plan pursuant to Section 10 and receive a refund from the Company in the amount of the accumulated cash and Stock balance in the Participant's Account, (y) exercise a portion of his outstanding options as of such exercise date to purchase shares of Stock, at the option price, to the extent of the balance in the Participant's Account, or (z) exercise in full his outstanding options as of such exercise date to purchase shares of Stock, at the option price, which exercise shall require such Participant to pay the related option price, and (iii) after such effective date any unexercised option shall expire.  The date the Committee selects for the exercise date under the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be the exercise date for purposes of computing the option price per share of Stock.  If the Participant elects to exercise all or any portion of the options, the Company shall deliver to such Participant a stock certificate issued pursuant to Section 9.4 for the number of shares of Stock with respect to which such options were exercised and for which such Participant has paid the option price.  If the Participant fails to provide the notice set forth above within three days after the exercise date selected by the Committee under this Section 16, the Participant shall be conclusively presumed to have requested to withdraw from the Plan and receive payment of the accumulated balance of his Account.  The Committee shall take such steps in connection with such transactions as the Committee shall deem necessary or appropriate to assure that the provisions of this Section 16 are effectuated for the benefit of the Participants.
Except as expressly provided in this Section 16, the issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property, or for labor or services either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Stock then available for purchase under the Plan.
17.PLAN EXPENSES; USE OF FUNDS; NO INTEREST PAID.  The expenses of the Plan shall be paid by the Company except as otherwise provided herein or under the terms and conditions of any agreement entered into between the Participant and any brokerage firm engaged to administer Accounts.  All funds received or held by the Company under the Plan shall be included in the general funds of the Company free of any trust or other restriction, and may be used for any corporate purpose.  No interest shall be paid to any Participant or credited to his Account under the Plan.
18.TERM OF THE PLAN.  The Plan shall become effective upon the approval of the Plan by the holders of the majority of the Common Stock present and represented at a special or annual meeting of the Company's shareholders held on or before 12 months after adoption of this Plan by the board of directors.  Except with respect to options then outstanding, if not terminated sooner under the provisions of Section 19, no further options shall be granted under the Plan at the earlier of (i) December 31, 2029, or (ii) the point in time when no shares of Stock reserved for issuance under Section 4 are available.
19.AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.  The Board shall have the plenary authority to terminate or amend the Plan; provided, however, that the Board shall not, without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, (i) increase the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the Plan pursuant to Section 4, (ii) materially amend the requirements as to the class of employees eligible to purchase Stock under the Plan, or (iii) permit the members of the Committee to purchase Stock under the Plan.  No termination, modification, or amendment of the Plan shall adversely affect the rights of a Participant with respect to an option previously granted to him under such option without his written consent.
In addition, to the extent that the Committee determines that, in the opinion of counsel, (i) the listing for qualification requirements of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Company's Common Stock is then listed or quoted, or (ii) the Code or Treasury regulations issued thereunder, require shareholder approval in order to maintain compliance with such 
2019 Lithia Motors, Inc. Proxy Statement  |  97
listing or qualification requirements or to maintain any favorable tax advantages or qualifications, then the Plan shall not be amended by the Board in such respect without first obtaining such required approval of the Company's shareholders.
20.SECURITIES LAWS RESTRICTIONS ON EXERCISE.  The Committee may, in its discretion, require as conditions to the exercise of any option that the shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the option shall have been duly listed, upon official notice of issuance, upon a stock exchange, and that either (i) a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to said shares shall be effective; or (ii) the Participant shall have represented at the time of purchase, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that it is his intention to purchase the Stock for investment and not for resale or distribution.
21.SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE.  The Plan, and transactions hereunder by persons subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b 3 or any successor exemption provision promulgated under the Exchange Act.  To the extent that any provision of the Plan or any action by the Committee or the Board fails, or is deemed to fail, to so comply, such provision or action shall be null and void but only to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee in its discretion.
22.WITHHOLDING TAXES FOR DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION.  Whenever shares of Stock that were received upon the exercise of an option granted under the Plan are disposed of within two years after the date of grant of such option or one year from the date of exercise of such option (within the meaning of Section 423(a)(1)), the Company shall have the right to require the Participant to remit to the Company in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding and payroll tax requirements, if any, attributable to such disposition prior to authorizing such disposition or permitting the delivery of any certificate or certificates with respect thereto.
23.NO RESTRICTION ON CORPORATE ACTION.  Subject to Section 19, nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Board or any Employer from taking any corporate action which is deemed by the Employer to be appropriate or in its best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on the Plan or any option granted under the Plan.  No Employee, beneficiary or other person shall have any claim against any Employer as a result of any such action.
24.USE OF FUNDS.  The Employers shall promptly transfer all amounts withheld under Section 6 to the Company or to any brokerage firm engaged to administer Accounts, as directed by the Company.  All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company will not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.
