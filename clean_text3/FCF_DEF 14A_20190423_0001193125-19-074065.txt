FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     5 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the Company's business and affairs. The Board measures the effectiveness of its oversight using a balanced scorecard which is comprised of three themes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leadership and Accountability – the Board's responsibility for appointing and retaining strong and qualified  leaders and holding those leaders accountable for corporate performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strategic Direction and Execution – the Board's responsibility to approve the Company's strategy and oversee  its execution by management; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Risk Oversight – the Board's responsibility to establish the Company's risk appetite and ensure that the  Company's strategies and risk management practices are aligned with the risk appetite.  
[END TABLE]
Sound corporate governance provides the foundation which enables the Board to effectively carry out these responsibilities. This section discusses First Commonwealth's corporate governance policies and practices, as well as the composition of the Board and its standing committees. 
Corporate Governance Policies 
The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which codify our corporate governance policies and reflect our commitment to following corporate governance best practices. Below is a summary of the significant guidelines that we follow. 
Separation of Chairman and CEO. We believe that the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be held by separate persons and that the Chairman of the Board should be an independent director. This separation establishes an appropriate division of the Board's oversight role from the management responsibilities of the officers and employees of the Company. Consistent with this principle, our current Chairman, David S. Dahlmann, is a non-executive independent director. 
Majority Voting in Director Elections. Under our Corporate Governance Guldelines, any director who does not receive a majority of votes cast "for" his or her election in an uncontested election must tender his or her resignation promptly following the failure to receive the required vote. Within 90 days of the certification of the shareholder vote, the Governance Committee would then be required to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the Board should accept the resignation, and the Board would be required to decide whether to accept the resignation and to disclose its decision-making process. 
Director Independence. We believe that all directors other than the Chief Executive Officer should be independent from management. All of our directors other than the Chief Executive Officer currently satisfy the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), as described below under "Independence of Directors." 
Executive Sessions. Our Board and committees regularly meet in executive session without management present, and our non-management directors meet regularly without the Chief Executive Officer. This enables directors to provide candid feedback, raise concerns and discuss sensitive or confidential matters. Our Chairman, David S. Dahlmann, has also been designated as our Lead Director to preside at meetings of the non-management directors. 
Stock Ownership. We believe that directors should hold a meaningful investment in the Company's stock to ensure that their interests are aligned with our shareholders. Our guidelines require that all directors own shares having a value of at least $130,000 (five times the annual cash retainer) or 25,000 shares, whichever is less. This guideline must be met within five years of a director's initial election to the Board. Directors receive 50% of their annual retainer in shares of Company stock; however, directors who own shares having a value of $400,000 or greater may elect to receive their full retainer in cash. 
Director Orientation and Education. All new directors and committee members receive orientation to learn about the Company and its strategic plans, significant financial, regulatory, accounting and risk management matters and policies and compliance programs. Our current directors regularly participate in continuing education to maintain the skills necessary to perform their duties and responsibilities and to keep abreast of industry trends, legal and regulatory developments and corporate governance practices. 
6    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
Performance Evaluations. Our Board and committees regularly evaluate and discuss their performance. In addition, our Board performs a peer evaluation from time to time to provide directors with a confidential forum to assess and provide candid feedback regarding their own performance and the performance of fellow directors. The Board and its committees use the results of these evaluations to identify opportunities to enhance performance and topics for director continuing education. 
Retirement Age. We have established a mandatory retirement age of 75 for our directors. No candidate may be nominated for election as a director if he or she would be age 75 or older at the time of the election. 
Meeting Frequency and Attendance. Directors are expected to attend Board meetings and meetings of committees on which they serve and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. Last year, our Board met nine times. All of our directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and all committees of which they were members. 
Annual Meeting Attendance. The annual meeting provides an opportunity for shareholders to meet and interact with our directors. All directors are expected to attend the annual meeting in the absence of an unavoidable conflict. Last year all of our directors attended the annual meeting. 
Composition and Diversity of the Board 
We believe that our Board should generally consist of between 10 and 15 directors. This range permits diversity of experience and sharing of Board and committee responsibilities without hindering effective governance. However, the Board may increase its membership beyond 15 to accommodate an exceptional candidate or operate with fewer than 10 directors if a vacancy arises. 
We believe that effective oversight requires that the Board possess a diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and skills. The Governance Committee considers the diversity of the professional experience, education, expertise, viewpoints, background and other demographics when evaluating the current composition of the Board and the need for additional directors and when identifying and evaluating director nominees. The Governance Committee is also guided by a set of criteria that has been approved by the Board of Directors. Under these criteria, a director candidate should: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• possess a sustained record of high achievement in financial services, business, industry, government, academia, the  professions, or civic, charitable or non-profit organizations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards and personal qualities that will help to  sustain an atmosphere of mutual respect and collegiality among the members of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have the strength of character necessary to challenge management's recommendations and actions when appropriate and to  confirm the adequacy and completeness of management's responses to such challenges to his or her satisfaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• understand or demonstrate a commitment to understand First Commonwealth, including our strategic vision, our mix of  businesses and our approach to regulatory relations and risk management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have a commitment and sufficient time to devote to our affairs, including regularly attending and participating in meetings  of the Board and at least one standing committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair his or her ability to represent the interests of our  shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director.  
[END TABLE]
When assessing each current director for possible nomination and re-election, the Governance Committee considers all of the criteria listed above, as well as the needs of the Board, the independence of the director, the director's meeting attendance and participation, and the value of the director's contributions to the effectiveness of our Board and its committees. 
Independence of Directors 
The rules of the NYSE require that at least a majority of our Board of Directors be comprised of independent directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that all directors other than the Chief Executive Officer must meet the independence standards established by the NYSE. 
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     7 
The Board reviews all relationships between the Company and its directors at least once per year and assesses each director's independence annually using the NYSE independence standards. The Board has determined that a director may be independent even if he or she has business relationships with First Commonwealth or one of its affiliates, as long as, in the Board's business judgment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any transaction involving the director is entered into in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same  terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the relationship complies with all applicable laws and regulations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the relationship would not interfere with the director's exercise of judgment independent from management of First  Commonwealth.  
[END TABLE]
Based upon these criteria, the Board has determined that directors Caponi, Charley, Claus, Dahlmann, Gorney, Glass, Greenfield, Johnson, Latimer, Ventura and Wolfe and director nominee Oliphant are independent. 
When evaluating the independence of Mr. Latimer, the Board considered the lease transaction between First Commonwealth Bank and SML Limited Partnership described below under the heading "Related Party Transactions," and concluded that the transaction did not impact the independence of Mr. Latimer because the amount paid to SML Limited Partnership during 2018 fell below the quantitative limits established by the NYSE independence rules and was not otherwise material to Mr. Latimer or First Commonwealth. 
Oversight of Risk 
The Board of Directors actively oversees the risk management practices employed by First Commonwealth and its management team. The Board receives regular reports from our Chief Risk Officer regarding material risk exposures and the actions taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. In addition, senior management updates the Board at its regular meetings regarding trends and developments for credit, market, liquidity, compliance, reputation, operational and strategic risk. Our Risk Committee provides risk oversight for the Board as a dedicated forum to review and discuss risks and risk management policies and practices. In addition, the Credit Committee of the First Commonwealth Bank Board of Directors oversees the Bank's lending operations and the quality and performance of its loan portfolios. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is comprised of Julie A. Caponi (Chair), Gary R. Claus, Laurie S. Singer and Robert J. Ventura, each of whom is an independent director under our Guidelines and the NYSE and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") standards. The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to monitor the integrity of our financial statements, select and oversee our independent registered public accounting firm, oversee our internal audit process, monitor our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including the receipt and resolution of complaints concerning accounting, internal controls and auditing matters, and review and discuss major financial risk exposures with management and steps taken to monitor and control those exposures, including risk assessments and risk management policies. Each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate, and our Board has determined that Directors Caponi and Claus qualify as "audit committee financial experts" as defined by the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee met ten times in 2018. A report of the Audit Committee follows on page 17. 
Compensation and Human Resources Committee 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee is comprised of Robert J. Ventura (Chair), Ray T. Charley, Gary R. Claus and David W. Greenfield. The primary responsibilities of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are to review and determine the compensation of the CEO and other executive officers, lead the annual review of the performance of the CEO, develop and approve the CEO succession plan and oversee succession and development planning for the other executive officers, establish and oversee executive compensation and employee benefit programs, and review and approve the terms of any employment, severance, change of control or similar agreement for our CEO and other 
8    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement executive officers. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee met seven times during 2018. Each member of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee is an independent director under our Guidelines and applicable NYSE standards. A report of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee follows on page 33. 
Governance Committee 
The Governance Committee is comprised of David W. Greenfield (Chair), Ray T. Charley, Luke A. Latimer, and Laurie S. Singer. The primary responsibilities of the Governance Committee are to identify and recommend director nominees to the Board of Directors, recommend directors to serve as members and as chair for each committee of the Board, determine director compensation, lead the annual review of the performance of the Board and its committees, recommend and approve corporate governance policies and practices for the Board, and review and approve related party transactions and monitor compliance with our Code of Conduct and Ethics, insider trading and related policies. Each member of the Governance Committee is an independent director under our Guidelines and applicable NYSE standards. The Governance Committee met six times during 2018. 
Risk Committee 
The Risk Committee is a joint committee of the Boards of Directors of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation and First Commonwealth Bank and is comprised of Jon L. Gorney (Chair), David S. Dahlmann, Johnston A. Glass, Bart E. Johnson and Stephen A. Wolfe. The primary responsibilities of the Risk Committee are to oversee and review information regarding our enterprise risk management framework, review and approve our significant risk management policies, assess the risks associated with our compensation practices, review and discuss with management the level and trend of risk exposures, including credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and legal, reputation and strategic risk, and assess risks associated with strategic and operating plans and strategic initiatives. Each member of the Risk Committee is an independent director under our Guidelines and applicable NYSE standards. The Risk Committee met eight times during 2018. 
Code of Conduct and Ethics 
The Code of Conduct and Ethics governs the actions and working relationships of First Commonwealth employees, officers and directors. This Code addresses, among other items, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, fair dealing, protection and proper use of corporate assets and compliance with laws, rules and regulations. The Code of Conduct and Ethics encourages and provides a process for the reporting of any illegal or unethical behavior. First Commonwealth has established an ethics hotline to allow employees, officers and directors to anonymously report any known or suspected violation of laws, rules or regulations or the Code of Conduct and Ethics.

PROPOSAL 2 – RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the independent auditors of First Commonwealth and our subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019. KPMG LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. As part of that consideration, during 2018, the Audit Committee conducted a competitive selection process to determine the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. As a result of that process, the Audit Committee decided to approve the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP for 2019. 
In selecting Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the professional qualifications of Ernst & Young LLP, the lead partner and other key engagement partners;

[END TABLE]
At the annual meeting, shareholders will be asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as First Commonwealth's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Although shareholder approval is not required, the Board desires to obtain shareholder ratification of this appointment. If the appointment is not ratified at the annual meeting, the Board will review its future selection of auditors. If the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of First Commonwealth and its shareholders. No formal statement by representatives of KPMG LLP or Ernst & Young LLP is anticipated at the Annual Meeting. However, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions. 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of First Commonwealth's common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting is necessary for ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.

AUDIT INFORMATION 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee of First Commonwealth's Board of Directors operates under a written charter that specifies the Audit Committee's duties and responsibilities. This charter is available on First Commonwealth's website at www.fcbanking.com by following the links to "Investor Relations" and "Corporate Governance." 
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the system of internal controls, including internal control over financial reporting, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. First Commonwealth's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for the integrated audit of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and procedures. The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to the Audit Committee and on the representations made by management regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee also relies on the opinions of the independent auditors on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of First Commonwealth as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with First Commonwealth's management and KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP the firm's independence from the Company and management, and has received the written disclosures and the communication from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Committee concerning independence. In addition, the Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the required communications of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees. 
Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in First Commonwealth's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by First Commonwealth's independent auditors in order to assure that the provision of those services does not impair the accounting firm's independence. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services by First Commonwealth's independent auditors and requires that the independent auditor be engaged for non-audit services only when it is best suited for the job. This policy allows the Audit Committee to pre-approve services through general pre-approval or specific pre-approval. 
Under general pre-approval, the Audit Committee approves in advance the payment of up to a specified amount of fees for the performance of specified types of audit, audit-related, tax and other services by the independent auditors. The term of general pre-approval is generally twelve (12) months from the date of pre-approval. Any services that are not subject to general pre-approval or fees in excess of pre-approved limits must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case basis. Pre-approved fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided by the independent auditors are established annually by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditors to management. However, the pre-approval policy allows the Audit Committee to delegate to one or more designated members of the Audit Committee the authority to grant required pre-approvals. The decision of any member to whom authority is delegated to pre-approve an activity is presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement and the tabular disclosures regarding named executive officer compensation, together with the accompanying narrative disclosure, allow shareholders to view the trends in compensation and application of our compensation philosophies and practices for the years presented.

RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation's named executive officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and in the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation (together with the accompanying narrative disclosure) in this proxy statement. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee and the Board will take the outcome of the vote into account when considering future executive compensation arrangements.

Executive Summary 
We seek to align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders. We believe it is important to incent and reward executives for corporate and individual performance, with a clear emphasis on corporate performance. We maintain a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy with an executive compensation program having both short-term and long-term performance-based awards, including a significant equity component and a significant portion of at-risk compensation. 
Consistent with our longstanding compensation practices, performance-based cash and equity awards in 2018 constituted a significant portion of the compensation for our named executive officers. Our short-term performance goals for 2018 required the Company to achieve double-digit growth of core EPS and core ROA, a core Efficiency Ratio that surpassed management's below-60% target and performance that met or exceeded the consensus estimate of analysts. Our long-term performance goals for the 2016-2018 performance cycle required the Company to achieve sustained earnings per share growth and deliver total return to shareholders that outperformed our peers. These performance goals advanced strategic objectives that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders without encouraging undue risk taking or imprudent actions by our executive officers.

Composition and Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board is comprised of four directors: Robert Ventura (Chairman), Ray Charley, Gary Claus and David Greenfield. Each member of the Committee is an "independent director" for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards for compensation committee members. The Committee operates under a written charter that is reviewed and approved annually by the Board. A copy of this charter is available under the "Investor Relations – Corporate Governance" section of our website, http://www.fcbanking.com. 
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and evaluate First Commonwealth's general compensation philosophy and oversee the development and  implementation of its compensation policies and programs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• determine the CEO's salary, bonus and other incentive and equity compensation and review and approve the individual  and corporate goals assigned to the CEO and evaluate the performance of the CEO in light of those goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approve the salary, bonus and other incentive and equity compensation of the other executive officers and review and  approve the individual and corporate goals assigned to the executive officers and the CEO's evaluation of the performance of the executive officers in light of those goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• make recommendations to the Board with respect to incentive and equity-based compensation plans that are subject to Board  approval, oversee the administration and carry out the Committee's responsibilities under such plans, including the approval of awards of equity-based compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• oversee First Commonwealth's succession planning and talent management processes.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee relies upon performance data, statistical information and other data regarding executive compensation programs and peer practices provided from time to time by First Commonwealth's Human Resources department, officers and outside advisors. The Committee has access to individual members of 
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     23 
 management and employees and may invite them to attend any Committee meeting. The Committee has the power and discretion to retain, at First Commonwealth's expense, independent counsel and other advisors and experts as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its duties. 
Independent Compensation Advisor 
Board Advisory LLC has served as the Committee's compensation advisor since 2010. Board Advisory provides the Committee with peer executive compensation data, as well as expertise and advice on various matters brought before the Committee. Board Advisory also provides data and advice relating to non-employee director compensation to the Governance Committee. As part of its engagement in 2018, Board Advisory was asked to facilitate the Board's evaluation of the CEO, evaluate our performance and compensation against the performance and compensation of our peer group and make recommendations regarding the design of executive incentive compensation plans. The analysis provided by Board Advisory is described under "Peer Comparisons" and elsewhere in this CD&A. 
The Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate Board Advisory as its compensation consultant and approve fees and other engagement terms. The Committee has determined that Board Advisory is independent from management based upon the consideration of relevant factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that Board Advisory does not provide any services to the Company except advisory services to the Committee and the  Governance Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that the amount of fees received from the Company by Board Advisory is not material as a percentage of Board  Advisory's total revenue;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that Board Advisory has policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that Board Advisory and its employees who provide services to the Committee do not have any business or personal  relationship with any member of the Committee or any executive officer of the Company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that Board Advisory and its employees who provide services to the Committee do not own any stock of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
Role of Executives in Establishing Compensation 
The CEO plays a significant role in the design and implementation of our compensation program for all executive officers other than himself. His role includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• making recommendations on performance measures and goals for our incentive plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluating executive officer performance and overseeing succession and development planning for executive officers;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• making recommendations regarding corporate titles, base salaries, annual and long-term incentive award opportunities and  other employment terms for executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing background information for Committee meeting agenda items.  
[END TABLE]
The CEO generally attends Committee meetings, but he is not present during executive sessions of the Committee at which his performance and compensation are discussed. Other members of management also attend meetings from time to time at the request of the Committee to provide reports and information on agenda topics. 
Peer Comparisons 
The Committee reviews a peer compensation assessment annually as a market check for the Company's executive pay and performance. This assessment is performed using compensation data provided by Board Advisory. The peer group is intended to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serve as a point of reference for defining the range of competitive pay practices, including the range of target total pay  opportunities appropriate for First Commonwealth executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
24    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serve as a point of reference in understanding the relative expense burden associated with First Commonwealth executive  officer pay;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• help the Committee to assess pay-related talent risk by providing transparent pay  data from those companies most likely to attract First Commonwealth's executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• help the Committee test the alignment of actual pay delivered relative to Company performance and calibrate future payouts.   
[END TABLE]
The compensation peer group selected by the Committee is comprised of 16 publicly traded commercial banks with headquarters in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and total assets generally between $4 billion and $15 billion, which is roughly one-half to double First Commonwealth's asset size. Three members of the 2017 peer group were removed in 2018 because they exceed the upper end of the target size: FNB Corporation, Chemical Financial Corporation, and United Bankshares Inc. The companies within the compensation peer group are listed below.

[END TABLE]
In assessing the pay-for-performance relationship, the Committee considers the historic realizable pay provided by the Company to its CEO and other NEOs in relation to the Company's performance. Realizable pay consists of actual base salary and annual cash incentives paid, the fair market value of full-value share grants and payouts (or shares earned) under long-term incentive plans for a specified performance period. The Committee believes this is a more accurate reflection of the actual compensation delivered to the NEOs than the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table, which include a mix of actual pay and unearned long-term pay opportunities. 
The following is a summary of the key findings from the Committee's 2018 peer compensation assessment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Excluding the CEO, the Company's executive pay cost structure approximates competitive levels. Individual non-CEO executive target compensation levels are competitive with peers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The CEO's base salary remains below the peer group median, which negatively impacts the CEO's target annual cash  incentive and LTIP awards. However, after taking into account special equity awards and share price appreciation, realizable pay approximates the peer median.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive share ownership is approaching peer levels, and executive officers are exceeding guideline ownership levels.   
[END TABLE]
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     25

As these charts illustrate, the CEO's realizable pay remained commensurate with Company performance over the same three-year time period.

Executive Compensation Philosophy and Strategy 
Overall Objective 
The Committee believes that the continued success of the Company in achieving its strategic objectives depends in large part on the talent and leadership of its executives and the alignment of those executives with the interests of our investors. Accordingly, the Committee's philosophy toward executive compensation can be summarized as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive Compensation. We will provide compensation opportunities to executive  officers that, in the aggregate, reflect the median practices of similarly-sized banks in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, adjusted for individual variance in skill and  contribution.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-Performance. To earn  competitive total pay levels, executive officers will be required to meet financial and operating objectives derived from internal business plan objectives as well as outperform our peer group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Link Compensation to Talent and Accountability. To attract, retain and develop superior  talent, we assess the leadership skills and professional competence of executive officers as part of our overall assessment of individual performance. Executives are held individually accountable for providing leadership to the organization and  achievement of individual internal financial and non-financial objectives, as well as identifying and developing successors. Results of this assessment serve as input to Committee deliberations over salary  increases and incentive adjustments and as input to related management selection and employment discussions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Promote Long-Term Share Ownership. We use share ownership to support risk management  efforts, balancing demands for short term results with long term consequences. All long term incentive awards are paid with shares of Company stock, and all executives are expected to maintain a significant investment in the Company in accordance  with our share ownership and retention guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
26    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide Reasonable Income Security. We provide change of control agreements to our  executive officers consistent with industry standards and competitive requirements. These agreements are designed to foster stability and retain well-qualified executives by providing reasonable income protection upon termination of employment  following a change of control. All agreements are "double trigger," requiring both a change of control and the loss of employment, and no agreement provides for any gross-up of taxes.

FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     27 
CEO Compensation versus Core EPS Growth 
Compensation Positioning and Mix 
First Commonwealth strives to maintain an executive compensation package (both individual components and in the aggregate) that is competitive with the market. While the targeted pay level is set to provide competitive pay for meeting expected performance, the actual pay level (by component and in the aggregate) varies based on performance relative to goals and industry performance over both short- and long-term timeframes. In the aggregate, the objective of First Commonwealth's total compensation program is to provide a balanced mix of fixed and variable (i.e., incentive / performance) and cash and equity compensation. The target mix of compensation will vary based on the executive's role, and the actual mix will vary based on performance. For example, in a year when no annual incentive is paid, the percentage of total compensation paid in salary will increase, while in a year of strong corporate performance, incentive compensation would represent a larger percentage of total compensation. 
The Committee generally targets incentive compensation to represent at least 50% of the total compensation opportunity for the CEO and 35% to 45% of the total compensation opportunity of other NEOs. 
Below is a table that reflects the mix of each element of target compensation as well as compensation at risk as percentages of target total compensation as of December 31, 2018. Compensation at risk is comprised of short and long-term incentives. Approximately 51% of our CEO's and 43% of our other NEOs' target compensation in 2018 was subject to performance and/or vesting requirements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Other NEOs (Average)    57%    21%    22%    43% 
[END TABLE]
Elements of Compensation 
The compensation program for our NEOs consists of base salary, cash and equity-based incentive compensation and other benefits. Each of these elements of compensation is described below. 
Base Salary 
We provide base salaries to compensate our NEOs for services performed during the year. Base salaries further our objectives of attracting and retaining executive talent and providing compensation that is competitive with our peers. Base salary directly affects the size of our Annual Incentive Plan awards, because we express AIP awards as a percentage of salary. 
28    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
Base salaries for executive officers are determined by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluating the responsibilities of the position held and the experience of the individual; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Considering the competitive marketplace for executive talent, primarily through a comparison to base salaries for  comparable positions with companies in our regional and national peer groups.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee typically reviews and approves base salaries annually as part of the performance review process as well as upon promotion or other change in job responsibility. Adjustments to base salaries, within a range of competitive practices, are determined primarily by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance of the executive's business unit or area of responsibility, based upon measures contained in business  unit scorecards and the success of business unit operating initiatives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An evaluation of the executive's personal development, which includes an assessment of his or her individual skills  and attributes through a formal performance evaluation and progress on individual development objectives.  
[END TABLE]
Incentive Compensation 
In order to align pay with corporate performance, the Committee seeks to appropriately balance fixed compensation with variable, or "at risk," incentive compensation that is contingent on performance and the financial success of the organization. 
For 2018, the NEOs and certain other key executives participated in two incentive compensation plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annual incentive plan, or AIP, which provides for the payment of annual cash awards based on the attainment of annual  corporate and individual performance measures, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a long-term incentive compensation plan, or LTIP, which provides performance-based equity compensation determined by the  attainment of corporate performance measures relative to the Company's peers over a rolling three-year period and time-vesting restricted stock units.  
[END TABLE]
Each plan includes performance goals with "threshold," "target" and "superior" performance levels. The threshold level represents the minimum acceptable level of performance to earn an award under the particular performance goal. The Committee considers our budget, peer performance, growth percentages and the consensus estimate of covering analysts when establishing the target level of performance under our AIP. The superior performance level generally reflects stretch targets for the corporate performance goals. To achieve the target performance level in our LTIP, the Company's performance must meet or exceed the median of a national peer group comprised of all United States banks and thrifts having total assets between 50% and 200% of the Company's total assets. The threshold level requires performance above the first quartile and the superior level requires performance within the top quartile of the national peer group. The Committee has discretion to consider unusual factors and their resulting effect on our performance, such as merger and acquisition transactions, the impact of share repurchase activity on the achievement of performance goals, strategic decisions that have an adverse impact on near-term results such as conversion-related expenses, unusual investment gains or losses, corporate and balance sheet restructuring, significant asset sales and other items it deems appropriate in determining the extent of which we achieve our performance goals. 
Our incentive compensation plans are intended to align our executives' financial interests with those of our investors. The combination of annual and long-term incentives is intended to balance our desire to achieve strong financial results over the short term with the need to employ prudent and sustainable growth strategies. 
Benefit Programs and Perquisites 
The NEOs participate in employee benefit programs available to all other eligible employees of First Commonwealth, including our 401(k) plan, and group medical, life and disability insurance. In addition, First Commonwealth maintains a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan that is designed to restore benefits that are not available to them under our 401(k) plan as highly compensated employees, according 
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     29 
 to rules of the IRS. Under the terms of this Plan, each participant may contribute up to 25% of his or her base salary and up to 100% of his or her annual incentive payment to the Plan. There are presently no employer matching contributions under this Plan. 
The Company pays for certain members of senior management (including certain NEOs) to belong to one or more private clubs as a venue to entertain customers and to participate in various community functions. Expenses of a personal nature or related to a spouse are not paid by the Company. 
The Company offers our executive officers (including NEOs) the opportunity to receive financial planning and tax preparation services from a third-party to assist with their personal finances. Providing this service gives our executive officers a better understanding of their pay and benefits, allowing them to concentrate on the Company's future success. 
If the Company hires or initiates a transfer of an employee, including an NEO, and requires a relocation of more than 50 miles, the employee may be eligible for reimbursement of the costs of house hunting trips, closing on the sale of the old home and the purchase of the new home, temporary living quarters and moving household goods and furniture. In these circumstances the Company will also gross up taxable relocation reimbursements for applicable taxes. 
The Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to executive officers (including the NEOs). The Committee believes the perquisites and other personal benefits provided by the Company are consistent with the Company's philosophy of attracting and retaining superior executive talent. 
Agreements with Executives 
We provide employment and change of control agreements to certain executive officers (including the NEOs) to promote stability and continuity of executive officers and ensure their interests are aligned with shareholders. Terms of these agreements consider marketplace practices and First Commonwealth's unique needs and are tailored to the individual executive with a focus on retention and recruitment. The change of control agreements contain a "double trigger," providing benefits only upon an involuntary termination or constructive termination of the executive officer in connection with a change of control. The agreements do not provide for any tax gross-ups payments upon a change of control event. The Committee considers change of control agreements to be necessary in the current financial services industry legal, regulatory and economic environment. Details on employment agreements and change of control agreements are included under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" on page 38. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Committee has established stock ownership guidelines to encourage Company share ownership by our executive officers (including the NEOs) through retention of shares granted under the Company's incentive plans. The stock ownership guidelines are summarized in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive Officer      3X 
 Other Executive Officers      1X 
[END TABLE]
Executives are not required to purchase shares to reach these ownership guidelines. However, executives are restricted from selling shares received as equity-based compensation (net of required withholding tax) until the guidelines are achieved. Furthermore, executives are required to retain at least 50% of shares earned under equity-based compensation plans (net of required withholding tax) once the guidelines have been met. The Committee believes that these stock ownership guidelines, coupled with the use of equity-based compensation, will increase the level of executive stock ownership over time, which will further align the interests of our executives with shareholders. 
30    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
All of our executive officers (including the NEOs) are currently in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. 
Policy Regarding Derivatives, Short Sales and Hedging 
First Commonwealth's policy prohibits directors and officers (including the NEOs) from pledging shares on margin, trading in derivative securities of First Commonwealth's common stock, engaging in short sales of First Commonwealth securities, or purchasing any other financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of First Commonwealth securities.

 Matthew C. Tomb      $320,000      $285,000 
[END TABLE]
Annual Incentive Plan 
The Committee approved AIP participation for the NEOs in February 2018. The 2018 AIP utilized corporate performance measures to maximize the alignment between executive incentive pay and corporate performance. The Committee retained earnings per share (EPS), ROA and efficiency ratio as corporate performance measures. The Committee also retained an individual performance component for those executive officers with risk management responsibilities (our Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive) with a weighting of 30%. 
The table below lists the performance goals for the 2018 AIP and their respective weightings and threshold, target and superior performance levels, and results: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Core EPS   $0.94   $1.00   $1.06   $1.10   40%   50%    
 Core ROA   1.23%   1.31%   1.39%   1.44%   15%   25%

 Individual Performance   Varies by participant   See below   30%   0%     
[END TABLE]
In 2018, First Commonwealth's core performance improved compared to 2017 and exceeded budget and AIP targets due to strong loan and non-interest income growth, net interest margin expansion, lower credit costs and a lower corporate income tax rate. Core EPS and Core ROA performance each exceeded the Superior performance level, and Core Efficiency Ratio fell between the target and superior performance

 levels. The Committee determined that Mr. Karrip achieved his individual goals at 150% of the target performance level having met the superior performance level for both provision expense and non-performing assets. The Committee determined that Mr. Tomb achieved his individual goals at 150% of the target performance level having met the superior performance levels for legal expense management and internal and external audits and examinations. Based on the corporate and individual performance, in January 2019, the Committee approved a payout under the AIP to each of the NEOs between the target and superior performance levels. In accordance with the terms of the AIP, each NEO received a cash payment as set forth in the table below.

The vesting of the restricted stock units was based upon First Commonwealth's achievement of the following three performance goals: (1) cumulative EPS for the performance period; (2) total return to shareholders ("TRS") in relation to the peer group during the performance period; and (3) annual EPS. In 2018, the Committee increased the cumulative EPS performance levels to offset the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate in 2018. In January 2019, the Committee assessed First Commonwealth's performance in comparison to the performance goals. The Committee determined that it was appropriate to exclude merger costs and the charge relating to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset for purposes of measuring EPS performance. 
The table below lists the performance goals for the 2016-2018 LTIP and their respective weightings and threshold, target and superior performance levels, and results: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Cumulative EPS   35%   $1.92   $2.32   $2.54   $2.614   70% 
 TRS Relative to Peers   35%   35th%ile   55th%ile   75th%ile   89th%ile   70% 
 Annual EPS   30%   n/a   $0.56/yr   n/a   Earned   30% 
[END TABLE]
Based upon these results, in January 2019 the Committee determined that each participant earned 170% of his or her target share award. 
2018-2020 LTIP 
In February 2018, the Committee established a LTIP for the three-year performance cycle from 2018 through 2020. Awards under the 2018-2020 LTIP consist of 50% time-vesting restricted stock units which vest in a single installment on the third anniversary of the award and 50% performance-vesting restricted stock units. The Committee replaced cumulative EPS with Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) compared to peers as a performance measure for the 2018-2020 LTIP. The Committee concluded that 
[BEGIN TABLE]
4   Cumulative EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes one-time acquisition costs and a charge incurred in 2017  related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  
[END TABLE]
32    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement relative ROTCE is more directly aligned with the interests of shareholders than cumulative EPS. The Committee retained three-year TRS compared to peers as the second performance measure and maintained equal weighting for both performance measures. The peer group for measuring performance under the 2018-2020 LTIP is comprised of all publicly traded United States banks and thrifts having total assets greater than or equal to 50% and less than or equal to 200% of the total assets of the Company as of December 31, 2020. The number of shares that may be earned for the TRS and relative ROTCE performance goals ranges from 40% of the target award for threshold performance to 200% of the target award for superior performance. 
Tax Treatment of Compensation 
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limited to $1 million the U.S. federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid in one year to a company's CEO or any of its three next-highest-paid executive officers (other than its Chief Financial Officer). Grandfathered performance-based compensation is not subject to this limit on deductibility so long as such compensation meets certain requirements, including shareholder approval of material terms. The Committee strived to provide the NEOs with incentive compensation programs that preserved the tax deductibility of compensation paid by First Commonwealth, to the extent reasonably practicable and consistent with the Committee's other compensation objectives. The Committee believes, however, that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in structuring compensation programs, even though such programs may result in non-deductible compensation expenses. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the deductibility exemption for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) has been eliminated. As a result, compensation in excess of  $1,000,000 paid to covered executive officers generally will not be deductible. 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Our shareholders approved, in an advisory vote, the compensation of our NEOs at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. The advisory vote received the support of 95.6% of the votes cast (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). While the Committee considered the results of this advisory vote to be overwhelmingly favorable, it did not speculate as to the intent of the shareholders or otherwise consider the advisory vote when making decisions regarding the compensation of our NEOs. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth in the preceding pages of this proxy statement, and based on such review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in which each named executive officer may contribute up to 25% of his or her base salary and, beginning in 2018, up to 100% of his or her annual incentive payment. Amounts held in the plan may be invested at the discretion of the executive in First Commonwealth stock and eligible mutual funds. Plan assets are generally distributed in a lump sum following the later of the termination of the officer's employment or the attainment of age 62. Amounts held in the plan are not subject to vesting or forfeiture. The following table presents executive and employer contributions, aggregate earnings, withdrawals and distributions and year-end balance for each of the named executive officers for 2018:

Compensation Policies and Practices Relating to Risk Management 
As a financial services institution, our objective is to effectively understand and manage our risk exposures and to ensure we are compensated appropriately for the risks that we take. Incentive plans play an important role in our success by providing specific rewards for achievement of goals, while balancing the risks we undertake with asset quality and safety and soundness considerations. We follow the following compensation policies and practices to ensure that we achieve this balance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of our incentive plans have explicit provisions that allow First Commonwealth to recover any amounts paid to an  employee as a result of erroneous or intentionally misrepresented data.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our corporate banking incentive plans provide the Company with the right to recover any payments made to an employee in  respect of loans that are downgraded to non-accrual status or charged off within 24 months after origination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our corporate banking incentive plans have explicit credit quality disqualifiers, which can reduce or eliminate an  incentive otherwise earned if the employee fails to follow established portfolio management requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All sales and service incentives, including all incentives relating to the sale of loan and  line-of-credit products, are capped at a performance level reflecting strong but achievable results, at total earnings levels that are within a range of competitive pay  levels.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All sales and service incentive plans are reviewed annually and must be approved by a panel of executive officers.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All incentives are monitored by our Human Resources department for compliance with documentation, risk profile and credit  quality requirements.  
[END TABLE]
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     37 
In addition, management performs an annual assessment of First Commonwealth's incentive plans in order to determine the extent to which the incentives could potentially encourage excessive risk taking by our employees or otherwise expose the organization to risks that could destroy shareholder value or jeopardize the safety and soundness of First Commonwealth Bank. This assessment is reviewed by the Risk Committee and Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. In 2018, the assessment was conducted by our Chief Risk Officer and our Assistant Compensation Manager. These officers reviewed incentive designs, performance metrics, and resulting performance/payout relationships for positions where incentives for individual behavior could potentially create an incentive for excessive risk taking, as well as mitigating controls in the design and administration of incentive plans. The assessment concluded that our compensation policies do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk-taking and that the level of risk that they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
First Commonwealth has entered into agreements with certain executive officers and key employees, including each named executive officer, which provide for the payment of severance and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following a change of control. In addition, Mr. Price, Mr. Reske and Ms. Grebenc are parties to employment agreements that entitle these officers to receive severance payments and benefits if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances. These agreements are summarized below. Except as provided in these agreements, First Commonwealth has not agreed to pay severance or provide benefits to any of the named executive officers following the termination of his or her employment. 
Change of Control Agreements 
We have entered into a Change of Control Agreement with each of the Named Executive Officers which entitle the executive to receive severance payments in equal monthly installments over a specified period following the termination of his or her employment if the executive is terminated without "cause" (as defined below) or terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined below) within a specified period following the occurrence of a "change of control" (as defined below) of First Commonwealth, each of which is referred to in the Change of Control Agreements as a "qualifying termination." 
As used in the Change of Control Agreements: (A) "cause" includes (i) the conviction of a felony which results or is intended to result in a loss to the Company or its clients, employees, directors or officers; (ii) the failure to perform the executive's duties with the degree of skill and care reasonably expected of a professional of his or her experience and stature after notice and an opportunity to cure; (iii) acts of dishonesty which result in material damage to the business or reputation of the Company; or (iv) a violation of the terms of the Change of Control Agreement or any Company policy or procedure which is deliberate and results or is intended to result in material damage to the business or reputation of the Company; (B) "good reason" includes (i) the diminution of or assignment of duties which are inconsistent with the position, authority, duties or responsibilities of the executive prior to the change of control; (ii) changing the location of the executive's employment by more than fifty miles or substantially increasing the executive's travel obligations; or (iii) reduction of the executive's base salary or discontinuance of any benefit, welfare or compensation plan or material fringe benefit for the executive; and (C) "change of control" means (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our stock; (ii) a change in the composition of the majority of our Board of Directors (except for nominees who are approved by a majority vote of the incumbent Board); or (iii) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale or similar transaction in which the persons who owned our outstanding shares prior to the transaction do not beneficially own at least 50% of the outstanding shares of the resulting entity. However, the placement of the Company into receivership by the FDIC, the sale of the Company in an FDIC-assisted transaction or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors at the direction of an agency having supervisory authority over us will not constitute a "change of control" for purposes of the Change of Control Agreements. 
The monthly severance payment is calculated as one-twelfth (1/12) of the sum of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive's annual base salary immediately prior to the change of control;  
[END TABLE]
38    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the average of the aggregate amount of all bonuses paid to the executive during the  thirty-six months prior to the change of control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the aggregate amount of all contributions by First Commonwealth for the account of the executive under First  Commonwealth's 401(k) plan during the twelve months prior to the change of control; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the aggregate amount of any contributions by First Commonwealth to the executive's  Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan account during the twelve-months prior to the change of control.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to severance payments, the former executive and his or her family will continue to receive, at the employer's expense, the same level of medical benefits for up to eighteen (18) months following the occurrence of a qualifying termination. 
If the payments and benefits to which the executive is entitled under his or her Change of Control Agreement, either alone or together with any other payments or benefits that he or she is entitled to receive from First Commonwealth, would constitute a "parachute payment" for purposes of section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the payments and benefits will be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by First Commonwealth and subject to the excise taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code for parachute payments. 
The following table sets forth the payments and the value of benefits that each such person would have been entitled to receive if a qualifying termination had occurred following a change of control on December 31, 2018:

Employment Agreement with Mr. Price 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Price in November 2007 when he joined First Commonwealth as President of First Commonwealth Bank, and we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Price when he assumed the position of Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective January 1, 2012. Under the terms of his employment agreement, as amended and restated, Mr. Price is employed for successive one-year terms ending December 31 unless the agreement is terminated by either party upon notice given at least 60 days prior to the end of the current term. The current term of Mr. Price's employment agreement ends December 31, 2019. 
If First Commonwealth terminates Mr. Price's employment other than for "cause" (as defined below) during the term of the agreement or Mr. Price resigns for "good reason" (as defined below) during the term of the agreement, then First Commonwealth will pay Mr. Price severance in an amount equal to one year's base salary, subject to the execution of an agreed form of separation agreement and general release by Mr. Price. As used in Mr. Price's employment agreement: (A) "cause" includes (i) the failure by Mr. Price to comply with any material provision of his employment agreement; (ii) the refusal by Mr. Price to comply with any lawful, written directive from the Board of Directors; (iii) Mr. Price's failure to perform his duties with the degree of skill and care reasonably to be expected of a professional of his experience and stature after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure (unless the failure to perform is incapable of being cured); or 
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     39 
 (iv) any act of dishonesty, fraud or moral turpitude by Mr. Price or the conviction of Mr. Price of a crime which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, renders his continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company; and (B) "good reason" includes (i) a substantial reduction in Mr. Price's title, position or responsibilities; (ii) any reduction in Mr. Price's base salary or a material reduction of benefits (unless such reduction of benefits applies equally to all similarly situated employees of the Company); (iii) the assignment of Mr. Price to a position which requires him to relocate permanently to a site more than fifty (50) miles outside of Indiana, Pennsylvania; or (iv) the assignment to Mr. Price of any duties or responsibilities (other than due to a promotion) which are materially inconsistent with the position of the President and Chief Executive Officer. 
The severance amount is payable in equal periodic installments in accordance with the Company's normal payroll schedule, provided that any installments that would otherwise be payable within six months following Mr. Price's separation from service will be paid on the day following the six-month anniversary of the separation from service. First Commonwealth will also offer continuation coverage to Mr. Price, as required by COBRA, under First Commonwealth's group health plan on the terms and conditions mandated by COBRA and will pay the cost of Mr. Price's COBRA premiums for 12 months following his separation from service. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants which protect the Company during and following the termination of Mr. Price's employment, including: (i) a non-competition covenant which prohibits Mr. Price from serving in certain capacities with competitive businesses for a period of one year following the termination of his employment; (ii) a provision prohibiting Mr. Price from soliciting or hiring our employees for one year following the termination of his employment; and (iii) customary provisions protecting the confidentiality of Company information and requiring the return of documents and information upon the termination of Mr. Price's employment. 
If we had terminated Mr. Price's employment without cause on December 31, 2018, or if Mr. Price had terminated his employment with us for good reason on that date, he would have been entitled to severance payments totaling $474,000 and COBRA premiums having an aggregate value of $15,620 
Employment Agreement with Mr. Reske 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Reske in April 2014 when he joined First Commonwealth as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The term of Mr. Reske's employment agreement automatically renews on March 31 for successive one-year periods unless the agreement is terminated by either party upon notice given at least 60 days prior to the end of the current term. 
If First Commonwealth terminates Mr. Reske's employment other than for "cause" (as defined below) during the term of the agreement or Mr. Reske resigns for "good reason" (as defined below) during the term of the agreement, then First Commonwealth will pay Mr. Reske severance in an amount equal to the product of (x) one-twelfth (1/12) of his base salary multiplied by (y) the greater of (i) twelve months or (ii) the number of months remaining in the term of his employment agreement, subject to the execution of an agreed form of separation agreement and general release by Mr. Reske. As used in Mr. Reske's employment agreement: (A) "cause" includes (i) the failure by Mr. Reske to comply with any material provision of his employment agreement; (ii) the refusal by Mr. Reske to comply with any lawful, written directive from the Board of Directors; (iii) Mr. Reske's failure to perform his duties with the degree of skill and care reasonably to be expected of a professional of his experience and stature after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure (unless the failure to perform is incapable of being cured); or (iv) any act of dishonesty, fraud or moral turpitude by Mr. Reske or the conviction of Mr. Reske of a crime which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, renders his continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company; and (B) "good reason" includes (i) a substantial reduction in Mr. Reske's title, position or responsibilities; (ii) any reduction in Mr. Reske's base salary or a material reduction of benefits (unless such reduction of benefits applies equally to all similarly situated employees of the Company); (iii) the assignment of Mr. Reske to a position which requires him to relocate permanently to a site more than fifty (50) miles outside of Indiana, Pennsylvania; or (iv) the assignment to Mr. Reske of any duties or responsibilities (other than due to a 
40    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement promotion) which are materially inconsistent with the position of the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
The severance amount is payable in equal periodic installments in accordance with the Company's normal payroll schedule, provided that any installments that would otherwise be payable within six months following Mr. Reske's separation from service will be paid on the day following the six-month anniversary of the separation from service. First Commonwealth will also offer continuation coverage to Mr. Reske, as required by COBRA, under First Commonwealth's group health plan on the terms and conditions mandated by COBRA and will pay the cost of Mr. Reske's COBRA premiums for 12 months following his separation from service.

If we had terminated Mr. Reske's employment without cause on December 31, 2018, or if Mr. Reske had terminated his employment with us for good reason on that date, he would have been entitled to severance payments totaling $390,000 and COBRA premiums having an aggregate value of $17,026. 
Employment Agreement with Ms. Grebenc 
We entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Grebenc in May 2013 when she joined First Commonwealth as Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer and President of First Commonwealth Bank. The term of Ms. Grebenc's employment agreement automatically renews on May 31 of each year for successive one-year periods unless the agreement is terminated by either party upon notice given at least 60 days prior to the end of the current term. 
If First Commonwealth terminates Ms. Grebenc's employment other than for "cause" (as defined below) during the term of the agreement or Ms. Grebenc resigns for "good reason" (as defined below) during the term of the agreement, then First Commonwealth will pay Ms. Grebenc severance in an amount equal to the product of (x) one-twelfth (1/12) of her base salary multiplied by (y) the greater of (i) twelve months or (ii) the number of months remaining in the term of her employment agreement, subject to the execution of an agreed form of separation agreement and general release by Ms. Grebenc. As used in Ms. Grebenc's employment agreement: (A) "cause" includes (i) the failure by Ms. Grebenc to comply with any material provision of her employment agreement; (ii) the refusal by Ms. Grebenc to comply with any lawful, written directive from the Board of Directors; (iii) Ms. Grebenc's failure to perform her duties with the degree of skill and care reasonably to be expected of a professional of her experience and stature after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure (unless the failure to perform is incapable of being cured); or (iv) any act of dishonesty, fraud or moral turpitude by Ms. Grebenc or the conviction of Ms. Grebenc of a crime which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, renders her continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company; and (B) "good reason" includes (i) a substantial reduction in Ms. Grebenc's title, position or responsibilities; (ii) any reduction in Ms. Grebenc's base salary or a material reduction of benefits (unless such reduction of benefits applies equally to all similarly situated employees of the Company); (iii) the assignment of Ms. Grebenc to a position which requires her to relocate permanently to a site more than fifty (50) miles outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; or (iv) the assignment to Ms. Grebenc of any duties or responsibilities (other than due to a promotion) which are materially inconsistent with the position of the Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer. 
The severance amount is payable in equal periodic installments in accordance with the Company's normal payroll schedule, provided that any installments that would otherwise be payable within six months following Ms. Grebenc's separation from service will be paid on the day following the six-month anniversary of the separation from service. First Commonwealth will also offer continuation coverage to Ms. Grebenc,

Ratio of CEO Pay to Median Employee Pay 
In accordance with SEC rules, we are reporting the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. We identified the median employee from among all employees as of December 1, 2018. We used gross earnings as reported for the 2018 tax year as the compensation measure to identify the median employee annualizing the gross earnings for each permanent employee (both full time and part time) who was newly hired during the fiscal year. The median employee's annual total compensation for comparison to the CEO's includes such employee's actual base and variable compensation for 2018, including 401(k) contributions, and matching contributions made by us under First Commonwealth's 401(k) plan. The CEO's annual total compensation is the amount reflected for 2018 in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 34.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires First Commonwealth's directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of First Commonwealth's equity securities, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") an initial report of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities of First Commonwealth. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish First Commonwealth with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on First Commonwealth's review of the copies of forms received by it, and written and oral representations from its directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders, First Commonwealth is not aware of any late filings or failures to file Section 16(a) forms during 2018.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships between First Commonwealth or any of its subsidiaries and any of First Commonwealth's executive officers, directors or nominees for election as a director, any person owning more than 5% of First Commonwealth's common stock or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons is considered a "related party transaction" and must be approved or ratified by the Governance Committee in accordance with a written policy adopted by First Commonwealth's Board of Directors. This policy requires the Governance Committee to review the material facts of any related party transaction and either approve or disapprove the transaction after considering, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. Any director who has an interest in the transaction may not participate in any discussion or approval of the transaction except for the purpose of providing material facts concerning the transaction. 
The policy does not apply to the following categories of transactions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transactions that are available to all employees or customers of First Commonwealth generally;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transactions involving less than $120,000 when aggregated with all similar transactions; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• loans made by First Commonwealth Bank (or any other banking subsidiary of First Commonwealth) in the ordinary course of  business, made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender, and not involving more than the normal risk of collectibility or  presenting other unfavorable features.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, certain categories of transactions have been pre-approved under the terms of the policy, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation paid to executive officers of First Commonwealth if either (i) the compensation is required to be  reported in First Commonwealth's proxy statement under the rules of the SEC or (ii) the executive officer is not an immediate family member of another executive officer or director of First Commonwealth and the compensation would be  reported in First Commonwealth's proxy statement if the executive officer was a "named executive officer" (as defined above under "Executive Compensation") and such compensation has been approved by the Compensation and  Human Resources Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation paid to directors that is required to be reported in First Commonwealth's proxy statement; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transactions in which all shareholders benefit proportionately (such as the payment of dividends).  
[END TABLE]
First Commonwealth Bank is a party to a lease agreement with SML Limited Partnership, a real estate holding company of which director Luke A. Latimer is a general partner and owns a 34% interest, for the construction and operation of a branch in New Alexandria, PA. The lease has an initial term of 15 years with three optional renewal terms of five years each. During 2018, First Commonwealth Bank paid $95,173 under the terms of the lease, consisting of $82,800 in base rent and $12,373 for real estate taxes. The aggregate base rent payable from January 1, 2019 through the expiration of the initial 15-year term is $373,200. 
In 2018, certain of our directors and executive officers were customers of, and had banking transactions with, various subsidiaries of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation, including our subsidiary bank First Commonwealth Bank. All relationships between any director or executive officer and First Commonwealth or any of its subsidiaries are conducted in the ordinary course of business. All loans and loan commitments were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with us, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability nor did they present other unfavorable features. We determined that these loans and loan commitments were performing in accordance with their contractual terms.

Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials? 
The SEC notice and access rule allows us to furnish our proxy materials over the internet to our shareholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each shareholder. As a result, on or around March 14, 2019 we sent to most of our shareholders by mail or e-mail a notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the internet and vote online. This notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If you received only a notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the notice or on the website referred to on the notice. 
We provided some of our shareholders, including shareholders who have previously asked to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of a notice that the materials are electronically available over the internet. 
What does the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials look like? 
You will get a document titled "Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to Be Held on April 23, 2019" containing instructions on how to access the proxy statement and the 2018 Annual Report over the Internet, how to request a printed copy of these materials, and how to vote your shares. 
Who can vote? 
Shareholders of record on the record date, which was March 1, 2019, may vote at the annual meeting. As of the record date, there were 98,636,839 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on the proposals?

The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting us to hold the meeting and conduct business. Proxies received but marked as abstentions and broker non-votes (described below under "How do I vote my shares if they are held in the name of my broker?") will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. 
FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement     45 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal? 
Election of Directors: Directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, which means that the thirteen (13) nominees who receive the highest number of votes will be elected. However, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in the circumstance of an uncontested director election, which is the case for this year's directors' election, any director who does not receive a majority of votes cast must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. Upon recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board will determine whether to accept the resignation. Any broker non-votes or abstentions will not be included in the total votes cast and will not affect the director election results. 
Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm: The ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year will be approved if the proposal receives the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by shareholders present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast either for or against the proposal. 
Approval of Named Executive Officer Compensation: The non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers will be approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by shareholders present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast either for or against the proposal. 
How many votes may I cast? 
For the election of directors, you are entitled to cast one vote for each share that you held as of the record date for each candidate nominated. Cumulative voting is not permitted. 
For each other proposal and any other matter brought before the meeting, you are entitled to one vote for each share that you held as of the record date. 
What do I have to do to vote? 
You may vote by granting a proxy, or for shares held in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or other nominee. If your shares are held by a broker or other nominee, you will receive instructions that you must follow to have your shares voted. See below for more information on voting your shares if held in the name of your broker. 
If you hold your shares as the shareholder of record, you may vote by signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it in the postage paid envelope that accompanies the proxy card. You may also submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions provided on the proxy card. 
If you mark the proxy card to show how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you return a signed proxy card but do not mark the proxy card to show how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors as described above. 
In addition, if other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting, the proxy holders are also authorized to vote on such matters as they determine in their sole discretion. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have not received notice of any other matters that may be properly presented at the annual meeting. 
How do I vote my shares if they are held in the name of my broker? 
If your shares are held by your broker, you must vote your shares through your broker. You should receive a form from your broker asking how you want to vote your shares. Follow the instructions on that form to give voting instructions to your broker. 
If you do not give instructions to your broker with respect to the ratification of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm your broker may vote your shares at its discretion on your 
46    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement behalf. If you do not give instructions to your broker with respect to (1) the election of directors or (2) the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, a "broker non-vote" will occur. The broker non-vote will not be counted and no votes will be cast on your behalf. The voting instruction form will provide instructions for you to return it, including instructions for voting by telephone and the Internet. You may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker. 
If you plan to attend the annual meeting and your shares are held in the name of a broker or other nominees, you must bring with you a letter from the broker or nominee confirming your ownership as of the record date. Failure to bring such a letter may prevent you from attending the meeting. 
If you wish to vote your shares at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee and present it to the inspectors of elections with your ballot when you vote at the meeting. 
How do I revoke a proxy or change my vote? 
If you are the record holder of the shares, you may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is counted at the annual meeting by: (1) notifying our Secretary in writing at 601 Philadelphia Street, Indiana, Pennsylvania 15701; (2) attending the annual meeting and voting in person; or (3) submitting a later dated proxy card. If your shares are held by your broker, you should follow the instructions that the broker provides to you to revoke your proxy or change your vote. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
If your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please follow the directions for voting on each of the proxy cards you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
Who pays for the solicitation of proxies? 
First Commonwealth pays all costs related to the Company's solicitation of proxies. We may solicit proxies by mail, or our directors, officers or employees may solicit proxies personally, by telephone, facsimile or the Internet. These persons will not receive any additional compensation for their efforts to solicit proxies. We will request that the notice of annual meeting, this proxy statement, the proxy card and related materials, if any, be forwarded to beneficial owners, and we expect to reimburse banks, brokers and other persons for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in handling these materials.

50    FIRSTCommonwealth   2019 Proxy Statement 
"HOUSEHOLDING" OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. We and some brokers who household proxy materials, may deliver a single proxy statement to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you hold registered shares. You can notify us by sending a written request to Investor Relations, First Commonwealth Financial Corporation, 654 Philadelphia Street, Indiana, PA 15701, or by calling our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner Services LLC, at 1-866-203-5173. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 
A shareholder may obtain a paper copy of this proxy statement, the 2018 Annual Report or any other filing with the SEC without charge by writing to Investor Relations, First Commonwealth Financial Corporation, 654 Philadelphia Street, Indiana, Pennsylvania 15701. Copies of all Company filings with the SEC are available on our website at www.fcbanking.com by following the links to "Investor Relations" and "SEC Filings." 
ACCESSING PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC allows us to deliver proxy materials to shareholders over the Internet. We believe that this offers a convenient way for shareholders to review our information. It also reduces printing expenses and lessens the environmental impact of paper copies. We provided access to our proxy materials beginning on March 14, 2019. On that day, we mailed the Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials and made our proxy materials available on the Internet. 
Any shareholder may access our proxy materials electronically. Upon request, we will continue to provide paper copies of proxy materials to shareholders for the current meeting or for future meetings. 
If you hold our shares in street name, we generally cannot mail our materials to you directly. Your broker or bank must provide you with the Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials or the proxy statement and proxy card, and must also explain the voting process to you. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON APRIL 23, 2019: This Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report are available at: www.envisionreports.com/FCF.
