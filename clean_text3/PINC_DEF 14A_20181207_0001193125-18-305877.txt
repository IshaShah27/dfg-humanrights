PREMIER, INC. 
2018 PROXY STATEMENT 
INTRODUCTION 
The 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Premier, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Premier," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company"), will be held on Friday, December 7, 2018, beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, at our principal executive offices located at 13034 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277. We encourage all of our stockholders to vote at or before the Annual Meeting, and we hope the information contained in this document will help you decide how you wish to vote. 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
What is the purpose of this proxy statement? 
Our Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors" or "Board") is (i) soliciting a proxy from each holder of our Class A common stock to vote on, and (ii) requesting that voting instructions be provided by each holder of our Class B common stock to Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A. with respect to, the items to be considered at the Annual Meeting, which will be held on December 7, 2018. Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee (the "Trustee") of the voting trust (the "Class B Voting Trust") under the Voting Trust Agreement (the "VTA") among Premier, Premier Healthcare Alliance, L.P. f/k/a Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. ("Premier LP"), the holders of our Class B common stock and the Trustee. References herein to "holders of our Class B common stock" or similar phrases are to the beneficial owners of the Class B common stock held by the Trustee pursuant to the VTA. The Trustee is the sole record holder of our Class B common stock. 
This proxy statement and related materials are first being sent to our stockholders on or about October 24, 2018. 
Why did I receive a notice regarding the availability of proxy materials on the Internet? 
Pursuant to the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we are furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders primarily via the Internet rather than mailing paper copies of these materials to each stockholder. We believe that this process expedites stockholders' receipt of the proxy materials, lowers the costs of the Annual Meeting and helps conserve natural resources. On or about October 24, 2018, we will mail to each stockholder (other than those stockholders who had previously requested electronic or paper delivery of the proxy materials) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials, including our proxy statement and annual report, on the Internet and how to access a proxy card (or voting instruction card in the case of holders of our Class B common stock) to vote on the Internet or by telephone. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how to request a paper copy of the proxy materials. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you will not receive a paper copy of the proxy materials unless you request one. If you would like to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. We may, at our discretion, voluntarily choose to mail or deliver a paper copy of the proxy materials, including our proxy statement and annual report, to one or more stockholders. 
What items of business will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
At the Annual Meeting, we will consider and act upon the following proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  The election of six Class II Directors to the Board of Directors to serve until our 2021 annual meeting of  stockholders.  
[END TABLE]

  2.  The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as our independent  registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year 2019.

  4.  The approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this  proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  The transaction of such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or  postponement thereof.  
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Holders of Class A common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock as of the record date of October 10, 2018 (the "Record Date") are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. 
Holders of Class B common stock. The Trustee, as the record holder of the Class B common stock on the Record Date, is entitled to vote the Class B common stock at the Annual Meeting and any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. As provided in the VTA, beneficial owners of Class B common stock as of the Record Date are eligible to provide voting instructions to the Trustee with respect to their shares of Class B common stock. Beneficial owners of Class B common stock must provide voting instructions not later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on December 4, 2018 in order to be counted. 
How will the Trustee vote the Class B common stock held in the Class B Voting Trust? 
Based on the instructions of the beneficial owners of the Class B common stock and pursuant to the VTA, the Trustee will vote all of the Class B common stock as a block in the manner determined by the plurality of the votes timely received by the Trustee from such beneficial owners of Class B common stock for the election of directors to serve on our Board of Directors, and by a majority of the votes timely received by the Trustee from such beneficial owners of the Class B common stock for all other matters. In the event that the voting instructions provided by the beneficial owners of the Class B common stock result in a tie, the Trustee shall vote all shares of Class B common stock held in the Class B Voting Trust based upon our written direction. In such case, we intend to instruct the Trustee to vote the shares of Class B common stock in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on each matter as set forth in this proxy statement. 
How does the Board of Directors recommend stockholders vote on the business of the Annual Meeting? 
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote their shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  "FOR" the election of each of the six Class II Director nominees identified in this proxy  statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of EY to serve as our independent registered public  accounting firm for our fiscal year 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  "FOR" the approval of the Amended and Restated 2013 EIP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers,  as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote in accordance with their judgment on such matter. 
How many shares can be voted at the Annual Meeting? 
At the close of business on October 10, 2018, 53,925,158 shares of our Class A common stock and 79,409,403 shares of our Class B common stock were outstanding. Each share of Class A common stock and each share of   Class B common stock is entitled to one vote. The Trustee of the Class B Voting Trust will vote all shares of Class B common stock as a block based on voting instructions from the beneficial owners of the Class B common stock (or pursuant to our written directions, in the event such instructions result in a tie), as described above. 
How many shares must be present or represented at the Annual Meeting to constitute a quorum to conduct business? 
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), the holders of a majority of the voting power of our stock (Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined) issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, constitute a quorum to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will be treated as present for purposes of determining a quorum. Regardless of how the beneficial owners of Class B common stock instruct the Trustee to vote their shares, under the VTA, all of the shares of Class B common stock held in the Class B Voting Trust will be counted as present for the purposes of establishing a quorum. Accordingly, regardless of the number of shares of Class A common stock voted, we expect to have a quorum established for the Annual Meeting. 
What vote is required to approve each of the items of business? 
Item 1—Election of directors. Directors will be elected by the holders of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, voting together as one class, whether present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. 
Item 2—Ratification of independent registered public accounting firm. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, voting together as one class, whether present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, is required to ratify EY as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Item 3—Approval of the Amended and Restated2013 EIP. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, voting together as one class, whether present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, is required to approve the Amended and Restated 2013 EIP. 
Item 4—Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers ("say-on-pay"). Please note that the "say-on-pay" vote is only advisory in nature and has no binding effect on us or our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors will consider Item 4 approved if the votes cast in favor of such proposal exceed the votes cast against such proposal. 
Can Class B holders determine the outcome of the proposals? 
As of the Record Date, our outstanding Class B common stock represented approximately 59.6% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined. Accordingly, sufficient shares of Class B common stock are held in the Class B Voting Trust to determine the outcome of each item under consideration. Although the beneficial owners of our Class B common stock have not indicated how they will instruct the Trustee to vote their shares of Class B common stock, under the VTA, so long as we are a "controlled company" under the NASDAQ stock market ("NASDAQ") rules, beneficial owners of Class B common stock are required to use reasonable efforts to cause (i) the appointment or nomination of directors necessary to constitute the full Board of Directors, (ii) the election of at least three independent directors, including one who is an "audit committee financial expert" under the federal securities laws, and (iii) Premier to be in compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements. In the event that the voting instructions provided by the beneficial owners of the Class B common stock result in a tie, the Trustee shall vote all shares of Class B common stock held in the Class B Voting Trust based upon our written direction. In such case, we intend to   instruct the Trustee to vote the shares of Class B common stock in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on each matter as set forth in this proxy statement. Generally, the VTA will terminate when the holders of our Class B common stock cease to beneficially own in the aggregate at least 20% of our outstanding common stock. 
In addition, according to the records of our transfer agent, as of the Record Date, certain holders of our Class B common stock also beneficially owned 1,968,099 shares of our Class A common stock, representing approximately 3.6% of our outstanding Class A common stock and representing approximately 1.5% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined. 
See "What effect do abstentions and broker non-votes have on the items of business?" for the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes on the required votes above. 
What is the Class B common unit exchange process? Will it impact the Annual Meeting? 
In connection with our reorganization and initial public offering ("IPO"), our member owners were issued Class B common units in Premier LP and an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement entered into as of September 25, 2013, and effective as of October 1, 2013, by and among us, Premier LP and its limited partners (the "Exchange Agreement"), each member owner has the cumulative right, subject to certain restrictions, commencing on October 31, 2014, and during each year thereafter, to exchange up to one-seventh of its initial allocation of Premier LP Class B common units, as well as any additional Premier LP Class B common units purchased by such member owner pursuant to certain rights of first refusal set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on a quarterly basis, for shares of our Class A common stock (on a one-for-one basis), cash or a combination of both, the form of consideration to be at the discretion of the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. For each Premier LP Class B common unit that is exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the member owner will also surrender one corresponding share of Premier Class B common stock, which will automatically be retired. 
As of the Record Date there were 79,409,403 Class B common units of Premier LP outstanding. On October 31, 2018, the next quarterly exchange date under the Exchange Agreement, 48,973,436 Class B common units of Premier LP will be eligible for exchange under the Exchange Agreement. Based on indicated participation in the October 31, 2018 Class B common unit exchange process, as of October 15, 2018, a maximum of 9,833,739 Class B common units will be exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, cash or a combination thereof, as determined by our Audit and Compliance Committee. Correspondingly, we expect an equal number of shares of Class B common stock to be removed from the Class B Voting Trust and retired. On or about October 31, 2018, we expect to file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the final results of the October 31, 2018 exchange process. 
Since the exchange date does not occur until October 31, 2018, which is after the Record Date, any shares of our Class A common stock issued in exchange for Class B common units will not be entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting and, accordingly, will not have any impact on the outcome of the matters presented for approval. Upon retirement of shares of Class B common stock in connection with any Class B common unit exchange, the number of shares of Class B common stock held in the Class B Voting Trust will also be reduced, and, since such shares of Class B common stock will no longer be eligible to be voted by the Trustee, the Trustee will not include those ineligible shares in its determination of the vote to be made on behalf of the holders of Class B common stock at the Annual Meeting. 
As previously noted, as of the Record Date, our outstanding Class B common stock represented approximately 59.6% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined and, thus, can determine the outcome of each item under consideration. Following the completion of the exchange process, assuming we settled the exchange solely with shares of Class A common stock, we expect the Class B common stock to represent approximately 52.2% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined. Assuming we settled the exchange solely with cash, we expect the Class B common stock to represent approximately 56.3% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined.   While we do not currently expect the Class B common unit exchange process to materially impact the Annual Meeting or the matters to be voted upon thereat, in the event that is not the case, we will provide updated soliciting material to our stockholders prior to the Annual Meeting. 
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
Most of our Class A common stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
Stockholder of record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record, and we have made these proxy materials available to you over the Internet or have delivered paper copies of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the meeting. We have enclosed a proxy card for you to use. 
Beneficial owner. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or nominee which is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a signed proxy from the record holder giving you the right to vote the shares. Your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed or provided a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares. If you do not provide the stockholder of record with voting instructions, your shares may constitute broker non-votes. The effect of broker non-votes is more specifically described in "What effect do abstentions and broker non-votes have on the items of business?" below. 
All of the Class B common stockholders are beneficial owners of the Class B common stock held in the Class B Voting Trust. The Trustee is the record holder of all of the shares of Class B common stock. Beneficial owners of Class B common stock will receive a voting instruction card that should be used to provide voting instructions to the Trustee. 
How can I have my shares represented at the Annual Meeting?

The Trustee may vote the Class B common stock in person or by proxy in a manner similar to the holders of our Class A common stock. 
Attending the Meeting 
While we encourage voting in advance by proxy, holders of Class A common stock also have the option of voting their shares in person at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial owners of Class B common stock may only vote their shares in accordance with the terms of the VTA and cannot vote their shares in person at the Annual Meeting (although they are invited and welcome to attend the Annual Meeting in person). 
Shares of Class A common stock held directly in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. Submitting your proxy by telephone, by Internet or by mail will in no way limit your right to vote at the Annual Meeting if you later decide to attend in person. 
Shares of Class A common stock held beneficially in street name may be voted in person by you only if you obtain a signed proxy from the record holder giving you the right to vote the shares. Owners of shares of Class A common stock held in street name that expect to attend and vote at the meeting should contact their broker, bank or nominee as soon as possible to obtain the necessary proxy. 
Please see "How do I gain admission to the Annual Meeting?" below if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person. 
Even if you currently plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.

What effect do abstentions and broker non-votes have on the items of business? 
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. If you are a beneficial owner of Class A common stock, your bank, broker or other nominee holder of record is permitted to vote your shares on the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm even if the record holder does not receive voting instructions from you. Absent instructions from you, the record holder may not vote on any "nondiscretionary" matter, including a director election, an equity compensation plan, a matter relating to executive compensation or any stockholder proposal. In that case, without your voting instructions, a broker non-vote will occur. For all other matters, including the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm, the record holder may vote at its discretion. You should consult your bank, broker or other nominee holder if you have questions about this. As indicated above, our Board of Directors will consider Item 4 ("say-on-pay") approved if the votes cast in favor of such proposal exceed the votes cast against such proposal. Accordingly, broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for or against Item 4. 
An "abstention" will occur at the Annual Meeting if your shares of Class A common stock are deemed to be present at the Annual Meeting, either because you attend the Annual Meeting or because you have properly completed and returned a proxy, but you do not vote on any proposal or other matter which is required to be voted on by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. An abstention on any of the items listed above will have the effect of a vote against that item, except for the election of directors and Item 4 ("say-on-pay"), in each case for which abstentions will not be counted. 
The affirmative vote of at least a majority of our issued and outstanding shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to approve any stockholder proposal validly presented at a meeting of stockholders. Under applicable Delaware law, in determining whether any stockholder proposal has received the requisite number of affirmative votes, abstentions will be counted and will have the same effect as a vote against any stockholder proposal, except for the election of any director nominee. Abstentions will have no effect on a vote to elect a director nominee, and broker non-votes will be ignored for all votes. There are no dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection with any stockholder vote to be taken at the Annual Meeting. 
Shares of Class B common stock will be voted in accordance with the VTA. We do not expect any broker non-votes or abstentions at the Annual Meeting with respect to our Class B common stock.  What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card? 
Most likely, it means (i) your shares of Class A common stock are registered differently or are in more than one account or (ii) you own shares of both Class A and Class B common stock. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy and voting instruction cards you receive. 
How do I gain admission to the Annual Meeting? 
Attendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to Class A and Class B common stockholders as of the Record Date. Registration will begin at 9:15 a.m., Eastern Standard Time. You will need to bring admission ticket and valid picture identification. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the meeting. Additional rules of conduct regarding the meeting may be provided at the meeting. 
To obtain an admission ticket in advance of the meeting, you must send a written request or email along with proof of ownership (such as your brokerage firm account statement, statement of holdings from our transfer agent or Voting Trust Certificate) to Investor Relations, Premier, Inc., 13034 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28277 or annualmeeting@premierinc.com. Please bring photo identification with you for admittance to the meeting. 
Who pays the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? 
We are making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials. If you choose to access the proxy materials or vote over the Internet, however, you are responsible for Internet access charges you may incur. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, if requested, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone or by electronic communication by our directors, officers and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. We will request banks, brokers, nominees, custodians and other fiduciaries who hold shares of our stock in street name to forward these proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of those shares, and we will reimburse the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incur in doing so. At our discretion, we may engage a proxy solicitation firm to assist us with the solicitation process, for which we will bear the costs of any such engagement. We will also reimburse the Trustee for any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the administration of its duties under the VTA in connection with the Annual Meeting. 
Who will count the votes? 
We have retained Broadridge Financial Solutions to tabulate the votes and serve as the independent inspector of election for the Annual Meeting. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We will publish the final results of the voting in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days of the Annual Meeting. 
Can I access the proxy statement and annual report on the Internet? 
Yes. As noted above, we are furnishing our proxy materials to our stockholders via the Internet, except for those stockholders who have elected to receive paper copies. We highly recommend that you receive electronic delivery of Premier, Inc. proxy statements, annual reports and other stockholder communications. This helps reduce the use of paper and reduces our printing, postage and other costs. If you have previously requested paper copies of such materials, you can elect to receive electronic copies when you vote on the Internet. 
This proxy statement, the form of proxy and voting instruction card and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the "2018 Form 10-K") are available at www.proxyvote.com. If you are a   stockholder of record who has requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials and would like to access future Company proxy statements and annual reports electronically instead of receiving paper copies in the mail, there are several ways to do this. You can mark the appropriate box on your proxy card or follow the instructions if you vote by telephone or the Internet. If you choose to access future proxy statements and annual reports on the Internet, you will receive a proxy card in the mail next year with instructions containing the Internet address for those materials. Your choice will remain in effect until you advise us otherwise. If you have Internet access, we hope you make this choice. 
What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
Pursuant to SEC rules, we are permitted to deliver one copy of our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, and our proxy materials for those who have elected paper copies, in a single envelope addressed to all stockholders who share a single address unless they have notified us they wish to "opt out" of the program known as "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders of record who have the same address and last name receive only one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy materials. Householding is intended to reduce our printing and postage costs and material waste. WE WILL DELIVER A SEPARATE COPY OF THE NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS, AND PROXY MATERIALS IF APPLICABLE, PROMPTLY UPON WRITTEN OR ORAL REQUEST. You may request a separate copy by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 13034 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28277, or by calling 1-704-816-4662. 
If you are a beneficial stockholder and you choose not to have the aforementioned disclosure documents sent to a single household address as described above, you must "opt-out" by writing to: Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, or by calling 1-866-540-7095, and we will cease householding all such disclosure documents within 30 days. If we do not receive instructions to remove your account(s) from this service, your account(s) will continue to be householded until we notify you otherwise. If you are a beneficial stockholder and other stockholders with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of the aforementioned disclosure documents, or if you hold stock in more than one account and, in either case, you wish to receive only a single copy of the disclosure documents, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions at the address or phone number above. If you own shares in nominee name (such as through a broker), information regarding householding of disclosure documents should have been forwarded to you by your broker. 
Who should I contact if I have questions? 
If you are a holder of our Class A or Class B common stock through a brokerage account or the Class B Voting Trust, as applicable, and you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, you should contact the broker or bank where you hold the account or the Trustee of the Class B Voting Trust, accordingly. 
If you are a registered holder of our Class A common stock and you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please call our Investor Relations department at 1-704-816-5958.

ITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board is divided into three classes, each containing as nearly as possible an equal number of directors. The current term of office for our Class II Directors expires at the Annual Meeting, while the term for our Class III Directors expires at the 2019 annual meeting and the term for our Class I Directors expires at the 2020 annual meeting. Upon unanimous recommendation by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, the Board proposes that the following nominees be elected for new terms of three years and until their successors are duly elected and qualified as Class II Directors: Barclay E. Berdan, William E. Mayer, Scott Reiner, Terry D. Shaw, Richard J. Statuto and Ellen C. Wolf. Each nominee has consented to serve if elected, and each nominee is currently a member of our Board of Directors.    If any of them becomes unavailable to serve as a director, the Board may designate a substitute nominee. In that case, the persons named as proxy holders will vote for the substitute nominee designated by the Board. 
Director Qualifications and Biographies 
The Nominating and Governance Committee, consistent with the desires of the full Board, seeks to achieve a Board that represents a diverse mix of skills, perspectives, talents, backgrounds and education that will enhance our decision-making process, oversee management's execution of strategic objectives and represent the interests of all of our stockholders. Key factors considered in connection with the selection of director nominees are independence, critical thinking skills, practical wisdom and mature judgment in the decision-making process. Our Board composition reflects our commitment to include individuals from diverse backgrounds and with diverse experience, and the members of our Nominating and Governance Committee are mindful of that objective when they nominate directors for election. Our Board composition also reflects the Nominating and Governance Committee's determination as to the appropriate size of the Board to facilitate effective communication and cooperation. 
Important information about our corporate governance practices, the responsibilities and functioning of the Board and its committees, director compensation and related party transactions is found elsewhere in this proxy statement. We encourage you to review this information in connection with your decisions on the election of the director nominees. 
The information set forth below includes, with respect to each nominee and each continuing director, his or her age as of the Record Date, principal occupation and employment during the past five years, the year in which he or she first became one of our directors, and other public company directorships held by such person during the last five years. Further, the independence status of each nominee and each continuing director, as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with the standards set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the listing standards of NASDAQ, is provided below. A director or director nominee designated below as a "member-director" is a director employed by a Premier stockholder hospital or health system or by a group affiliate or other non-provider organization affiliated with one or more Premier member facilities participating in our group purchasing program, which we refer to as our "member owners," and, because of such relationship, is not deemed to be independent. Each of our directors also serves on the board of managers of Premier Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Premier and the general partner of Premier LP.  In addition to the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each nominee and continuing director outlined below, which have led the Board to conclude that such person should serve as a member of the Board, our Board believes that each nominee and each continuing director has demonstrated broad-based business knowledge, outstanding achievement in his or her professional career, commitment to ethical and moral values, personal and professional integrity, sound business judgment and a commitment to corporate citizenship.

Committee Membership: Compensation Committee 
There are no family relationships between any of our executive officers, directors and director nominees. The business address of each of our directors and director nominees is 13034 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, NC 28277  ITEM 2 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
In accordance with its charter, the Audit and Compliance Committee selected the firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to be our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year 2019 audit period and, with the endorsement of the Board of Directors, recommends to our stockholders that they ratify that appointment. The Audit and Compliance Committee will reconsider the appointment of EY for the next audit period if such appointment is not ratified. Representatives of EY are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Audit and Compliance Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, both in fact and appearance. Consistent with its charter, the Audit and Compliance Committee has evaluated EY's qualifications, performance and independence, including that of the lead audit partner. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and approves, in advance, the audit scope, the types of non-audit services, if any, and the estimated fees for each category for the coming year. For each category of proposed service, EY is required to confirm that the provision of such services does not impair its independence. Before selecting EY, the Audit and Compliance Committee carefully considered that firm's qualifications as an independent registered public accounting firm. This included a review of its performance in prior years, as well as its reputation for integrity and competence in the fields of accounting and auditing. The Audit and Compliance Committee has expressed its satisfaction with EY in all of these respects. The Audit and Compliance Committee's review included inquiry concerning any litigation involving EY and any proceedings by the SEC against the firm, if any. In this respect, the Audit and Compliance Committee has concluded that the ability of EY to perform services for Premier is in no way adversely affected by any such investigation or litigation. 
Audit and Compliance Committee Pre-Approval of Accounting Services 
The Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for the appointment, oversight and evaluation of our independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with our Audit and Compliance Committee's charter, our Audit and Compliance Committee must approve, in advance of the service, all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Our independent registered public accounting firm may not be retained to perform the non-audit services specified in Section 10A(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Audit and Compliance Committee has concluded that provision of the non-audit services described in that section is not compatible with maintaining the independence of EY. 
The Audit and Compliance Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm, as well as all engagement fees and terms for our independent registered public accounting firm. Under the policy, the Audit and Compliance Committee must approve the services to be rendered and fees to be charged by our independent registered public accounting firm. Typically, the Audit and Compliance Committee approves services up to a specific amount of fees. The Audit and Compliance Committee must then approve, in advance, any services or fees exceeding those pre-approved levels, subject to the de minimis exception set forth in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act. The Audit and Compliance Committee may delegate general pre-approval authority to a subcommittee of which the chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee is a member. All requests or applications for services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm must be submitted to specified officers who may determine whether such services are included within the list of pre-approved services. All requests for services that have not been pre-approved must be accompanied by a statement that the request is consistent with the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from Premier.

PREMIER, INC. 2013 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON 
STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE PLAN 
Overview 
We currently maintain the Premier, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective December 1, 2017 (which we refer to in this Proposal as the "Current Plan"), for the benefit of our eligible employees, non-employee directors and certain other service providers. The Current Plan was originally adopted and approved by our stockholders prior to our IPO in October 2013 and was most recently amended on December 1, 2017 after approval by our stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
We are asking stockholders to approve an amended and restated version of the Premier, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (which we refer to in this Proposal as the "Amended Plan"). The purpose of this proposal is to increase the shares available for grant and to make certain other amendments that we believe are beneficial, including changes in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") enacted on December 22, 2017. The Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved on September 25, 2018, the Amended Plan, subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting. If this proposal is approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the Amended Plan will become effective on December 7, 2018. We are not extending the term of the Current Plan, and no award will be granted under the Amended Plan on or after September 24, 2023. 
The Board of Directors believes that approving the Amended Plan is in the best interests of stockholders and Premier because equity awards granted under the Plan help to attract, motivate and retain key talent, align employee and stockholder interests, link employee compensation to our performance and maintain a culture based on employee stock ownership. The Current Plan is our only plan for providing equity incentive compensation to our employees. If the Amended Plan is not approved by stockholders, then the Current Plan will remain in place and there will be no increase to the share reserve. Equity is a significant component of total compensation for many of our key employees. 
The text of the Amended Plan, in the form in which it would become effective upon approval of this proposal by stockholders, appears at the end of this proxy statement as Appendix A and is marked to reflect changes from the Current Plan. The following description of the Amended Plan should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Amended Plan. 
Proposed Amendments to the Current Plan and Our Rationale 
Increasing the Number of Shares Reserved for Issuance 
The Current Plan sets forth a maximum number of shares authorized for issuance. The Board is requesting that stockholders approve the addition of 3,500,000shares of Class A common stock to the share reserve under the Amended Plan. As of September 30, 2018, 3,046,831 shares remained authorized but unissued under the Current Plan. As a result, if this proposal is approved, a total of 6,546,831 shares will be available for issuance under the Amended Plan as of that date. Shares of our Class A common stock may be used to issue any type of award permitted under the Amended Plan. If the requisite stockholder approval is not obtained, the Amended Plan will not take effect. In such event, only 3,046,831 shares will remain authorized for issuance under the Current Plan (of the original 11,260,783 shares authorized) and equity awards may continue to be granted under the Current Plan up to this limit. 
Additional Amendments 
In addition to the proposed share increase, the Amended Plan includes the following additional amendments: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An Adjustment to our Minimum Vesting Requirement. The Current Plan includes a vesting limit that  applied to all full value awards and prevented awards granted to employees, other than stock  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), from vesting any more rapidly than pro rata annually over a three-year period. The Amended Plan clarifies that no award may vest  before the first anniversary of the grant date. The Amended Plan also extends the minimum three-year pro rata vesting requirement to all employee awards (including stock options, stock appreciation rights and full value awards).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Explicit Prohibition of Payment of Dividends. The Amended Plan prohibits the payment of dividends and  dividend equivalents on restricted stock units prior to vesting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TCJA Related Amendments. The Amended Plan includes provisions protecting against an inadvertent loss of  grandfathering of existing awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" and allowing new equity-based performance awards going forward, subject to annual limits.  
[END TABLE]
Burn Rate 
We believe that our burn rate is reasonable in light of company growth, changes in our business and number of outstanding shares, and ensures our long-term incentive program is externally competitive, motivational and retentive. The following table sets forth information regarding equity awards granted and earned under the Current Plan, the burn rate for each of the last three fiscal years and the average burn rate over the last three years. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Dilution and Overhang 
We manage our long-term stockholder dilution when granting equity awards annually. Overhang is defined as equity awards outstanding but not exercised or earned, plus equity awards available to be granted ("available equity award shares"), divided by total outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, plus the available equity award shares under the Current Plan. As of September 30, 2018, approximately 5,424,344 shares are outstanding but not exercised or earned under the Plan, plus an additional 3,046,831 are available to be granted. If the Amended Plan is approved, an additional 3,500,000 shares would be available for grant under the Plan. Our overhang, if the Amended Plan is approved, as of September 30, 2018, would be 8.2%.  Plan Totals as of September 30, 2018

See "Description of Executive Compensation Program Elements—Our Equity Plan—2018 Actions" below for details of our grants to named executive officers for fiscal year 2018. 
Summary of the Amended Plan 
Purpose 
The Amended Plan is intended to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants who will provide services to us, our subsidiaries and our affiliates and to provide such persons with incentives consistent with the long-term success of our business. To accomplish these purposes, the Amended Plan provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share awards, performance units, other equity-based awards and cash-based awards. 
Administration 
The Amended Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Our Compensation Committee determines who receives awards under the Amended Plan, the number of shares of our Class A common stock, share units and/or dollars covered by such awards and the terms and conditions of each award, subject to the minimum vesting restrictions described above. Within the terms of the Amended Plan, our Compensation Committee may accelerate the vesting of any award and modify, cancel or substitute any awards. In addition, our Compensation Committee interprets the Amended Plan and may adopt any administrative rules, regulations, procedures and guidelines governing the Amended Plan or any awards granted under the Amended   Plan as it deems to be appropriate. Our Compensation Committee may delegate to any subcommittee of our Board of Directors the authority to make awards or to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to make awards to employees who are not executive officers. 
Available Shares 
At the time we established the Current Plan in 2013, we reserved 11,260,783 shares of our Class A common stock for issuance. If this Item 3 proposal is approved by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the total number of shares of our Class A common stock available under the Amended Plan will be 14,760,783 shares. As of September 30, 2018, there were approximately 3,046,831 shares available for issuance under the Current Plan. If approved, there would have been approximately 6,546,831 shares available for issuance under the Amended Plan, as of September 30, 2018. These shares may be shares of original issuance, shares held in treasury or shares that have been reacquired by us. The number of our shares of Class A common stock authorized for grant under the Amended Plan is subject to adjustment, as described below. Awards that are to be settled by issuing shares are only counted against the number of shares available under the Amended Plan to the extent shares are actually issued under those awards. Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations or tendered to pay the exercise price of an option under the Amended Plan and shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an option exercise shall again be available for grant under the Plan. 
Non-Employee Director Compensation 
The aggregate value of equity awards granted to, and cash compensation earned by, any individual non-employee director during any calendar year may not exceed $500,000. The value of equity granted to a non-employee director is determined as of the grant date. With respect to stock options and stock appreciation rights, the equity value is determined based on the pricing model we use to report our financial results and assumptions set forth in our SEC filings. With respect to other equity awards, the equity value is the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock as of the grant date. See "Fiscal Year 2018 Director Compensation Table" under "—Compensation of Directors" below for further information regarding our director compensation practices during fiscal year 2018. 
Eligibility for Participation; Minimum Vesting and Performance Cycle 
Our Compensation Committee may grant awards to employees and consultants; provided, however, only employees shall be eligible to receive incentive stock options ("ISOs"). Our Board of Directors may also grant awards to non-employee directors. As of September 30, 2018, approximately 350 employees and 15 non-employee directors were eligible to receive awards under the Amended Plan. Under the Amended Plan, the minimum vesting requirement generally prohibits the vesting of any awards before the first anniversary of their grant. In addition, for employee awards, the Amended Plan generally prohibits (i) vesting more rapidly than pro rata over a three-year period and (ii) performance cycles of less than one year. 
Award Agreement 
Awards granted under the Amended Plan will be evidenced by award agreements, which need not be identical, that provide additional terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations covering the grant of the award, including, without limitation, additional terms providing for the acceleration of exercisability or vesting of awards in the event of a change of control or conditions regarding the participant's employment, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. 
Nonqualified Stock Options 
An award of a nonqualified stock option grants a participant the right to purchase a certain number of shares of our Class A common stock during a specified term in the future, after a vesting period, at an exercise price equal   to at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock on the grant date. The term of a nonqualified stock option may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. The exercise price may be paid, in the Compensation Committee's sole discretion, with cash or check, shares of our Class A common stock already owned by the participant, a reduction in shares issuable upon exercise which have a value equal to the exercise price, (to the extent permitted by law) with proceeds from a sale of shares from broker-assisted cashless exercise, any other consideration deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee or any combination of the foregoing, in each case as permitted by the Compensation Committee. A nonqualified stock option is an option that does not meet the qualifications of an ISO, as provided in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") and summarized in part below. 
Incentive Stock Options 
An ISO is a stock option that meets the requirements of Section 422 of the Code, which generally include that the option have an exercise price of no less than 100% of fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock on the grant date, have a term of no more than 10 years and be granted from a plan that has been approved by stockholders. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
A SAR entitles the participant to receive a percentage (up to 100%) of the difference between the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the exercise date and the exercise price of the SAR, multiplied by the number of shares subject to the SAR. Payment to a participant upon the exercise of a SAR may be in cash or shares of our Class A common stock, as designated by the Compensation Committee. No SAR may be exercised more than 10 years from the date of grant. 
Restricted Stock 
A restricted stock award is an award of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock that does not vest until after a specified period of time, or satisfaction of other vesting conditions as determined by our Compensation Committee, and which may be forfeited if conditions to vesting are not met. Participants are generally entitled to vote the shares underlying their awards, but will not be entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents under the Amended Plan prior to vesting. 
Restricted Stock Units 
A restricted stock unit is an award denominated and settled in shares of our Class A common stock, subject to terms and conditions determined by our Compensation Committee. Participants do not have voting rights, but our Compensation Committee may authorize the award of dividend equivalents that accumulate until the vesting of the award. 
Other Stock-Based Awards 
The Amended Plan provides our Compensation Committee the discretion to grant other awards payable in shares of our Class A common stock, such as deferred stock units and unrestricted shares. In the event of such an award, the Compensation Committee would determine the terms and conditions of such award, including any vesting criteria applicable thereto. 
Cash-Based Awards 
A cash-based award is a cash-denominated award which the Compensation Committee may grant to participants, subject to conditions determined by the Compensation Committee, which conditions may include the achievement of individual or company performance objectives. Each cash-based award will specify a payment   amount, formula or payment ranges as determined by the Compensation Committee. Payment with respect to any cash-based award shall be made in cash. The Compensation Committee may grant cash-based awards to some or all employees in addition to awards under the Amended Plan. 
Performance Share Awards 
The Amended Plan authorizes our Compensation Committee to grant performance share awards, which may be payable in shares, share units or cash. We intend to continue to grant performance share awards. Performance share awards vest and become payable upon the achievement of performance objectives within a period of time specified by our Compensation Committee. Performance share awards may be subject to the achievement of specified performance objectives. Performance objectives may be described in terms of company-wide objectives or objectives that are related to the performance of the individual participant or a subsidiary, division, department or function within our company or a subsidiary of ours in which the participant is employed. Performance objectives may be measured on an absolute or relative basis, and relative performance may be measured by a group of peer companies or by a financial market index. The Amended Plan generally provides the Compensation Committee discretion to modify performance goals as it deems appropriate or increase or decrease the amount payable at a given level of performance. 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and Grandfathered Awards 
The TCJA expands the number of individuals covered by Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)") and eliminates the Section 162(m) "performance-based compensation" exception for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, except for otherwise qualified compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not subsequently materially modified (collectively, "Grandfathered Awards"). While the Compensation Committee currently intends that Grandfathered Awards will be administered consistent with being exempt from the $1 million compensation limitation, no assurance can be given as to whether awards that are intended to qualify for the Section 162(m) performance-based compensation exception under the Current Plan will be deductible under the applicable transition relief guidance. See "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Deductions" below for a more detailed discussion of the TCJA as it relates to Section 162(m). In any event, the Compensation Committee retains full discretion to grant non-deductible awards under the Amended Plan. 
Annual Limits 
The annual limits in the Current Plan will continue to apply under the Amended Plan. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock with respect to which any stock option or SAR may be granted under the Amended Plan during any calendar year is 500,000. The maximum number of shares subject to full value awards (awards other than stock options and SARs) granted to any eligible individual during any calendar year is 500,000, or if the full value award is paid in cash, other securities or other property, no more than the value of 500,000 shares (calculated on the last day of the performance cycle to which the award relates). The maximum value of a cash payment made under a performance award granted during a calendar year is $3,000,000 if the performance cycle is 12 months and $6,000,000 if the performance cycle is more than 12 months. 
Change in Control 
Except as otherwise provided in an award agreement, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Amended Plan), the Compensation Committee may, but will not be obligated to, (i) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to all or any portion of an award; (ii) cancel awards for a cash payment equal to their fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee), which, in the case of options and SARs, will be deemed to be equal to the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration to be paid in the Change in Control transaction to holders of the same number of shares subject to such options or SARs (or, if no consideration is paid in any such transaction, the fair market value of the shares subject to such options or   SARs) over the aggregate strike price; (iii) provide for the issuance of substitute awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected awards previously granted under the Amended Plan as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion; (iv) terminate options without providing accelerated vesting or (v) take any other action with respect to awards that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The treatment of awards upon a Change in Control may vary among participants in the Compensation Committee's sole discretion. With respect to existing awards under the Current Plan, performance awards will be settled upon a Change in Control as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion based upon the extent to which the performance goals for any such awards have been achieved after evaluating actual performance over the course of the performance cycle until the date of the Change in Control and the anticipated level of performance as of the date of the Change in Control. 
Repricing 
The terms of a stock option or SAR cannot be amended to lower the exercise price, and options and SARs may not be cancelled in exchange for cash, other awards or stock options and SARs with an exercise price lower than the exercise price of the cancelled stock options or SARs without, in each case, stockholder approval. 
Recoupment and Clawback 
All awards granted under the Amended Plan are subject to any compensation recovery policy, and all awards (and any proceeds) are subject to any clawback policy we may implement, including any policy implemented to comply with legal requirements such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). 
Amendment and Termination 
The Amended Plan may be amended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time, but no amendment may be made without stockholder approval if it would increase the number of shares issued or available under the Amended Plan, materially expand benefits accruing to plan participants, reduce the minimum exercise price of an option or base price of an SAR granted under the Amended Plan, modify the eligibility criteria for participation in the Amended Plan, increase per-person limits or the number of shares which may be issued, delete or limit the prohibition against repricing or otherwise require approval by stockholders in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of a national stock exchange on which the shares subject to the Amended Plan are listed. Unless required to comply with applicable laws, no termination, suspension or amendment of the Amended Plan may adversely affect the rights of any participant with respect to a previously granted award without the participant's written consent. 
Transferability 
Awards granted under the Amended Plan are generally nontransferable (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution), except that the Committee may provide for the transferability of nonqualified stock options at the time of grant or thereafter to certain family members. 
Effective Date and Term 
If approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the Amended Plan will be effective as of December 7, 2018. No award will be granted under the Amended Plan on or after September 24, 2023. 
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
Federal Income Tax Consequences of Equity Incentive Plan Awards 
The following is a brief summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of transactions under the Amended Plan, based on current U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive,   does not constitute tax advice and, among other things, does not describe state, local or foreign tax consequences, which may be substantially different. 
Nonqualified Stock Options. Generally, a participant will not recognize taxable income on the grant or vesting of a nonqualified stock option. Upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of our Class A common stock received on the date of exercise and the option cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the exercise price per share). 
Incentive Stock Options. No taxable income is recognized by a participant on the grant or vesting of an ISO. If a participant exercises an ISO in accordance with its terms and does not dispose of the shares acquired within two years after the date of the grant of the ISO or within one year after the date of exercise, the participant will not, upon exercise, recognize ordinary income or capital gain or loss; however, the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price of the shares acquired is an item of adjustment in computing alternative minimum tax of the participant. If a participant holds the shares acquired for at least one year from the exercise date and does not sell or otherwise dispose of the shares for at least two years from the grant date, the participant's gain or loss upon a subsequent sale will be long-term capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the participant's basis in the shares acquired.  
If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the shares acquired without satisfying the required minimum holding period, such "disqualifying disposition" will give rise to ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired on the exercise date or, if less, the amount realized upon the disqualifying disposition over the participant's tax basis in the shares acquired. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. Generally, a participant will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of an SAR, but will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of an SAR in an amount equal to the cash amount received upon exercise (if the SAR is cash-settled) or the difference between the fair market value of our Class A common stock received from the exercise of the SAR and the amount, if any, paid by the participant in connection with the exercise of the SAR. The participant will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of an SAR regardless of whether the shares of our Class A common stock acquired upon the exercise of the SAR are subject to further restrictions on sale or transferability. The participant's basis in the shares will be equal to the ordinary income attributable to the exercise. The participant's holding period for shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an SAR begins on the exercise date. 
Restricted Shares. A participant generally will not be taxed at the time of a restricted stock award but will recognize taxable income when the award vests or otherwise is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The amount of taxable income will be the fair market value of the shares at the time of vesting. Participants may elect to be taxed at the time of grant by making an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days of the award date. If a restricted stock award subject to the Section 83(b) election is subsequently canceled, no deduction will be allowed for the amount previously recognized as income, and no tax previously paid will be refunded. Unless a participant makes a Section 83(b) election, dividends paid to a participant on shares of an unvested restricted stock award will be taxable to the participant as ordinary income in compensation for services. If the participant makes a Section 83(b) election, the dividends will be taxable to the participant as dividend income. 
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Awards. A participant generally will not be subject to income tax at the time of grant or vesting of a restricted stock unit award or performance share award, but will recognize taxable income upon receiving stock under the award and cash that is attributable to dividend equivalents, if any. Restricted stock units and performance share awards are subject to Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax upon vesting. The amount of taxable income will be the fair market value of the shares at the time of issuance. No Section 83(b) election is available for restricted stock units or performance share awards.   Other Equity-Based Awards. A participant will generally not recognize taxable income on a deferred stock award until shares subject to the award are distributed. A participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of our Class A common stock on the date of distribution. Any dividend equivalents paid on unvested deferred stock awards are taxable as ordinary income when paid to the participant. A participant will generally recognize taxable income on the grant of unrestricted stock, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the grant date. Except as limited by Section 162(m) (as further discussed below), we will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amounts as the ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
Cash Awards. A participant will generally recognize taxable income upon the payment of a cash award, in an amount equal to the amount of the cash received. Except as limited by Section 162(m) (as further discussed below), we will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amounts as the ordinary income recognized by the participant.  
Withholding. To the extent required by law, we will withhold from any amount paid in settlement of an award such amounts of withholding and other taxes due or take other action as we deem advisable to enable ourselves to satisfy withholding and tax obligations related to any awards.  
Deductions 
We will ordinarily be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by a participant in the Amended Plan (including on the exercise of a stock option or SAR or on delivery pursuant to a restricted stock unit). In the case of restricted shares, unless a participant has made a Section 83(b) election, we will also be entitled to a deduction, for federal income tax purposes, for dividends paid on unvested restricted stock awards. We will also be entitled to a deduction, for federal income tax purposes, for cash dividend equivalent payments on restricted stock units. 
Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, Section 162(m) generally limited to $1 million the federal tax deductibility of some forms of compensation paid in one year to the chief executive officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers employed by the Company at the end of the year (other than the Company's chief financial officer) and provided that "performance-based compensation" may qualify for an exception to the limit on deductibility, if, among other requirements, the plan under which such compensation is paid met certain requirements, including stockholder approval. The Current Plan was originally designed to permit awards that would comply with the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m). As a result of the TCJA, significant changes were made to Section 162(m), including expanding the number of individuals covered by Section 162(m) and eliminating the performance-based compensation exception, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. However, the TCJA also includes transition relief, pursuant to which these changes to Section 162(m) will not apply to compensation payable under a written binding agreement that was in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not subsequently materially modified, and which compensation otherwise would have been deductible under Section 162(m) prior to the effective time of the Act. In August 2018, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") issued initial guidance regarding its interpretation of the transition relief, and the Compensation Committee is considering the impact of this guidance with respect to awards granted on or before November 2, 2017. 
New Plan Benefits; Future Plan Awards 
The value, number of units and type of equity to be awarded in the future under the Amended Plan depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our performance, our goals and objectives, individual performance and the discretion of the Committee. The benefits or amounts that will be received by or allocated to our executive officers or other eligible employees or non-employee directors cannot be determined at this time. Nevertheless, for illustrative purposes and not necessarily indicative of the equity that might be awarded under Amended Plan, the table below sets forth the awards that were granted under the Current Plan during the fiscal   year ended June 30, 2018 to the current named executive officers, all executive officers as a group, all non-employee directors as a group and all other non-executive employees as a group:

Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the Amended and Restated Premier, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. 
In accordance with the Board's recommendation, the proxy holders will vote the shares of Class A common stock covered by valid and timely received proxies "FOR" the approval of the Amended and Restated Premier, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. The Trustee will vote all of the Class B common stock as a block in the matter determined by the majority of the votes timely received by the Trustee.   ITEM 4 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and related SEC rules, we request stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, our executive compensation program. We ask that you support the compensation of our named executive officers, or NEOs, as disclosed under the heading "Executive Compensation," including the "Executive Summary" section, beginning on page 64, and the accompanying tables and related narrative disclosure. This proposal, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the NEOs' compensation as required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. 
Our executives—including our NEOs—are critical to our success. That is why we design our executive compensation program to attract, retain and motivate exceptional and diverse executive talent. We structure our executive compensation program to focus on stockholders' interests by incentivizing superior sustainable long-term performance. We believe our executive compensation program strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our NEOs to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our stockholders. 
Under our executive compensation program, we align pay and performance by making a significant portion of our NEOs' compensation contingent on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• achieving specific and challenging annual and long-term performance goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• increasing stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
As further described in our "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" section, we incorporate rigorous compensation-related design and governance practices to protect our stockholders' interests, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have strong stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers that promote alignment of their interests  with those of our stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our long-term incentive plan is 100% equity-based;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 85% of our CEO's target total compensation is at-risk,  incentive-based pay (67% of which is based on our long-term performance);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• on average, 75% of our other NEOs' target total compensation is  at-risk, incentive-based pay (55% of which is based on long-term performance);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we do not pay tax gross-ups associated with benefits payable in  connection with a change in control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we mitigate risk by limiting incentive payments using multiple performance measures in our incentive plans and  imposing a strong incentive compensation recoupment (clawback) policy; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we prohibit hedging, pledging and short sales of our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
We encourage you to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement, which includes a recap of what we do and what we don't do on page 66, and the "Executive Compensation Tables" beginning on page 84 of this proxy statement to better understand the details of our NEOs' compensation for fiscal year 2018 and their opportunities to realize compensation in the future. 
Our Compensation Committee and our Board believe that our executive compensation program for our NEOs serves our stockholders' interests. The vote on this resolution, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" resolution, is not intended to address any specific element of compensation but rather the overall NEO compensation program as described in this proxy statement. Although this vote is advisory and not binding on us, the Board, and the   Compensation Committee, which is responsible for developing and administering our executive compensation philosophy and program, will consider the results as part of its ongoing review of our executive compensation program. 
The Board recommends that stockholders indicate their support for our compensation of our NEOs, and we ask you to vote "FOR" the following resolution at our Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that Premier's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to Premier's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 and the other related tables and discussion." 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. 
In accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendation, the proxy holders will vote the shares of Class A common stock covered by valid and timely received proxies "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, unless instructed otherwise. The Trustee will vote all of the Class B common stock as a block in the manner determined by the majority of the votes timely received by the Trustee.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD STRUCTURE

Our Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing management of our risks. We have identified five primary areas of enterprise risk across our operations that are monitored and managed by our Board of Directors, management and internal auditors. These areas include risks associated with strategic, operational, financial, legal and information technology and systems, including cybersecurity. In conjunction with its management of these specific risk areas, our Board of Directors manages reputational risks across all of our operations. Our Board of Directors is primarily responsible for oversight of the strategic, operational and information technology and systems risks that we may encounter. The committees of our Board of Directors assist our full Board in risk oversight by addressing specific matters within the purview of each committee. Our Audit and Compliance Committee focuses on oversight of financial, legal and regulatory compliance, as well as ethical risks. The Audit and Compliance Committee oversees the cyber risk management program developed by our President of Performance Services (formerly serving as our Chief Information Officer) and designed to monitor, mitigate and respond to cyber risks, threats and incidents and reviews periodic reports from our President of Performance Services, including developments in cyber threat environment and cyber risk mitigation efforts. Our Finance Committee oversees financial risks related to capital allocation and financial forecasting. Our Compensation Committee, as discussed in more detail below, focuses on risks relating to executive compensation plans and arrangements, and our Nominating and Governance Committee focuses on reputational and corporate governance risks relating to our company including the independence of our Board of Directors. 
While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, our full Board of Directors remains regularly informed regarding such risks through committee reports and otherwise. In addition, our Board and its committees receive regular reports from our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and other members of senior management regarding areas of significant risk to us, including strategic, operational, financial, legal and regulatory, information technology and systems, cyber and reputational risks. We believe the leadership structure of our Board of Directors supports and promotes effective risk management and oversight. 
The Compensation Committee reviews and considers our compensation policies and programs in light of the Board of Directors' risk assessment and management responsibilities on an annual basis. Our human resources department in consultation with Mercer (US) Inc. ("Mercer") prepared and presented to the Compensation Committee a risk assessment report that addressed the incentive compensation structure, plans and processes at all levels of our Company. The assessment included, among other things, a review of pay mix (fixed versus variable, cash versus equity and short-versus long-term), performance metrics, target setting, performance measurement practices, pay determination, mitigation practices such as our compensation recoupment policy, and overall governance and administration of pay programs. After reviewing this report and making inquiries of management, the Compensation Committee determined we have no compensation policies and programs that give rise to risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.

CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA 28277 
ATTENTION: [Addressee*] 
C/O ANNA-MARIE FORREST, CORPORATE SECRETARY

Board Structure and Director Nominations 
Board Structure and Meetings 
The Board's overarching responsibility is to advise and oversee the management and conduct of our business by our Chief Executive Officer and other members of management charged with the health and overall success of Premier's business. To that end, our business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors. Our Board size may not exceed 18 directors, and our Board is currently comprised of 16 members, five of whom are independent under the standards discussed below, 10 of whom are member-directors as discussed below and one of whom is our Chief Executive Officer, Ms. DeVore. The Board is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II and Class III) with staggered terms of three years each. The term of one class expires at each annual meeting of stockholders; thus, directors typically stand for election after three years, unless they are filling an unexpired term. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, no director may serve for more than two full three-year consecutive terms except for (i) the Chief Executive Officer; (ii) each director who is not a director, officer, employee or agent of, or otherwise affiliated with, any stockholder of ours and (iii) a Director serving as Chair of the Board, whose term may be extended at the discretion of the Board. 
Our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Chair of the Board shall not be one of our officers. We believe that having a non-executive Chair of our Board creates an environment that is more conducive to objective evaluation and oversight of management's performance, increasing management accountability and improving the ability of the Board of Directors to monitor whether management's actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Our Chief Executive Officer, Board Chair and Board Vice-Chair work together to set the Board agenda. Board members are invited to make agenda suggestions, and the Board approves the annual schedule of Board and committee items. The Board Chair presides over Board meetings, coordinates the work of the committees of our Board of Directors and performs other duties delegated to the Chair by our Board of Directors. Committee assignments and designation of the committee chair are made by the Board based upon recommendations of the Board Chair and Nominating and Governance Committee. Executive sessions of independent directors, held outside the presence of employee Board members and member-directors, are scheduled at each in-person Board meeting and may be called at any other Board or committee meeting. The Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee presides over executive sessions. 
The Board of Directors adopted the foregoing structure to promote decision-making and governance independent of that of our management and to better perform the Board's monitoring and evaluation functions. Members of our Board of Directors are kept informed of our business through discussions with our Chief Executive Officer and other officers, by reviewing materials provided to them, by visiting our offices and by participating in meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees. 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board members are expected to prepare for and attend at least 75% of all Board and applicable committee meetings. The Board of Directors met nine times during fiscal year 2018. In addition, the independent directors met in executive session four times during fiscal year 2018. Except for Marvin O'Quinn, each incumbent member of the Board of Directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board of Directors and of the committees on which he or she served that were held during the period for which he or she was a director or committee member, respectively. In addition, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are encouraged to attend each annual meeting of stockholders. All directors who were   serving as directors at the time of our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 1, 2017 attended such annual meeting. We expect all of our directors to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Criteria for Board Members 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide criteria applicable to both the composition of the Board as a whole and individual directors.

The Board recognizes that criteria change as the membership of the Board changes and considers the current make-up and requirements of the Board in its nomination process. To be considered for Board membership, individual directors should possess the following personal traits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

• geography;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• level of engagement with us; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• candidate's gender, ethnic background and age.  
[END TABLE]
Board Diversity 
Although there is no formal policy on diversity of nominees, both the Board of Directors and the Nominating and Governance Committee believe that diversity of skills, perspectives and experiences as represented on the Board as a whole, in addition to the primary factors, attributes or qualities discussed above, promote improved monitoring and evaluation of management on behalf of the stockholders and produce more creative thinking and solutions. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers, but does not base its choices solely on, the distinctive skills, perspectives and experiences that candidates diverse in gender, ethnic background, geographic origin and professional experience offer. In addition, under our Board Competency and Succession Plan Policy, the Board seeks to have a composition diverse in gender, ethnicity and age. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not explicitly provide limitations on Board service due to age. 
Resignation Policy; Vacancies 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our non-management directors must submit a letter of resignation upon resignation or retirement from, or termination of, the director's principal current employment, or other similarly material changes in professional occupation or association. The Board is free to accept or reject the letter of resignation based on the best interests of the Board and stockholders and shall promptly notify such director of its decision. 
A director appointed by the Board to fill a vacancy, including a vacancy created by a resignation, will serve until the next election of the class for which such director has been appointed and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. 
Director Nomination Process 
The Nominating and Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chair of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for identifying, considering, recommending, recruiting and selecting, or recommending that the Board select, candidates to fill open positions on the Board consistent with Board-approved criteria and qualifications for membership. It is the Board's expectation that all Board members participate in Board recruitment efforts. 
Internal Process for Identifying Candidates 
The Board Competency and Succession Plan Policy is the guideline for the Nominating and Governance Committee in evaluating and nominating Board candidates. The Nominating and Governance Committee has two primary methods for identifying director nominees (other than those proposed by stockholders, as discussed   below). First, on a periodic basis, the Committee solicits ideas for possible candidates from members of the Board of Directors, senior level executives and other individuals personally known to the members of the Board. Second, the Committee may from time to time use its authority under its charter to retain, at our expense, one or more search firms to identify candidates (and to approve such firms' fees and other retention terms). 
Proposals for Director Nominees by Stockholders 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider written proposals from stockholders for director nominees that are timely and properly noticed. In considering candidates submitted by stockholders, the Nominating and Governance Committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board of Directors and the qualifications of the candidate. In accordance with Article I, Section 12 of our Bylaws, to be timely, stockholder notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 70 days, from such anniversary, proposed nominee(s) and related notice, in order to be timely, must be received not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. The Nominating and Governance Committee received no nominee recommendations from stockholders for the Annual Meeting. Stockholder nominations for our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders must be received at our principal executive offices on or after August 9, 2019 and not later than September 8, 2019. A stockholder's notice must be in the form set forth in Article I, Section 12 of our Bylaws and must be addressed to Premier, Inc., 13034 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
Article I, Section 12 of our Bylaws requires, among other things, that the notice must set forth: 
(1) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; 
(2) the name and record address of the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made; 
(3) the class and number of shares of our stock which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; 
(4) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination; 
(5) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends to (i) deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of our outstanding capital stock required to elect the nominee and/or (ii) solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such nominee; 
(6) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; 
(7) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination and/or the voting of shares of any class or series of our stock between or among the stockholder giving the notice, the   beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made, any of their respective affiliates or associates and/or any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing (collectively, "proponent persons"); and 
(8) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including without limitation any contract to purchase or sell, acquisition or grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell, swap or other instrument) the intent or effect of which may be (i) to transfer to or from any proponent person, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security of ours; (ii) to increase or decrease the voting power of any proponent person with respect to shares of any class or series of our stock and/or (iii) to provide any proponent person, directly or indirectly, with the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from, or to otherwise benefit economically from, any increase or decrease in the value of any security of ours. 
A stockholder proposing a nominee for the annual meeting must update and supplement the notice required by Article I, Section 12 of our Bylaws so that the information in the notice is true and correct as of the record date for the annual meeting and as of the date that is 15 days prior to the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; such update and supplement shall be delivered in writing to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not later than five days after the record date for the meeting (in the case of any update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than 10 days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update and supplement required to be made as of 15 days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof). We may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director. Any stockholder that intends to submit a nominee should read the entirety of the requirements in our Bylaws, particularly Article I, Section 12, which can be found under the "Corporate Governance" area within the "Investors" section of our website at http://investors.premierinc.com/corporate-governance/. 
Evaluation of Candidates 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider all candidates identified through the processes described above, and will evaluate each of them, including incumbents, based on the same criteria. The selection process involves rigorous vetting of both independent and non-independent director candidates by the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Chair of the Board and senior management to ensure the best qualified individuals are appointed to the Board. Ultimately, background and reference checks will be conducted, and the Committee will meet to finalize its list of recommended candidates for the Board's consideration. The candidates recommended for the Board's consideration will be those individuals who will create a Board of Directors that is strong in its collective knowledge of, and diverse in skills and experience with respect to, accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis management, risk assessment, information technology and cybersecurity, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets. 
Director Independence 
Status as a "Controlled Company" 
We are currently a "controlled company" under NASDAQ rules because our member owners, pursuant to the terms of the VTA, beneficially own more than 50% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a "controlled company," we are not required by NASDAQ for continued listing of our Class A common stock to (i) have a majority of independent directors; (ii) maintain an independent compensation committee or (iii) maintain an independent nominating function. We intend to take advantage of all these exemptions from NASDAQ listing requirements for the foreseeable future. As discussed below, we do maintain an Audit and Compliance Committee comprised entirely of independent directors. Once we cease to qualify as a "controlled company," and after any permitted phase-in period, the Board expects to have a majority of independent directors and independent committees as required by NASDAQ.  Review of Director Independence and Standards for Independence 
On August 8, 2018, the Board of Directors undertook its review of the independence of its directors and director nominees as independent directors based on our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Independent directors must meet the standards of independence established by NASDAQ. The Board reviews annually the independence of each director, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee. Directors have an affirmative obligation to inform the Board of any material changes in their circumstances or relationships that may impact their designation by the Board as independent. 
The Board of Directors assessed whether any director had a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of such director. In addition, the Board assessed whether any of the following relationships existed between us and the director or the director's family members (i.e., spouse, parents, children and siblings or anyone residing in the director's home) that would prohibit a finding of independence under NASDAQ rules: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at any time during the past three years was the director employed by us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from us in excess of $120,000  during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination of independence, other than the following: (i) compensation for Board or Board committee service; (ii) compensation paid to a family member who  is our employee (other than an executive officer) or (iii) benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan, or non-discretionary compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• does the director have a family member who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by us as  an executive officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is the director or his family member a partner in, or a controlling stockholder or an executive officer of, any  organization to which we made, or from which we received, payments for property or services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient's consolidated gross revenues for that year, or $200,000, whichever  is more, other than the following: (i) payments arising solely from investments in our securities or (ii) payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is the director or his family member employed as an executive officer of another entity where at any time during  the past three years any of our executive officers served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is the director or his family member a current partner of our outside auditor, or was a partner or employee of  our outside auditor who worked on our audit at any time during any of the past three years.  
[END TABLE]
In connection with this determination, on an annual basis, each director and executive officer is required to complete a questionnaire which requires disclosure of any transactions with us in which the director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, has a direct or indirect material interest. There were no such transactions indicated for fiscal year 2018. 
In determining the independence of Ms. Wolf, who, until May 2016, was a member of the board of directors of Airgas, Inc., one of our contracted suppliers, our Board of Directors considered the relationship arising through the ordinary course of business between us and Airgas, Inc., but did not view the relationship as materially impacting its independence determination. Ms. Wolf did not have a direct or indirect material interest in such business relationship. 
Determination of Director Independence 
Based on its review, the Board of Directors affirmatively determined that each of Stephen R. D'Arcy, Jody R. Davids, David H. Langstaff, William E. Mayer and Ellen C. Wolf is an independent director in accordance with   our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Each of Barclay E. Berdan, Eric J. Bieber, MD, William B. Downey, Peter S. Fine, Philip A. Incarnati, Marc D. Miller, Marvin R. O'Quinn, Scott Reiner, Terry D. Shaw and Richard J. Statuto is a member-director. Ms. DeVore, who is our Chief Executive Officer, was not deemed to be independent. 
Each of our independent directors satisfies the definition of "independent director" contained in Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ listing standards. As a result of the review and determination above, the Board determined that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee was an independent director under our Corporate Governance  Guidelines and otherwise meets the qualifications for membership on such committee imposed by NASDAQ and other applicable laws and regulations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee had accounting or related financial management expertise and  was financially literate, and otherwise meets the audit committee membership requirements imposed by NASDAQ, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and other applicable laws and regulations; and that Ms. Wolf qualifies as an "audit committee  financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, there are no arrangements or understandings known to us between any of the directors nominated for election to the Board of Directors and any other person pursuant to which a director was or is to be elected as a director or nominee, other than any arrangements or understandings with our directors or officers acting solely in their capacities as such. None of our directors, nominees or executive officers is a party to any material proceedings adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Committee Memberships and Meetings

Board Committee Charters 
As discussed in more detail in the descriptions of each of our Board committees below, each of our Board committees operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. The charters set forth the purpose, objectives and responsibilities of the respective committee and discuss matters such as committee membership requirements, number of meetings and the setting of meeting agendas. The charters are assessed periodically by the Nominating and Governance Committee and the respective committee and are updated by the Board as needed. The Board committee charters are available under the "Corporate Governance" area within the "Investors" section of our website at http://investors.premierinc.com/corporate-governance/. You may also request copies by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 13034 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28277, or by calling 1-704-816-4662. 
Audit and Compliance Committee 
Our Audit and Compliance Committee is intended to meet the requirements of a separately designated standing audit committee as defined under Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Audit and Compliance Committee must consist of at least three members of the Board, with each member satisfying the independence requirements for directors and audit committee members under NASDAQ rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange   Act. Each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee must be financially literate, and at least one member of the Audit and Compliance Committee must have past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting or other comparable experience or background demonstrating financial management experience, as each such qualification is interpreted by the Board in its business judgment. In addition, to the extent practicable, at least one member of the Audit and Compliance Committee shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as such term is defined by the SEC. 
The specific responsibilities of the Audit and Compliance Committee set forth under its charter are, among others, to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Conflict Advisory Committee conducts an annual performance evaluation of itself, including an evaluation of compliance with its charter, pursuant to the Board self-assessment process. The Conflict Advisory Committee annually reviews and reassesses the adequacy of its charter and recommends any proposed changes to the Audit and Compliance Committee for approval. The Conflict Advisory Committee may request any of our officers or employees or our outside counsel to attend its meetings or to meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Conflict Advisory Committee. 
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
Director Compensation Policy 
In 2013, the Board approved a Director Compensation Policy to provide an incentive to attract and retain the services of qualified persons to serve as directors. The policy applies to each director who is not an employee of, or compensated consultant to, us or any of our affiliates ("non-employee director"). The policy is designed to achieve the following key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of the non-employee directors and stockholders;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• support overall organizational objectives and encourage the creation of stockholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain high quality talent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reflect the broad spectrum of talent and diverse sources of market data;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• target median competitive pay levels; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be simple to understand and administer.  
[END TABLE]
In August 2016, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, based on market analysis of director compensation generally, peer group analysis of director compensation and discussions with the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, the Board amended the Director Compensation Policy, effective January 1, 2017. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board reviews the policy from time to time to assess whether any adjustments to the type and amount of director compensation should be made in order to fulfill the objectives of the policy. Only the Board may amend this policy. 
On December 1, 2017, our stockholders approved an amendment to our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan that increased the director compensation limit under our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. As amended, annual cash fees (including cash retainers and meeting fees) and equity compensation that may be earned during a calendar year cannot exceed $500,000.  The following table sets forth the compensation elements and levels for non-employee directors and reflects the compensation for the enhanced responsibilities and time commitment associated with the positions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Director Compensation Elements    Amount

(1)  Each non-employee director will receive an annual equity award of  restricted stock units valued at $125,000, with the exception of any director whose employer prohibits the receipt by such individual of equity-based awards from Premier. Non-employee directors prohibited from  receiving equity-based compensation will receive an annual cash award of $100,000 in lieu of the annual equity award.  
[END TABLE]
Components of Director Compensation 
Cash Retainer and Fees—The amounts in the "Fees Earned or Paid in Cash" column under the Fiscal Year 2018 Director Compensation Table below are retainers and meeting fees earned for serving on our Board, its committees and as committee chairs and Chair of the Board during fiscal year 2018. All annual retainers are paid quarterly. Each outside director receives his or her cash compensation after first being elected or appointed to the Board on a pro-rated basis for the number of days during which he or she provides service. If an outside director dies, resigns or is removed during any quarter, he or she shall be entitled to a cash payment on a pro-rated basis through his or her last day of service. 
Equity or Cash Awards—On January 25, 2018, each non-employee director then serving on the Board received an award of restricted stock units (RSUs) with a grant date fair value, computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, of $125,018, with the exception of any non-employee director whose employer prohibits the receipt by such individual of equity-based awards from Premier. If a director provides a written certification stating that he or she is prohibited by his or her employer from receiving equity-based compensation from Premier, then such director will receive an annual cash award of $100,000 in lieu of the annual equity award. With respect to equity grants, grant date fair value assumptions are consistent with those disclosed in Note 16—Stock-Based Compensation to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. In fiscal year 2018, each non-employee director, except Barclay E. Berdan and Terry D. Shaw, was awarded 3,733 RSUs, with a grant date fair market value of $33.49 per share based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the award date, January 25, 2018. Each of Barclay E. Berdan and Terry D. Shaw received a cash award of $100,000. Each annual equity award, and each annual cash award granted in lieu of the annual equity award, will vest one full year after the grant date. Directors who begin their service mid-year will receive a pro-rated equity or cash award, as applicable. 
Expense Reimbursement—Each non-employee director will be reimbursed for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses incurred in connection with attending meetings of the Board and its committees or in connection with other business related to the Board. Each non-employee director will also be reimbursed for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses authorized by the Board or one of its committees that are incurred in connection with attendance at meetings with our management.  All Other Compensation—Each director is entitled annually to direct an amount of $1,000 to his or her selected not-for-profit organization during the holiday season in lieu of receipt of a holiday gift. No compensation or benefits other than those described above are payable to any directors for Board service. 
Director Education Policy 
We believe that we and our stockholders are best served by a Board of Directors comprised of individuals who are well versed in modern principles and "best practices" of corporate governance and other subject matters relevant to board service, including matters related to the healthcare industry, and who thoroughly comprehend the role and responsibilities of board membership. Under our Director Education Policy, we provide both internal and external educational opportunities and association memberships for our directors. To encourage continuing director education, we reimburse directors up to $7,500 annually for attending U.S.-based director education programs under this policy. Amounts reimbursed include all reasonable costs associated with attending each program, including travel, lodging and meals. Directors serving on multiple boards are encouraged to obtain pro rata reimbursement of their director education expenses from each company that they serve, but we will nonetheless reimburse 100% of the costs if this is not practicable. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our stock ownership guidelines require our non-employee directors to hold our Class A common stock equal in value to at least three times the annual cash retainer. The non-employee directors are expected to meet the stock ownership guideline level within five years after receipt of their first equity-based award for service to the Board and to continuously own sufficient shares to satisfy the guideline level once attained for as long they remain a member of the Board. If a director provides us with a written certification stating that he or she is prohibited by his or her employer from receiving equity-based compensation from Premier, then such director will not receive equity-based awards from us and, accordingly, will not be subject to the stock ownership guidelines. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Director Compensation Table 
Compensation in the table below reflects amounts earned in fiscal year 2018 by our non-employee directors serving on our Board for all or a portion of fiscal year 2018. Ms. DeVore, the only director who is also an employee, receives no additional compensation for serving on the Board.

We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our officers and directors. With certain exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification of expenses and liabilities incurred by the indemnified individual in connection with a proceeding related to his or her service to us as an officer or director (including, among other things, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and settlement amounts). 
We believe these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified people who will be free from undue concern about personal liability in connection with their service to us.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following tables set forth information, as of the Record Date, regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock by (i) each person known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of any class of the outstanding voting securities of Premier, (ii) each of our directors, director nominees and Named Executive Officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 and (iii) all of our directors, director nominees and executive officers as a group. In preparing the following table, we relied upon statements filed with the SEC by the beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock pursuant to Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock reflected as beneficially owned. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Accordingly, the following table accounts for shares of Class A common stock issuable (i) upon the exercise of currently exercisable stock options and stock options that vest within 60 days of the Record Date and (ii) upon the vesting of performance shares or restricted stock units that vest within 60 days of the Record Date.

(1)  In connection with our reorganization and IPO, the member owners were issued Class B common units in  Premier LP and an equivalent number of shares of Premier, Inc. Class B common stock. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, each member owner has the cumulative right, subject to certain restrictions, commencing on October 31,  2014, and during each year thereafter, to exchange up to one-seventh of its initial allocation of Premier LP Class B common units, as well as any additional Premier LP Class B common units purchased by such member owner pursuant to certain  rights of first refusal set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on a quarterly basis, for shares of Premier, Inc. Class A common stock (on a one-for-one basis), cash  or a combination of both, the form of consideration to be at the discretion of the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. For each Premier LP Class B common unit that is exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the  member owner will also surrender one corresponding share of Premier Class B common stock, which will automatically be retired. As of the Record Date, there were 79,409,403 Class B common units outstanding. On October 31, 2018,  the next quarterly exchange date under the Exchange Agreement, 48,973,436 Class B common units of Premier LP will be eligible for exchange under the Exchange Agreement. Based on indicated participation in the October 31, 2018 Class B  common unit exchange process, as of the October 15, 2018, a maximum of 9,833,739 Class B common units will be exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, cash or a combination thereof, as determined by our Audit and Compliance Committee.  Correspondingly, we expect an equal number of shares of Class B common stock to be removed from the Class B Voting Trust and retired. Following the completion of the exchange process, assuming we settled the exchange solely with shares of  Class A common stock, we expect the Class B common stock to represent approximately 52.2% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined. Assuming we settled the exchange solely with cash, we expect the  Class B common stock to represent approximately 56.3% of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock combined. See "Frequently Asked Questions—What is the Class B Common Unit Exchange Process? Will it  impact the Annual Meeting?" above for additional information regarding the timing and impact of exchange process, the Record Date and the cancellation of Class B common stock. On or about October 31, 2018, we expect to file with the  SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the final results of the October 31, 2018 exchange process.  
(2)  Combined Voting Power represents the percentage of voting power of the Class A common stock and  Class B common stock of Premier voting together as though a single class. These percentages account for the (i) exercise of currently exercisable stock options and stock options that vest within 60 days of the Record Date; and  (ii) number of RSUs and performance shares that are expected to vest within 60 days of the Record Date. The percentages are based on 53,925,158 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 79,409,403 shares of  Class B common stock outstanding as of the Record Date.  
(3)  Our member owners, including GNYHA Purchasing Alliance, LLC ("GNYHA PA") and Adventist Health System  Sunbelt Healthcare Corporation ("AHS"), are the beneficial owners of our Class B common stock. In connection with our reorganization and IPO, our member owners entered into the VTA pursuant to which the member owners contributed their  Class B common stock to the Class B Voting Trust, under which a trustee will act on behalf of the member owners for purposes of voting their Class B common stock. As a result of the VTA, the Trustee has voting power over the member  owners' Class B common stock; however, the member owners retain investment power over the Class B common stock. The business address of Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee, is 919 N. Market Street, Suite 1600,  Wilmington, Delaware 19801. Following the expected Class B common unit exchanges discussed in footnote 1 above, the shares of Class B common stock surrendered in connection with such exchanges will no longer be included in the Class B  Voting Trust.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by the Exchange Act to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. As an administrative matter, we assist our executive officers and directors by monitoring transactions and filing Section 16 reports on their behalf. Based on our records, compliance program and review of written representations, we believe that during fiscal year 2018 our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.  RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Policy on Oversight of Related Person Transactions 
We have several written policies and codes in place that govern, among other things, related party transactions and potential conflicts of interest. In addition, several of the committees of our Board of Directors have oversight responsibility for related party transactions and potential conflicts of interest. Transactions between us and our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders must be approved by our Audit and Compliance Committee, which is comprised of independent members of our Board of Directors, following consultation with the Conflict Advisory Committee. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for the review and approval, in accordance with our Code of Conduct, of all related party transactions requiring disclosure under SEC Regulation S-K Item 404 (i.e., those in excess of $120,000). This obligation is executed primarily through oversight of and collaboration with the Conflict Advisory Committee. The Conflict Advisory Committee charter authorizes that Committee to oversee all business or personal transactions between officers or directors or their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our affiliates, on the other hand. Additionally, the Conflict Advisory Committee was established in light of our controlled company status, the fact that we have member-directors on our Board of Directors and the need to establish governance around our member owners' health system business development plans as well as our objective to collaborate on potential new business with our member owners. The Conflict Advisory Committee may recommend actions ranging from disclosure to recusal or resignation to the Audit and Compliance Committee for their consideration and action. In addition, the Member Agreement Review Committee is responsible for reviewing and providing feedback to our management with respect to non-ordinary course transactions between us or our subsidiaries and our member owners and also for assessing risks associated with agreements that we enter into with our member owners. 
The above committees are permitted to engage outside advisors and other professionals to assist them with their stated duties, including evaluating and approving any transaction between us and any related party, including our member owners.
For more information regarding the evaluation of related party transactions and potential conflicts of interest, see "Corporate Governance and Board Structure—Corporate Governance—Code of Ethics," "—Committees of the Board of Directors—Audit and Compliance Committee," "—Member Agreement Review Committee" and "—Conflict Advisory Committee" above.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Linking Executive Compensation to Our Mission, Vision and Values 
We are confident that our executive compensation program provides a sound linkage between our Mission, Vision and Values and our stockholders' interests, and we encourage a thorough review of our CD&A and other information in this "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement to ensure a better understanding of our program and this linkage. 
Our Mission is to improve the health of communities. 
Our Vision is through the collaborative power of the Premier alliance, we will lead the transformation to high-quality, cost-effective healthcare. 
Our Values are integrity, passion for performance, innovation and a focus on people. 
From serving our members, to improving healthcare in our communities, to investing in our people, our Mission, Vision and Values are at the heart of everything we do at Premier. Within this context, we design all of our compensation programs, including the structure of our executive compensation program, to accomplish the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Hire exceptionally talented people who are passionate about our Mission and Vision and exemplify our  Values;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Drive sustained performance of our people to achieve challenging short- and long-term financial and  operational goals that increase stockholder value; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retain the strongest and most diverse talent who are critical to the achievement of our Mission and  realization of our Vision.

Our 2017 Stockholder Say-on-Pay Vote 
At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we sought stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in our 2017 proxy statement ("say-on-pay" vote). We hold our say-on-pay vote annually. In 2017, approximately 99.4% of the say-on-pay votes cast were votes "FOR" our executive compensation program. As evidenced by this strong backing, we believe our stockholders generally support our compensation principles, programs and governance practices. Our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors considered the 2017 advisory say-on-pay vote results, as well as comments from our stockholders, and decided not to change the overall structure of our executive compensation program.  Highlights of Our 2018 Performance 
Our fiscal year 2018 performance was strong, both financially and operationally, and exceeded our fiscal year 2017 performance on key financial metrics used, in part, in determining fiscal year 2018 NEO compensation. Set forth below is a comparison of our total Net Revenue, Non-GAAP Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") and Non-GAAP Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share ("Adjusted EPS") for fiscal years 2017 and 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Represents Total Net Revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP as reported in our 2018 Form 10-K.  
(2)  Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before merger and  acquisition related expenses and non-recurring, non-cash or non-operating items and including equity in net income (loss) of  unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest and investment income, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and amortization of purchased intangible assets.  Non-recurring items include income or expenses and other items that have not been earned or incurred within the prior two years and are not expected to recur within the next two years. Such items include  certain strategic and financial restructuring expenses. Non-operating items include gain or loss on disposal of assets and interest and investment income or expense.  
(3)  We define Non-GAAP Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share, or  Adjusted EPS, as Non-GAAP Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares. We define Non-GAAP Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as  net income attributable to Premier (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the impact of adjustment of redeemable limited partners' capital to redemption amount, (iii) excluding the effect of non-recurring and non-cash items, (iv) assuming the exchange of all the Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock, which results in the  elimination of non-controlling interest in Premier LP and (v) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on Non-GAAP Fully Distributed Net Income before income  taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. Reflects income tax expense at an estimated effective income tax rate of 32% of Non-GAAP adjusted fully distributed income before income taxes for fiscal year  2018.  
[END TABLE]
We use Non-GAAP financial metrics in our executive compensation program to more fairly evaluate our performance on a year-over-year basis by removing certain items outside the control of our management team. We note that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, any measure of our performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS and our rationale for using these performance metrics are further discussed below—see "Annual Incentive Plan and Equity Plan Metric Definitions." Also see Appendix B to this proxy statement or our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on our use of Non-GAAP financial metrics as well as a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures.  OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
Our executive compensation principles and governance practices are designed to promote and protect our stockholders' interests. The table below outlines the foundational principles used in the design of our executive compensation program and the practices that govern the program.

Our Executive Compensation Key Objectives 
In setting and overseeing our executive compensation program, our Compensation Committee focuses on the following key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain exceptional and diverse executive talent  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Support business objectives  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage the creation of stockholder value by focusing executive pay more on long-term equity compensation than  short-term incentives and cash  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recognize our unique business structure and focus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reflect the broad spectrum of talent and diverse sources of market data  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide reward opportunities consistent with business performance  
[END TABLE]
We design our executive compensation program in light of these key objectives by: 
Our Peer Group 
We use a peer group of companies to analyze external market compensation practices. We consider this information when implementing competitive and performance-driving compensation packages for our NEOs. With input from management and Mercer, our compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee reviews the peer group annually so that its composition remains appropriate. Each year, we compare our compensation programs with those of our peer group and assess whether our executive compensation programs and target compensation levels are consistent with market practice. 
In constructing our peer group, the Compensation Committee reviews information for and considers publicly-traded companies in the U.S. with the following attributes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Similar business orientation and industry classifications (healthcare services, technology, distributors,  research and consulting)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Similar services (group purchasing, supply chain services, integrated/specialty pharmacy, technology/data,  population health and performance management)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue that is approximately one-third to three times that of ours   
[END TABLE]
 The Compensation Committees also considers other relevant factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market capitalization, total number of employees and revenue less cost of goods sold  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive positions similar in breadth, complexity and/or scope of responsibility  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitors for customers and executive talent  
[END TABLE]
Based on these considerations as well as input from Mercer and our management, our Compensation Committee reviewed and approved our peer group for fiscal year 2018, comprised of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Advisory Board Company      IHS Markit, Ltd. 
   Allscripts Healthcare Solutions      Magellan Health, Inc. 
   athenahealth, Inc.      Navigant Consulting, Inc. 
   Cerner Corp.      Owens & Minor, Inc. 
   HMS Holdings Corp.      Patterson Companies, Inc. 
   Huron Consulting Group, Inc.      Quality Systems, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
As we grow and evolve, and as the companies in our peer group change (e.g., due to merger, acquisition, delisting), our Compensation Committee will continue to review and reconfigure our peer group as appropriate. 
The table below summarizes and compares our revenue and market capitalization to that of the peer group as of June 30, 2017. Excluding Premier, the median annual revenue of the peer group is $1.365 billion, which is lower than our fiscal year 2017 revenue; the median market capitalization of the peer group is $2.030 billion, which is lower than our market capitalization as of June 30, 2017.

Our Competitive Positioning 
Our Compensation Committee reviews the median peer group data for total direct compensation (at target), including base salary and annual and long-term incentives. Company and individual performance and other factors, including potential succession and, where applicable, compensation levels relative to general survey data, ultimately determine whether target compensation for our NEOs is above or below the peer group median. 
In determining appropriate compensation levels for our NEOs, our Compensation Committee reviews compensation levels for executives in similarly-situated roles at companies in our peer group. Mercer initially compiles the compensation data for the selected peer group; at the request of the Compensation Committee, management reviews and evaluates Mercer's compensation data.  Our Pay Mix 
Our pay mix is an important aspect of our executive compensation program; our use of at-risk pay is designed to drive annual and long-term performance, enhance retention and maintain competitiveness with the external marketplace. 
The charts below compare our CEO's and other NEOs' total direct compensation mix (base salary, target annual incentive and equity incentive) to the average total direct compensation mix of the CEOs and NEOs of our peer group, as compiled by our compensation consultant. 
Pay mix for our NEOs was determined using the NEOs' annual base salary and target annual and equity incentive (assuming target or 100% performance for performance-based equity under our equity plan) for fiscal year 2018. Pay mix for our peer group was determined using the annual base salary, target annual incentive and annual grant date fair value opportunity of long-term incentive awards as reported in peer group companies' 2017 proxy statements filed with the SEC. 
Our CEO's total direct compensation mix is in line with the average target total direct compensation of the CEOs in our peer group. Our NEO pay mix is also very similar to the average at-risk pay levels of our peer group.  Overview of Primary Executive Compensation Elements 
The table below summarizes the primary elements of our NEOs' fiscal year 2018 executive compensation program, including a description and purpose of each element. In addition to the elements summarized in the table below, our NEOs are eligible to participate in a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan and a company-wide defined contribution (i.e., 401(k) savings) program. A more detailed description of all of our compensation elements, along with related 2018 actions for each element, if applicable, follows this table.

 DESCRIPTION OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM ELEMENTS 
Base Salary 
Overview 
Base salary is the singular fixed pay element of our total direct compensation paid to our NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries for NEOs in similarly-situated roles in our peer group and general survey data, and determines NEOs' salaries based on roles, responsibilities, Company and individual performance and potential to assume roles with a higher level of responsibility and experience. Our Compensation Committee reviews each NEO's base salary annually, or more frequently if there is a change in a NEO's scope of responsibilities, and considers whether base salary increases are warranted. Base salary changes, if any, are generally effective September 1 for all of our employees, including NEOs. 
2018 Actions 
To maintain their compensation position relative to peer group and general survey data levels and to reflect the importance of retaining them in their positions, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Anderson's and Ms. Rakowski's base salary in fiscal year 2018. The base salaries for all other NEOs remained unchanged for fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee's decision to maintain base salary levels for all other NEOs was not reflective of the NEOs' performance; rather, our Compensation Committee generally focuses initially on making compensation adjustments to short- and long-term incentive pay, based on the factors listed above. 
Our NEOs' fiscal year 2017 and 2018 base salaries are set out in the table below.

Our Annual Incentive Plan 
Overview 
Our annual incentive plan is a one-year cash-based incentive designed to drive and reward NEOs for delivering annual financial and member results relative to pre-established performance thresholds during a fiscal year. Our Compensation Committee determines the annual incentive structure, performance metrics and goals and each NEO's threshold, target and maximum award opportunity at the beginning of the fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee then determines the actual payment amount for each NEO based on our fiscal year financial and member performance. 
In fiscal year 2018, the annual incentive plan for our NEOs was based 80% on our financial performance and 20% on certain components of our operating performance. Payouts for financial performance were tied equally to Revenue and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. Payouts for operating performance were tied equally to Member Quality and Member Cost indices.  The Compensation Committee chose these metrics and weightings for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA drive  top- and bottom-line financial growth in the support of our Mission and Vision;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA are important indicators of the  operational strength and performance of the business, including the ability to provide the capital necessary to execute upon our business and growth strategies and to fund capital expenditures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An equal weighting of financial goals helps drive a balance between top-  and bottom-line performance so that increasing Revenue does not come at the expense of declining margins;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equally weighted member performance indices create greater alignment with our member organizations and  incentivize our executives to assist the organizations in becoming top industry performers in quality, safety, supply chain cost and total cost of care; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• These metrics and weightings incentivize all NEOs to collaborate on, and align to a singular, company-wide focus.

To maintain compensation position relative to peer group and general survey data levels, increase emphasis on annual financial and operational performance, and reflect increased responsibilities and the importance of retaining them in their position, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Anderson's and Ms. Rakowski's fiscal year 2018 target annual award opportunity to 60% of annual base salary, from 50% and 55%, respectively. The target annual award opportunity for all other NEOs remained unchanged for fiscal year 2018. Mr. Gilbert did not earn an annual incentive plan award for fiscal year 2018 due to a termination of employment on December 31, 2017.  Annual Incentive Plan Calculation 
The Compensation Committee used the calculation below to determine fiscal year 2018 annual incentive plan awards for our NEOs. This is the same calculation method the Compensation Committee used to determine awards for fiscal year 2017:

 Our Equity Plan 
Overview 
We design our equity grants to align our NEOs' interests with those of our stockholders. In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee granted equity awards to our NEOs, whereby 60% of the grant represented performance-based restricted stock units, 20% of the grant value represented nonqualified stock options ("NQSOs"), and 20% of the grant represented time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs"), as outlined in the chart below. The Compensation Committee feels this mix provides proper alignment with stockholders' interests and has an appropriate emphasis on long-term company performance. 
The Compensation Committee determines the type of awards to be granted and the amount of individual awards granted to NEOs, based on an analysis of competitive long-term incentive market practices within our peer group generally, and across the healthcare supply chain and informatics industry (based on compensation surveys) for each executive's position. The Compensation Committee believes this mix of equity vehicles supports our long-term objectives by emphasizing performance-based equity (performance shares and NQSOs) over time-based equity awards (RSUs). 
The annual grant date for performance shares, NQSOs and RSUs is typically in the second month of the first quarter of the fiscal year; fiscal year 2018 equity awards were granted on August 25, 2017.  2018 Grant Calculations 
The Compensation Committee uses the following calculation to determine the (i) target number of shares underlying performance shares, NQSOs and RSUs awarded to each NEO, and (ii) actual number of shares earned by each NEO under the performance shares at the end of the performance cycle. 
Target Award 
Each NEO's equity target award is expressed as a percentage of her/his annual base salary, and is determined by the Compensation Committee annually based on each NEO's role, responsibilities, external market information (including the long-term incentive practices of our peer group) and long-term NEO potential and performance. 
2018 Actions 
To maintain their compensation position relative to peer group and general survey data levels, and to reflect the importance of retaining each in their position, the Compensation Committee increased the equity target awards for Mr. Alkire, Mr. McKasson, Mr. Anderson and Ms. Rakowski. Mr. Alkire's fiscal year 2018 equity award target was changed from 300% to 325%. Mr. McKasson's fiscal year 2018 equity target was changed from 275% to 300%. Mr. Anderson's fiscal year 2018 equity target was changed from 122% to 150%. Ms. Rakowski's fiscal year 2018 equity target was changed from 100% to 150%. The equity awards for Ms. Rakowski and Mr. Anderson also correspondingly increased due to increases in their respective annual base salaries. 
The fiscal year 2018 equity grants for our NEOs are summarized in the table below:

[END TABLE]
 Performance Shares 
Performance shares are designed to focus on and drive achievement of long-term financial objectives, and to maximize stockholder return. The target number of performance shares granted to NEOs is based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as of the grant date, August 25, 2017. The fiscal year 2018 grants are for the fiscal three-year performance cycle beginning on July 1, 2017, and ending June 30, 2020. In August 2017, the Compensation Committee established a threshold, target and stretch performance level for performance shares based on our long-term growth strategy. Following the end of the performance cycle, the Compensation Committee will determine and award shares based on performance results. For performance below threshold, no shares will be awarded; for performance at threshold, 50% of target shares will be awarded; at target, 100% of target shares will be awarded; at stretch, 150% of target shares will be awarded. For performance between threshold and target or between target and stretch, the Compensation Committee will use straight-line interpolation to determine results and corresponding awards. Provided the Compensation Committee certifies performance at or above the threshold level, shares will generally be awarded in the first fiscal quarter following the end of the performance cycle. See the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" table under "—Executive Compensation Tables" below for potential share awards based on threshold, target and stretch performance. 
Non-Qualified Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units 
For fiscal year 2018, in addition to performance shares as discussed above, which represented 60% of our NEOs' total target equity award opportunity, the Compensation Committee granted 20% of our NEOs' total target equity award opportunity in NQSOs and 20% in RSUs. This equity mix balances the performance value of NQSOs with the retention reinforcement of RSUs. NQSOs vest ratably over three years, one-third on or about each anniversary of the grant date. The number of NQSOs granted is based on the Black-Scholes estimated value as of the grant date, and the exercise price for NQSOs is the closing price of our Class A common stock on the grant date. RSUs vest 100% on or about the third anniversary of the grant date. The size of the RSU grant is based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the grant date. Actual fiscal year 2018 equity grants for our NEOs are presented in the "2018 Equity Grants" table above and in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" table under "—Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Performance Goal for Performance Shares 
The actual number of shares that will be awarded to our NEOs at the end of the performance cycle, pursuant to the 2018 Performance Share grants, will be based 100% on Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS performance. See "—Annual Incentive Plan and Equity Plan Metrics Definitions" and Appendix B for a description of this metric. 
The Compensation Committee used Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS for the 2018 performance shares grant because it believes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EPS drives a balance of long-term top- and bottom-line growth;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EPS is a critical indicator of the long-term operational strength of our business, including the ability  to provide cash flows necessary to execute upon our business and growth strategies and fund strategic capital expenditures; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EPS performance is aligned with long-term stockholder value creation.

 Amounts Earned under Fiscal Year 2016 Performance Share Grants 
Following the end of fiscal year 2018, our Compensation Committee determined the payouts under our performance shares granted in fiscal year 2016, which is based on our performance during the 2016 through 2018 fiscal years. The table below summarizes the performance metrics, weightings and goals for these awards along with our actual performance and earned percentage. In determining actual performance under fiscal year 2016 performance shares, the Compensation Committee neutralized (i.e., excluded) the benefit of the Company's tax rate decrease as a result of the TCJA. The Compensation Committee determined that actual performance achieved/exceeded the stretch performance level.

(2)  In determining actual performance under fiscal year 2016 performance shares, the Compensation Committee  neutralized the benefit of the Company's tax rate decrease as a result of the TCJA. Including the impact (i.e., benefit) of the TCJA would have resulted in actual performance of 17.3%, which also exceeded the stretch performance level and would  have resulted in an earned percentage of 150.0%. See Appendix B to this proxy statement for the neutralization reconciliation of our Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS to actual performance for fiscal year  2016 performance shares.

 Requiring Stock Ownership 
To further align our NEOs' and stockholders' interests, the Compensation Committee requires each executive to accumulate and hold a significant amount of our Class A common stock. We believe our stock ownership requirements are comparable to those of our peer group. The table below summarizes our ownership and holding requirement provisions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
As of June 30, 2018, all NEOs were within their respective five-year phase-in periods. The Compensation Committee evaluates the status of stock ownership requirements annually in August. The phase-in period for Ms. DeVore and Messrs. Alkire and McKasson ended in September 2018. As of June 30, 2018, Ms. DeVore held Premier stock at a level greater than five times her base salary, and Messrs. Alkire and McKasson held greater than three times their respective base salaries. Thus, they meet their stock ownership requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee's review. 
Annual Incentive Plan and Equity Plan Metric Definitions 
As noted above, we used Revenue, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS for our NEO's incentive plans. The Compensation Committee believes that Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS reflect the items that management has under its control through operational performance. 
We believe Adjusted EBITDA assists our Compensation Committee and management in making financial, operating and strategic decisions and in evaluating our performance on a consistent basis from period to period. Doing so removes the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team (e.g., taxes), as well as other non-cash (impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation) and non-recurring items (strategic and financial restructuring expenses) from operating results.  We also believe Adjusted EPS aligns our long-term focus and our stockholders' interests while assisting our Compensation Committee and management in making financial, operating and strategic decisions and in evaluating our performance on a consistent basis from period to period. Doing so removes non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation) and non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses). It also eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member owner exchanges of Class B common units into shares of Class A common stock. 
See Appendix B to this proxy statement and our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on our use of non-GAAP financial metrics and definitions of terms used in the table below as well as a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures.

[END TABLE]
 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
NEOs are eligible to participate in our voluntary, non-qualified executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which is provided for recruitment purposes and to assist executives in managing their future cash flow. The program allows NEOs to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 30% of their base salary and annual incentive plan award, and receive a company matching contribution of 100% of the first 3% deferred and 50% of the next 2% deferred. We provide this match for eligible compensation above the annual IRS compensation limit. Distributions are generally not allowed while NEOs are actively employed. The investment choices are similar to those offered to eligible employees in our 401(k) plan, and the plan does not offer above-market earnings. NEOs elect to receive post-separation distributions in either a lump sum or in annual installments over five years. For additional information on this program, see the "Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018" and "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Benefits for Fiscal Year 2018" tables below. 
Defined Contribution (401(k) Savings) Program 
Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our qualified defined contribution 401(k) Plan, under which they have the opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation, up to tax code limitations, and receive a company matching contribution of 100% of the first 3% of contributions and 50% of the next 2% of contributions. We provide this match for eligible compensation below the annual IRS compensation limit. 
Employment Agreements 
We extend employment agreements to our NEOs, which include non-compete covenants enforceable under the laws of North Carolina, where our corporate headquarters are located. The employment agreements provide severance protection before and after a change in control event and a minimum level of benefits to our NEOs during the term of the agreement. For additional details, see "—Employment Agreements" below. 
Change in Control Protection 
We provide our NEOs with enhanced severance benefits and additional rights to payment of incentive compensation in the event of a change in control. We structure separation payments to help assure that key personnel, including our NEOs, would be available to assist in the successful transition following a change in control and provide a competitive level of severance protection if the executive officer is involuntarily terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within two years following a change in control. We do not provide automatic vesting of benefits upon a change in control transaction irrespective of performance. In the event that payments in connection with a change in control would trigger an excise tax under Code Section 4999, our agreements limit payments to an amount that will not trigger this tax unless paying all the benefits would provide a larger after-tax benefit to the NEO. We do not provide any tax gross-ups for taxes payable on change in control benefits. We describe the severance arrangements and other benefits provided to NEOs on a change in control (as well as the equity treatment upon certain separations in the event of a change in control) under "—Potential Payments Upon Termination" below. 
Executive Perquisites 
We do not offer our NEOs the executive perquisites that many of our peer group companies offer, such as personal usage of company aircraft, company vehicles or auto allowances, personal drivers, health/country club memberships, etc. We offer our CEO reimbursement for her out-of-pocket medical expenses (see "—Employment Agreements" below for details). We also offer all employees disability benefits, which are calculated as a percentage of base salary, and for which our senior executives, including our NEOs, would be entitled to receive a higher benefit in the event of their disability. We do not provide tax gross-ups.  2018 COMPENSATION ACTIONS FOR OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

[END TABLE]
CLAWBACK POLICY 
We have adopted compensation recoupment or "clawback" policies with respect to all incentive compensation awards, including amounts payable under our annual incentive plan and the equity awards granted under our equity plan that may be earned by our current and former executive officers. If we are required to restate our financial statements due to NEOs' material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, our NEOs who received incentive compensation based on erroneous data in a materially noncompliant financial statement must repay the amount in excess of what they would have received based on that restatement. The repayment obligation extends to any incentive compensation a NEO receives during the three-year period preceding a restatement. 
The Board has the sole discretion and authority to: (i) determine the amount of any incentive-based compensation owed by any current or former executive officer; (ii) determine the means, timing (which in all circumstances will be prompt) and any other requirements by which reimbursement is required to occur, which may include, without limitation, forfeiture of any outstanding incentive award; and (iii) impose any other terms, conditions or procedures (e.g., the imposition of interest charges on un-repaid amounts) to govern the current or former executive officer's repayment of any incentive-based compensation.  The Board has discretion to take such actions it deems necessary to address the events that gave rise to the restatement and to prevent its recurrence, including, to the extent permitted under applicable law: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Dismissing the executive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusting the future compensation of the executive; and/or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Authorizing legal action or taking other action to enforce the executive's obligations to us.   
[END TABLE]
TRADING RESTRICTIONS, ANTI-HEDGING, AND ANTI-PLEDGING POLICY 
Our insider trading policy limits the timing and types of transactions in our securities by our insiders, including our NEOs. Among other restrictions, the policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Allows insiders to trade our securities only during open trading window periods (following earnings releases) or,  in the case of our NEOs, pursuant to a written trading plan adopted under SEC Rule 10b5-1, and only after they have obtained pre-clearance for such transactions or  plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prohibits insiders from trading in options, entering into transactions in warrants, puts or calls and/or any  other derivative or hedging transactions on our securities (other than awards granted under our equity incentive plans).  
[END TABLE]
Additionally, our insider trading policy prohibits our insiders from holding our securities in margin accounts or pledging our securities as collateral for a loan. 
QUALIFYING COMPENSATION FOR TAX DEDUCTIBILITY 
Section 162(m) generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation over $1 million paid for any fiscal year to a company's "covered executives," which include anyone who served as chief executive officer or chief financial officer, or was one of the three other highest paid executive officers who served at any time during the last completed tax year. Chief financial officers were not considered covered employees for tax years beginning before January 1, 2018. Section 162(m) exempts qualifying performance-based compensation paid to executive officers with respect to tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 (including our fiscal year 2018), and in future tax years as well but only if payable under a written binding contract in effect on, and not materially modified after, November 2, 2017. Thus, performance-based awards that are deductible in our current fiscal year and performance-based awards outstanding on November 2, 2017, under a written binding contract that is not materially modified after that date may be exempt from the deduction limit if applicable requirements are met. 
The Compensation Committee has historically structured stock options and incentive awards to executive officers with the intention of qualifying for an exemption to the $1 million deduction limit. On August 21, 2018, the IRS issued initial guidance regarding its interpretation of the transition relief noted above, and the Committee is considering the impact of this guidance with respect to awards granted on or before November 2, 2017. There can be no guarantee that compensation awarded prior to November 2, 2017 will qualify for transition relief under the guidance or otherwise. 
The Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards may result in non-deductible compensation expenses. The Committee expects to approve compensation for periods after fiscal year 2018 that are not fully deductible for income tax purposes.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES

Performance-based restricted stock awards and performance shares provide an opportunity for employees to earn and vest in Class A common stock if specified performance measures are met for a specified performance cycle, which is typically three years. If the minimum performance measure is not met, no award is earned. If at least the minimum performance measure is attained, the earned shares may range from 50% to 150% of the target number of shares. The amounts reported in this table for performance-based restricted stock awards and performance shares are disclosed at target (100%), which is the probable outcome (as of the grant date). Details regarding the performance shares threshold, target and maximum values can be found in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" table below.  Time-based restricted stock awards and RSUs provide an opportunity for employees to vest in Class A common stock if the executive remains employed through a specified date, typically three years from grant. The time-based restricted stock awards and RSUs reported above and granted in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 are based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on the grant date in the same manner as described above for performance-based restricted stock awards and performance shares. 
There can be no assurance that the performance-based restricted stock awards, performance shares, time-based restricted stock awards and RSUs granted to our NEOs will ever be earned or that the value of these awards as earned will equal the amounts disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018. The stock price assumption used to calculate the compensation cost is disclosed in Note 16—Stock Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K. 
To see the value actually received under the 2016 performance shares with respect to the three-year performance cycle ended June 30, 2018, please refer to the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2018" table below. Additional information on all outstanding stock awards is reflected in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at June 30, 2018" table below. 
Options Awards (Column (f)) 
The amounts reported in the Option Awards column are the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted to the NEOs on August 25, 2017, August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value for this purpose are disclosed in Note 16—Stock Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that the options will ever be exercised (in which case no value will be realized by the executive) or that the value on exercise will equal the fair value. 
To see the value actually received upon exercise of options by the NEOs in 2018, refer to the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2018" table below. Additional information on all outstanding option awards is reflected in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at June 30, 2018" table below. 
Non-Equity Incentive Plan (Column (g)) 
The amounts reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan are the annual cash incentives earned by our NEOs under our Annual Incentive Plan. Mr. Gilbert did not receive an incentive payment for 2018.

Option Awards (Column (c)) 
The amounts shown are calculated based on the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of exercise for stock options. 
Stock Awards (Column (e)) 
The amounts shown in this column include RSUs granted in fiscal year 2015 that vested during fiscal year 2018 and performance shares granted in fiscal year 2016 for which the last day of the performance cycle is June 30, 2018. The value of the RSUs is calculated based on the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of the vesting. The value of the performance shares is calculated based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on June 29, 2018 ($36.38), and an achievement of 150% of target, based on the performance achievement over the performance cycle. As of June 30, 2018, the number of shares to be distributed was subject to the approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which occurred in August 2018, and the shares were subsequently distributed. For Mr. Gilbert, the values include RSUs that vested following his termination of employment.

[END TABLE]
Executive Contributions in Last Fiscal Year (Column (b)) 
These amounts were contributed by the executives during fiscal 2018, which are also included in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Compensation" columns of the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018.  Registrant Contributions in Last Fiscal Year (Column (c)) 
Registrant contributions were made in the form of matching contributions, which are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018. 
Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year (Column (d)) 
The earnings reflected in column (d) represent deemed investment earnings or losses for NEO accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan. There is no guaranteed rate of return on amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. No amounts included in column (d) are reported in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 because the Deferred Compensation Plan does not provide for above-market or preferential earnings. 
Aggregate Withdrawals/Distributions (Column (e)) 
Active employees are not able to make withdrawals or receive distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year End (Column (f)) 
The amounts shown reflect each participant's total account balance in the Deferred Compensation Plan as of the end of fiscal year 2018 (June 30, 2018). The Deferred Compensation Plan allows NEOs to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 30% of their base salary and up to 30% of the annual incentive plan award. We make a company matching contribution of 100% of the first 3% deferred and 50% of the next 2% deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. We provide this match only with respect to eligible compensation above the annual IRS compensation limit. Distributions are generally not allowed while NEOs are actively employed. The investment choices are similar to those offered to eligible employees in our 401(k) plan, and the plan does not offer above-market earnings. NEOs elect to receive post-separation distributions in either a lump sum or in annual installments over five years. 
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
The material terms of the compensation provided to our NEOs pursuant to employment agreements between us and each executive are described below. See "—2018 Compensation Actions for Our Named Executive Officers" above for a discussion of 2018 compensation determinations. See "—Potential Payments Upon Termination" below for a description of the payments and benefits that would be provided to our NEOs in connection with a termination of their employment or a change in control of our Company. 
Effective October 1, 2013, we and each of Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire and Mr. McKasson entered into new employment agreements. The term of the employment agreements for each of Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire and Mr. McKasson is three years from the effective date, after which the employment agreement will be automatically extended by adding a one-year term upon each anniversary of the effective date, unless either party timely provides written notice to the contrary. 
Additionally, we and each of Mr. Anderson, Ms. Rakowski and Mr. Gilbert entered into our standard employment agreement effective July 1, 2016, November 1, 2016 and September 16, 2013, respectively. There is no stated employment term under these agreements (i.e., employment is "at-will" whereby the employee may resign at any time for any reason and we may terminate their respective employment at any time for any reason). The agreements provide(d) for certain restrictive covenant protections for us and extend minimum compensation and severance benefits for Mr. Anderson, Ms. Rakowski and Mr. Gilbert.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION 
As noted under the "—Employment Agreements" section above, the employment agreements for each NEO provide for certain payments and benefits upon their respective separation from our Company. These provisions, and the actual termination treatment for Mr. Gilbert and Ms. Rakowski, are summarized below. 
Mr. Gilbert 
Durral Gilbert resigned from his position as Senior Vice President, Supply Chain Services effective October 31, 2017; however, Mr. Gilbert agreed to remain employed by the Company during a transition period, serving in a transition role through December 31, 2017. In connection with his departure, the Company and Mr. Gilbert entered into a Transition Agreement and Release (the "Transition Agreement") on October 9, 2017. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Mr. Gilbert received (i) base salary (in an amount of $38,958 per month) during his transition period through December 31, 2017, subject to applicable withholdings and deductions; (ii) 10 months of severance pay in an aggregate amount of $389,583, subject to applicable withholdings and deductions, paid on a semi-monthly basis over the 10-month period following December 31, 2017; and (iii) additional severance in an aggregate amount of $11,565 for use in paying COBRA insurance premiums or other expenses, subject to applicable withholdings and deductions, paid on a semi-monthly basis over the 10-month period following December 31, 2017. 
The payments above are contingent upon Mr. Gilbert's compliance with certain covenants, including, among other things, (i) refraining from engaging in certain competitive activities as previously agreed to by him for 12 and in some cases 18 months following his separation date, including non-compete and non-solicitation provisions; (ii) preserving and not disclosing the Company's confidential information as previously agreed to by him for five years following his separation date; (iii) fully releasing the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliate companies from all claims arising from his employment with or separation from the Company; and (iv) cooperating and assisting the Company in transitioning his work assignments and responsibilities.  Pursuant to the terms of the Transition Agreement, Mr. Gilbert's outstanding and unvested equity awards following termination are treated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance shares and performance-based restricted stock awards: pro rata portion of the shares will be paid out  upon certification of the actual results under each respective grant, based on the following formula: total number of shares awarded (based on actual performance results) multiplied by the number of days of active service following the beginning of  the respective performance cycle divided by 1,095 days.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs and time-based restricted stock awards: pro rata portion of shares equal to number of days of active service  since the grant date divided by 1,095 days.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• NQSOs: vesting of the portion of the option that would have otherwise vested over the 12-month period following the date of termination. Any vested NQSOs would be exercisable for the time periods set forth in the respective award agreements, generally one year thereafter (but not beyond the original  expiration date).  
[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth quantitative information with respect to payments to Mr. Gilbert upon termination, based on the circumstances and conditions described above. The amounts included in the table below do not include amounts otherwise due and owing to Mr. Gilbert, such as salary earned through the date of termination and vested equity and nonqualified deferred compensation, as those amounts are reflected in the preceding tables or payments or benefits generally available to all of our salaried employees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Durral R. Gilbert    401,148    1,050,241    1,451,389 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Under the terms of the Transition Agreement with Mr. Gilbert, includes (i) 10 months of severance pay in  an aggregate amount of $389,583, subject to applicable withholdings and deductions, payable on a semi-monthly basis over a 10-month period following December 31, 2017; and (ii) additional severance  in an aggregate amount of $11,565 for use in paying COBRA insurance premiums or other expenses, subject to applicable withholdings and deductions, payable on a semi-monthly basis over a 10-month period  following December 31, 2017.  
(2)  Reflects the value of unvested performance shares, performance-based restricted stock, RSUs, restricted stock  and NQSOs that became vested as a result of the termination of employment. For performance-based restricted stock that vested in August 2018, the value is based on the actual achievement of 150% of target and the closing price of our Class A  common stock on August 22, 2018 ($42.65), the date on which the performance achievement was certified; for other performance shares which have not yet vested, the value is based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on  June 29, 2018 ($36.38) and assumes the performance is at target (100%). For RSUs and restricted stock awards, the value is based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on December 29, 2017 ($29.19), the date on which the  RSUs and restricted stock awards vested. For stock options, the value is based on the excess of the closing price of our Class A common stock on December 29, 2017 ($29.19), over the exercise price of stock options  
[END TABLE]
Ms. Rakowski 
Ms. Rakowski resigned from her position as Senior Vice President, Premier Performance Partners effective July 20, 2018. Under this voluntary resignation, Ms. Rakowski will not receive any of the severance payments outlined above and summarized for the other NEOs in the tables below.  Involuntary Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason – Non-Change in Control Event 
Severance benefits in the event the NEO is terminated without cause (other than after a change in control, which is covered below) or resigns for good reason are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire and Mr. McKasson, if terminated without cause or for resignation for  good reason, we will pay 1.9 times the respective executive's annual base salary over 24 months following termination. Good reason applies only under the employment agreements for Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire and Mr. McKasson and means  a resignation due to (i) reduction in position, responsibilities, or status or a change in title resulting in a material reduction in responsibilities or position; (ii) change in reporting responsibility; (iii) reduction in base  salary; (iv) relocation to a location outside a 50-mile radius of the executive's primary office location; (v) our failure to make any material  non-forfeited payments earned or (vi) failure of a successor to assume obligations under executives' employment agreements. A termination without cause under our employment agreements means an  involuntary termination of the executive officer's employment for any reason other than death, disability, cause, or for Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire and Mr. McKasson, good reason.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Per the terms of the agreement for Mr. Anderson, if his employment is terminated without cause, we will pay  his annual base salary for 12 months following termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The NEOs' rights to receive severance benefits upon termination are conditioned upon the execution of a  release of claims against us. Additionally, severance benefits may be reduced or terminated and equity awards may be forfeited if the executive breaches applicable restrictive covenant terms.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance payments may be delayed to the extent necessary for compliance with Section 409A of the Code  governing nonqualified deferred compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event of a termination for cause, or a voluntary resignation, the executives would not receive any of the  severance payments outlined above and summarized in the tables below.  
[END TABLE]
Outstanding equity awards for NEOs for an involuntary termination without cause, or for resignation for good reason, as applicable, would be treated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance shares and performance-based restricted stock awards: pro rata portion of the shares that are earned  based on our performance will be paid out upon certification of the actual results under each respective grant, based on the following formula: total number of shares awarded (based on actual performance results) multiplied by the number of days of  active service following the beginning of the respective performance cycle divided by 1,095 days.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs and time-based restricted stock awards: pro rata portion of shares equal to number of days of active service  since the grant date divided by 1,095 days.

For Mr. Anderson, base salary continuation equals one times annual base salary as of June 30,  2018, paid over 12 months following termination without cause.  
(2)  Reflects the value of unvested performance shares, performance-based restricted stock awards, RSUs, time-based  restricted stock awards and NQSOs that will vest as a result of the termination of employment not for cause or for good reason, as applicable, based on the excess of the closing sale price of our Class A common stock on June 29, 2018  ($36.38), over the exercise price of stock options and the closing sale price of our Class A common stock on June 29, 2018 ($36.38), for performance shares, performance-based restricted stock awards, RSUs and time-based restricted stock  awards, and assumes the performance for performance shares and performance-based restricted stock awards is at target (100%).  
(3)  In addition to the amounts reflected above, additional severance payments may be made for use in paying COBRA  insurance premiums or other expenses These aggregate amounts are estimated to be $12,743, $35,236, $21,006 and $15,266 for Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire, Mr. McKasson and Mr. Anderson, respectively.  
(4)  In the event of an involuntary termination for cause, or a voluntary resignation, the executives would not  receive any of the payments outlined in the table.  
[END TABLE]
Involuntary Termination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason – Change in Control Event 
A termination upon a change in control (as defined in the 2013 EIP), is a termination without cause or a resignation for good reason, as applicable, within 24 months following a change in control. 
For Ms. DeVore, Mr. Alkire and Mr. McKasson, if terminated without cause or for resignation for good reason within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in the 2013 EIP), the severance we will pay is 2.4 times the respective executive's total annual compensation over 30 months following termination. "Total annual compensation" for this purpose means the sum of the executive's then annual base salary, plus the greater of (i) their target annual incentive plan bonus as of termination, or (ii) the average annual incentive plan bonuses paid during the 36 months preceding employment termination. The severance for Mr. Anderson is the same as that unrelated to a change in control. 
We do not provide our NEOs a "gross-up" of any golden parachute excise taxes under the Code. Our equity award agreements include a "modified cutback" provision. Benefits under these equity awards, the employment agreements and other plans and arrangements covering our NEOs are paid out in full or reduced so that the golden parachute excise tax is avoided, whichever produces a better after-tax result for the NEO.  Outstanding equity awards for NEOs for an involuntary termination or resignation for good reason as applicable, within 24 months following a change in control, would be treated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance shares and performance-based restricted stock awards: all shares will be paid out upon certification  of the anticipated performance relative to performance goals from the start of the respective performance cycle to the date of the change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs and restricted stock awards: all unvested shares will vest upon termination within 12 months following a  change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• NQSOs: all NQSOs will fully vest upon termination within 12 months following a change in control. Any vested  NQSOs would be exercisable for the time periods set forth in the respective award agreements, generally one year thereafter (but not beyond the original expiration date).

CEO COMPENSATION RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median-paid employee to the annual total compensation of Ms. DeVore, our CEO. We believe that the pay ratio disclosed below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices, and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
For fiscal year 2018, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, other than Ms. DeVore, was $118,438.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. DeVore's annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2018 Summary  Compensation Table, was $6,505,818.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Ms. DeVore to the median of the  annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 55 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
As permitted under the applicable SEC rules, to identify our median employee among our employee population, we used annualized target cash compensation (the combination of base salary and annual incentive plan bonus, at target) for all full- and part-time employees as of April 1, 2018, as a consistently applied compensation measure. After identifying the median employee based on annualized target cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation programs on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement. Following that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board include the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in our proxy statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with our Annual Meeting and incorporate it by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on August 23, 2018.

Executive Compensation—Role of the Compensation Consultant 
During our fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee directly retained the services of Mercer LLC to provide advice and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on executive officer and Board of Director compensation programs. Mercer's fees for executive compensation consulting to the Compensation Committee for fiscal year 2018 were approximately $349,000. 
During fiscal year 2018, Mercer provided the following services to the Compensation Committee related to executive officer compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attended meetings of the Compensation Committee as the Committee's advisor;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluated the competitive positioning of our executive officers' base salaries, annual incentive and  long-term incentive compensation relative to our peer companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advised on target award levels within the annual and long-term incentive plans and, as needed, on actual  compensation actions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assessed the alignment of executive officer compensation levels relative to our performance against our peer  companies and relative to the Compensation Committee's articulated compensation philosophy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provided advice on the design of our annual and long-term incentive plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advised on the performance measures and performance targets for the annual and long-term incentive programs; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluated the competitive positioning of the compensation of our independent directors and member- directors and  made recommendations for change.  
[END TABLE]
During fiscal year 2018, management retained the services of Mercer to provide compensation and health and welfare consulting, and affiliated MMC companies Marsh and National Economic Research Associates, Inc. to provide insurance services and economic consulting services, respectively. The aggregate fees paid for these services for fiscal year 2018 were approximately $646,000. 
Based in part on the policies and procedures Mercer and the Compensation Committee have in place, the Compensation Committee believes that the advice it receives from the executive compensation consultant, a Mercer representative, is objective and not influenced by Mercer's or its affiliates' relationships with Premier. These policies and procedures include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive compensation consultant receives no incentive or other compensation based on the fees charged to us  for other services provided by Mercer or any of its affiliates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive compensation consultant is not responsible for selling other Mercer or affiliate services to us;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mercer's professional standards prohibit the executive compensation consultant from considering any other  relationships Mercer or any of its affiliates may have with us in rendering his or her advice and recommendations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate the executive compensation consultant;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive compensation consultant has direct access to the Compensation Committee without management  intervention;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee evaluates the quality and objectivity of the services provided by the executive  compensation consultant each year and determines whether to continue to retain the consultant; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The protocols for the engagement (described below) limit how the executive compensation consultant may interact  with management.  
[END TABLE]
While it is necessary for the executive compensation consultant to interact with management to gather information, the Compensation Committee has adopted protocols governing if and when the executive compensation consultant's advice and recommendations can be shared with management. These protocols are included in the Compensation Committee's engagement letter with Mercer. The Compensation Committee also determines the appropriate forum for receiving the executive compensation consultant's recommendations. Where appropriate, management invitees are present to provide context for the recommendations.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 
The following Report of the Audit and Compliance Committee does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent Premier specifically incorporates such information by reference. 
The Board of Directors has the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including the role of oversight of Premier's management. The Audit and Compliance Committee's purpose is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities to Premier and its stockholders by overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes, the qualifications and selection of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by the Company, the Company's Ethics & Compliance Program as directed by the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, and the performance of the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Compliance Committee members' functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of Premier's management or Premier's independent registered public accounting firm. 
In its oversight role, the Audit and Compliance Committee relies on the expertise, knowledge and assurances of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining effective systems of internal and disclosure controls (including internal control over financial reporting), for preparing financial statements and for the public reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"), Premier's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an independent audit of Premier's consolidated financial statements and for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. In this context, the Audit and Compliance Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed with management and EY the fair and complete presentation of Premier's consolidated  financial statements and related periodic reports filed with the SEC (including the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and EY's audit of the Company's internal controls over financial  reporting for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018);

No Participant or any other person shall have any claim to be granted an Award under the Plan at any time, and the Company is not obligated to extend uniform treatment to Participants under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each Participant.

The Committee may delegate to the Company's Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant Awards to Participants who are not Non-Employee Directors or Executive Officers and to interpret and administer Awards for such Non-Employee Directors and Executive OfficersParticipants.

Each grant shall specify whether (or the extent to which) the Option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. Notwithstanding any such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. Options failing to qualify as Incentive Stock Options for any reason will be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options, rather than being forfeited. 
5.6 Exercise Period. 
(a) Subject to Section 18.9, no Option granted under the Plan may be exercised more than ten years from the Grant Date. 
(b) If the Fair Market Value exceeds the Option PriceThe Committee may, in its sole discretion, implement a provision in existing and future grants of Options providing that if, on the last day that an Option may be exercised under an Award Agreement, the affected Participant has not then exercised such Option, such Option shall be deemed to have been exercised the vested portion of such Option in a net exercise under Section 5.3(c) above without the requirement of any further action by the Participant on such last day and the Company shall make the appropriate payment to such Participant after applying minimum required tax withholding. The Committee may delegate this authority to one or more of the Company's officers, who may implement this provision by including it in Award Agreements or including it in the Plan's administrative rules, provided that such officers may not implement such exercise in Options issued to Non-Employee Directors or Executive Officers. 
5.7 Award Agreement. Each grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement containing such terms and provisions as the Committee may determine consistent with the Plan.

Vesting may be further conditioned upon the attainment of Performance Goals established by the Committee. 
6.3 Exercise Period. Subject to Section 18.9, no Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan may be exercised more than ten years from the Grant Date. If a Spread exists on the last day that a Stock Appreciation
A-7

6.4 Award Agreement. Each grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement containing such terms and provisions as the Committee may determine consistent with the Plan. 
6.5 Stock Appreciation Rights—Stock Rights Exemption. Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan are intended to qualify as "stock rights" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(5).

7.2 Consideration. To the extent permitted by Delaware law, each grant may be made without additional consideration from the Participant or in consideration of a payment by the Participant that is less than the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date. 
7.3 Substantial Risk of Forfeiture. Each grant shall provide that the Restricted Shares covered thereby shall be subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code for a period to be determined by the Committee on the Grant Date, and any grant or sale may provide for the earlier termination of such risk of forfeiture in the event of a termination of employment. 
7.4 Dividend, Voting and Other Ownership Rights. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an award of Restricted Shares shall entitle the Participant to dividend, voting and other ownership rights (except for any rights to a liquidating distribution) during the period for which such substantial risk of forfeiture is to continue. Any grant shall require that any or all dividends or other distributions paid on the Restricted Shares during the period of such restrictions be accumulated or reinvested in additional Shares, which shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying Award or such other restrictions as the Committee may determine. 
7.5 Restrictions on Transfer. Each grant shall provide that, during the period for which such substantial risk of forfeiture is to continue, the transferability of the Restricted Shares shall be prohibited or restricted in the manner and to the extent prescribed by the Committee on the Grant Date.

8.2 Dividend Equivalents and Other Ownership Rights. During the Restricted Period, the Participant shall not have any right to transfer any rights under the subject Award and shall not have any rights of ownership in the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units, including the right to vote such Shares, but the Committee may on or after the Grant Date authorize the payment award of dividend equivalents on such shares in cash or additional Shares on a current, deferred or contingent basis with respect to any or all dividends or other distributions paid by the Company. A dividend equivalent will entitle the Participant to receive amounts equal to all or any portion of the dividends or other distributions that would be paid on the Shares covered by such Award if such Shares had been delivered pursuant to such Award (without interest). The Participant receiving the dividend equivalent will have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company until payment of such amounts is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dividend equivalents with respect to dividends paid in stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying Award. In no event may cash dividends be paid on Restricted Stock Units during the Restricted Period.

9.4 Payment of Performance Share Awards. Each grant shall specify the time and manner of payment of Performance Share Awards that shall have been earned. 
9.5 Dividend Equivalents. Under no circumstances may dividend equivalents be granted for any Performance Share Award. 
9.6 Adjustments. If the Committee determines after the Performance Goals have been established that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the Company, or the manner in which it conducts its business, or other events or circumstances render the Performance Goals unsuitable, the Committee shall have sole discretion to modify such Performance Goals, in whole or in part, as the Committee deems appropriate and equitable. The Committee shall also have the right in its sole discretion to increase or decrease the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account additional factors that the Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance Cycle. The provisions of this Section 9.6 shall not apply with respect to Performance-Based Awards and any adjustments modifications with respect to such Awards shall be made solely to the extent permitted under Section 14.24. 
A-9

11. Cash-Based Awards. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Cash-Based Awards to Executive Officers and key employees in such amounts and upon such terms, and subject to such conditions, as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant. The Committee shall determine the maximum duration of the Cash-Based Award, the amount of cash to which the Cash-Based Award pertains, the conditions upon which the Cash-Based Award shall become vested or payable, and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine. Each Cash-Based Award shall specify a cash-denominated payment amount, formula or payment ranges as determined by the Committee. Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award and shall be made in cash. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11, all Cash-Based Awards that are Performance-Based Awards shall only be granted, administered and paid in compliance with all the requirements for Executive Officer Awards set forth in Section 14 below. 
12. Adjustments. The Committee shall make or provide for such adjustments in the (a) limitations specified in Section 3, (b) number of Shares covered by outstanding Awards, (c) Option Price or Base Price applicable to outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights and (d) kind of shares available for grant and covered by outstanding Awards (including shares of another issuer), as the Committee in its sole discretion may in good faith determine to be equitably required in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants that otherwise would result from (x) any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of Shares, recapitalization, extraordinary cash dividend, or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (y) any merger, consolidation, spin—-off, spin—-out, split—-off, split—-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets (other than a normal cash dividend), issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities or (z) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing. In addition, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards under the Plan such alternative consideration as it may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the cancellation or surrender of all Awards so replaced. In the case of Substitute Awards, the Committee may make such adjustments, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, in the terms of Awards as it shall deem appropriate in order to achieve reasonable comparability or other equitable relationship between the assumed awards and the Awards granted under the Plan as so adjusted. 
13. Change in Control. 
13.1 General Rule. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may, but shall not be obligated to do any one or more of the following, in each case without Participant consent: (a) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to, all or any portion of an Award, (b) cancel Awards for a cash payment equal to their fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) which, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be deemed to be equal to the excess, if any, of the consideration to be paid in connection with the Change in Control to holders of the same number of Shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (or, if no consideration is paid 
A-10 
 in any such transaction, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) over the aggregate Option Price (in the case of Options) or Base Price (in the case of Stock Appreciation Rights), (c) provide for the issuance of replacement awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected Awards previously granted hereunder as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, (d) terminate Options without providing accelerated vesting or (e) take any other action with respect to the Awards the Committee deems appropriate. For avoidance of doubt, the treatment of Awards upon a Change in Control may vary among Participants and Types of Awards in the Committee's sole discretion. 
13.2 Settlement of Awards Subject to Performance Goals Upon a Change in Control. Awards subject to satisfying a Performance Goal or Goals shall be settled upon a Change in Control. The settlement amount shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion based upon the extent to which the Performance Goals for any such Awards have been achieved after evaluating actual performance from the start of the Performance Cycle until the date of the Change in Control and the level of performance anticipated with respect to such Performance Goals as of the date of the Change in Control. 
13.3 Change in Control shall mean the earliest to occur of the following events, provided that such event is not also a Management Buyout (as defined below): 
(a) Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities generally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company, provided, however, that for avoidance of doubt, the shareholders owning the Company's Class B common stock shall be treated as the Beneficial Owner with voting control for purposes of this definition, and not any Persons voting the shares subject to a voting trust or other similar arrangement, and further provided that no Change in Control will be deemed to have occurred as a result of a change in ownership percentage resulting solely from an acquisition of securities by the Company or a transaction described in clause (i) of paragraph (b) below; 
(b) There is consummated a Merger of the Company with any other business entity other than (i) a Merger which would result in the securities of the Company generally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such Merger continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into such securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding such securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary at least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such Merger, generally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof and, in the case of such surviving entity or any parent thereof, of a class registered under Section 12 of the Act, or (ii) a Merger effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person is or becomes a Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company's then outstanding voting securities of the Company generally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company; 
(c) The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to an entity where the outstanding securities generally entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to the transaction continue to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into such securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof) 50% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of any such entity generally entitled to vote in such entity's election of directors immediately after such sale and of a class registered under Section 12 of the Act.

i. "Management Buyout" means any event or transaction which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control (a "Transaction") if, in connection with the Transaction, the Participant, Family Members and/or the Participant's Affiliates participate, directly or beneficially, as an equity investor in, or have the option or right to acquire, whether vested or not vested, equity interests of, the acquiring entity or any of its Affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Act) (the "Acquiror") having a percentage interest therein greater than 1%. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a party shall not be deemed to have participated as an equity investor in the Acquiror by virtue of (i) obtaining Beneficial Ownership of any equity interest in the Acquiror as a result of the grant to the party of an incentive compensation award under one or more incentive plans of the Acquiror (including, but not limited to, the conversion in connection with the Transaction of incentive compensation awards of the Company into incentive compensation awards of the Acquiror), on terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those applicable to other employees of the Company at a comparable level as such party immediately before the Transaction, after taking into account normal differences attributable to job responsibilities, title and the like, (ii) obtaining beneficial interest of any equity interest in the Acquiror on terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those obtained in the Transaction by all other shareholders of the Company or (iii) the party's interests in any tax-qualified defined benefit or defined contribution pension or retirement plan in which such party or any Family Member is a participant or beneficiary. 
ii. "Merger" means a merger, share exchange, consolidation or similar business consolidation under applicable law.

14. Requirements for Performance-Based Awards. 
14.1 Grandfathered Awards. In the sole discretion of the Committee, any Grandfathered Awards (as defined below) granted under the Plan may be administered in a manner such that the Award qualifies for the performance-based compensation exemption of Section 162(m) of the Code (each, a "Performance-Based Award"). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan and except as determined by the Committee, any Grandfathered Award which is intended to qualify as a Performance-Based Award shall be subject to any additional limitations imposed under Section 162(m) of the Code that are requirements for qualification as a Grandfathered Award.

A-12 
established by the Committee and relate to one or more of the Performance Criteria, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Committee, as permitted under this Section 14. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the Committee shall have no obligation to grant any Award, whether settled in Shares or cash, in the form of "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, a Covered Employee may receive as Performance-Based Awards a Cash-Based Award subject to Performance Cycle that is twelve months and a Cash-Based Award subject to a Performance Cycle that is more than twelve months in the same calendar year. The Committee shall define in an objective fashion the manner of calculating the Performance Criteria it selects to use for any Performance Cycle. Depending on the Performance Criteria used to establish such Performance Goals, the Performance Goals may be expressed in terms of overall Company performance or the performance of a division, business unit, or an individual. Each Performance-Based Award shall also comply with the provisions set forth below. 
14.2 Grant Procedure. With respect to each Performance-Based Award, the Committee shall select, within the first 90 days of a Performance Cycle, the Performance Criteria for such grant and the Performance Goals with respect to each Performance Criterion (including a threshold level of performance below which no amount will become payable with respect to such Award). Each Performance-Based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable, upon achievement of the various applicable performance targets. The Performance Criteria established by the Committee may be (but need not be) different for each Performance Cycle and different Performance Goals may be applicable to Performance-Based Awards to different Covered Employees. The Committee shall designate whether an Award granted to an Executive Officer or key employee is intended to be a Performance-Based Award at the time of grant. 
14.3 Permissible Performance Criteria. Only one or a combination of the following may be used as Performance Criteria for a Performance-Based Award: growth in net sales or revenue, return measures (including, but not limited to, return on invested capital, assets, capital, equity and sales), gross profit margin; operating expense ratios; operating expense targets; productivity ratios; operating income, gross or operating margins; earnings before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization, net earnings or net income (before or after taxes); earnings per share; cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow return on equity, and cash flow return on investment), working capital targets, funds from operations or similar measure, capital expenditures, share price (including, but not limited to, growth measures and total stockholder return), appreciation in the fair market value or book value of the common stock, economic value added (net operating profit after tax minus the sum of capital multiplied by the cost of the capital), debt to equity ratio / debt levels, quantitative measures of customer satisfaction, market share, acquisitions or strategic transactions, quantitative measures of employee satisfaction / engagement, employee retention / attrition, safety, budget achievement, expense reduction or cost savings, productivity improvements and inventory control / efficiency. 
14.414.2 Permitted Adjustments. The Modification of Performance-Based Awards. Subject to Section 12, with respect to any Performance-Based Awards, the Committee shall not revise any performance goal thereunder or increase the amount of compensation payable thereunder upon the attainment of such performance goal (in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (i) the Committee may reduce or eliminate the number of shares of Common Stock or cash granted or the number of shares of Common Stock vested upon the attainment of such performance goal, and (ii) the Committee, in its discretion, may measure performance against Performance performance Goals goals under a Performance-Based Award by taking one or more of the following actions: (a) excluding each of the following items: (i) events of an "unusual nature" or of a type that indicates "infrequency of occurrence", both as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 225-20 or any successor pronouncement thereto (as reported in the Corporation's financial statements for the Performance Cycle), (ii) exchange rate effects, as applicable, for non-U.S. dollar denominated operating earnings, (iii) the effects to any statutory adjustments to corporate tax rates, (iv) the impact of discontinued operations, (v) losses from discontinued operations, (vi) restatements and other unplanned special charges such as acquisitions, acquisition expenses (including, without limitation, expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets), 
A-13 
 (vi) divestitures, (vii) stock offerings, (viii) stock repurchases, (ix) strategic loan loss provisions and (b) not adjusting for changes in accounting principles.; provided that Aany such action with respect to a Performance-Based Award must be taken by the Committee within the first ninety (90) days applicable to the Performance Cycle or such later time as may be permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code or as would not cause any deduction arising from such Award to be disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code. 
14.5 Certification of Performance Goals and Payment. Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Cycle have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the Performance-Based Awards earned for the Performance Cycle. The Committee shall then determine the actual size of each Covered Employee's Performance-Based Award, and, in doing so with respect to a Cash-Based Award, may reduce or eliminate the amount of such Award if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate. 
14.6 Interpretation. All Performance-Based Awards and the provisions hereunder applicable to such Awards shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m). 
14.7 Transition Period. Notwithstanding this Section 14, no restrictions imposed to qualify payments under the Plan as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.162-27(e) shall apply until the expiration of the "reliance period" described in Treas. Reg. §1.162¬27(f)(2). 
15. Withholding. 
15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan prior to making any payments hereunder. 
15.2 Share Withholding. With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units, or upon the achievement of performance goals related to Performance Share Awards, or any other taxable event arising as a result of an Award granted hereunder, Participants may elect, subject to the approval of the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory total tax that could be imposed on the transaction. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing or electronically, and signed or acknowledged electronically by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
16. Certain Terminations of Employment, Hardship and Approved Leaves of Absence. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Participant's termination of employment (including by reason of death, disability or retirement) or in the event of hardship or other special circumstances, the Committee may in its sole discretion take any action that it deems to be equitable under the circumstances or in the best interests of the Company, including, without limitation, waiving or modifying any limitation or requirement with respect to any Award under the Plan. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent the vesting of Awards shall be tolled during any leave of absence, paid or unpaid; provided however, that in the event of military leave, vesting shall toll during any unpaid portion of such leave, provided that, upon a Participant's returning from military leave (under conditions that would entitle him or her to protection upon such return under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act), he or she shall be given vesting credit with respect to the Award to the same extent as would have applied had the Participant continued to provide services to the Company throughout the leave on the same terms as he or she was providing services immediately prior to such leave. Any actions taken by the Committee shall be taken consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, with respect to Performance-Based Awards, Section 162(m) of the Code.

The Committee may from time to time establish one or more sub-plans under the Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable blue sky, securities, and/or tax laws of various jurisdictions. The Committee shall establish such sub-plans by adopting supplements to the Plan containing (a) such limitations as the Committee deems necessary or desirable, and (b) such additional terms and conditions not otherwise inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee shall deem necessary or desirable. All sub-plans adopted by the Committee shall be deemed to be part of the Plan, but each sub-plan shall apply only to Participants within the affected jurisdiction and the Company shall not be required to provide copies of any sub-plans to Participants in any jurisdiction which is not the subject of such sub-plan. 
18. Amendments and Other Matters. 
18.1 Plan Amendments. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or the Committee's authority to grant Awards under the Plan at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments shall be effective without approval of the Company's stockholders if (a) stockholder approval of the amendment is then required pursuant to the Code, the rules of the primary stock exchange or stock market on which the Shares are then traded, applicable U.S. state corporate laws or regulations, applicable U.S. federal laws or regulations, and the applicable laws of any foreign country or jurisdiction where Awards are, or shall be, granted under the Plan, or (b) such amendment would (i) modify Section 18.4, (ii) materially increase benefits accruing to Participants, (iii) increase the aggregate number of Shares issued or issuable under the Plan, (iv) increase any limitation set forth on the number of Shares which may be issued or the aggregate value of Awards or the per-person limits under Section 3 except as provided in Section 12, (v) modify the eligibility requirements for Participants in the Plan, or (vi) reduce the minimum Option Price and Base Price used to determine the Spread as set forth in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, except as provided in Section 18.8, no termination, suspension or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any outstanding Award without the consent of the affected Participant. 
18.2 Award Deferrals. The Committee may permit Participants to elect to defer the issuance of Shares or the settlement of Awards in cash under the Plan pursuant to such rules, procedures or programs as it may establish for purposes of the Plan. However, any Award deferrals which the Committee permits must comply with the provisions of Section 22 and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 
18.3 Conditional Awards. The Committee may condition the grant of any award or combination of Awards under the Plan on the surrender or deferral by the Participant of his or her right to receive a cash bonus or other compensation otherwise payable by the Company or any Affiliate to the Participant, provided that any such grant must comply with the provisions of Section 22 and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 
18.4 Repricing Prohibited. The terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended to reduce the Option Price of outstanding Options or Base Price of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights or cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an Option Price or Base Price that is less than the Option Price or Base Price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, and the Committee may not take any other action that is considered a "repricing" for purposes of the stockholder approval rules of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which Shares are listed or quoted, without stockholder approval, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Committee from taking any action provided for in Section 12 above. 
18.5 No Employment Rights. Nothing in the Plan or an Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries to terminate any Participant's employment or service on the Board or to the Company at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue his employment or service as a director for any specified period of time. Neither an Award nor any benefits arising under the Plan shall constitute an employment contract with the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries and, accordingly, subject to Section 18.1, the Plan and the benefits hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Committee without giving rise to any liability on the part of the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries. 
A-15 
18.6 Tax Qualification. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would prevent any Award that was intended to qualify under particular provisions of the Code from so qualifying, such provision of the Plan shall be null and void with respect to such Award, provided that such provision shall remain in effect with respect to other Awards, and there shall be no further effect on any provision of the Plan. 
18.7 Leave of Absence or Transfer. A transfer between the Company and any Affiliate or between Affiliates, or a leave of absence duly authorized by the Company, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment. Periods of time while on a duly authorized leave of absence shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a Participant has satisfied a Restricted Period or Performance Cycle under an Award. 
18.8 Amendments to Comply with Laws, Regulations or Rules. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of any Participant, the Board may amend the Plan, and the Committee may amend any Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise as it deems necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or such Award Agreement to any present or future law, regulation or rule applicable to the Plan, including, but not limited to, Section 409A of the Code. 
18.9 Tolling. In the event a Participant is prevented from exercising an Option or the Company is unable to settle an Award due to either any trading restrictions applicable to the Company's Shares, the Participant's physical infirmity or administrative error by the Company relied upon and not caused by the Participant, then unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the length of time applicable to any such restriction, condition or event shall toll any exercise period (i) until such restriction lapses, (ii) until the Participant (or his representative) is able to exercise the Award or (iii) until such error is corrected, as applicable. 
18.10 No Duty to Inform Regarding Exercise Rights. Neither the Company, any Affiliate, the Committee nor the Board shall have any duty to inform a Participant of the pending expiration of the period in which a Stock Appreciation right may be exercised or in which an Option may be exercised. 
19. Issuance of Shares; Fractional Shares. 
19.1 Form for Issuing Shares; Legends. Shares may be issued on a certificated or uncertificated basis. Shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer of such Shares. 
19.2 Delivery of Title. The Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under the Plan prior to: (i) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and (ii) completing any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any applicable national or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. 
19.3 Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. 
19.4 Investment Representations. The Committee may require any individual receiving Shares pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent and warrant in writing that the individual is acquiring the Shares for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares, 
19.5 Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue any fractional Shares pursuant to the Plan. The Committee may provide for the elimination of fractions or for the settlement thereof in cash. 
A-16 
20. Limitations Period. Any person who believes he or she is being denied any benefit or right under the Plan may file a written claim with the Committee. Any claim must be delivered to the Committee within forty-five (45) days of the specific event giving rise to the claim. Untimely claims will not be processed and shall be deemed denied. The Committee, or its designated agent, will notify the Participant of its decision in writing as soon as administratively practicable. Claims not responded to by the Committee in writing within ninety (90) days of the date the written claim is delivered to the Committee shall be deemed denied. The Committee's decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons. No lawsuit relating to the Plan may be filed before a written claim is filed with the Committee and is denied or deemed denied, and any lawsuit must be filed within one year of such denial or deemed denial or be forever barred. The venue for any lawsuit shall be Charlotte, North Carolina. 
21. Governing Law. The validity, construction and effect of the Plan and any Award hereunder will be determined in accordance with the State of Delaware except to the extent governed by applicable federal law. 
22. Compliance with Section 409A. 
22.1 In General. The Plan is intended to be administered in a manner consistent with the requirements, where applicable, of Section 409A. For avoidance of doubt, Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights are intended to qualify for the stock rights exemptions from Section 409A. Where reasonably possible and practicable, the Plan shall be administered in a manner to avoid the imposition on Participants of immediate tax recognition and additional taxes pursuant to such Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any liability to any person in the event Section 409A applies to any such Award in a manner that results in adverse tax consequences for the Participant or any of his or her transferees. 
22.2 Elective Deferrals. No elective deferrals or re-deferrals other than in regard to Restricted Stock Units are permitted under the Plan. 
22.3 Applicable Requirements. To the extent any of the Awards granted under the Plan are deemed "deferred compensation" and hence subject to Section 409A, the following rules shall apply to such Awards: 
(a) Mandatory Deferrals. If the Company decides that the payment of compensation under the Plan shall be deferred within the meaning of Section 409A, then, except as provided under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii), on granting of the Award to which such compensation payment relates, the Company shall specify the date(s) at which such compensation will be paid in the Award Agreement. 
(b) Initial Deferral Elections. For Awards of RSUs where the Committee provides the opportunity to elect the timing and form of the payment of the underlying Shares at some future time once any requirements have been satisfied, the Participant must make his or her initial deferral election for such Award in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, i.e., within thirty (30) days of first becoming eligible to receive such award or prior to the start of the year in which the Award is granted to the Participant, in each case pursuant to the requirements of Section 409A and Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2. 
(c) Subsequent Deferral Elections. To the extent the Company or Committee decides to permit compensation subject to Section 409A to be re-deferred pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b), then the following conditions must be met: (i) such election will not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which it is made; (ii) in the case of an election not related to a payment on account of disability, death or an unforeseeable emergency, the payment with respect to which such election is made must be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been paid; and (iii) any election related to a payment at a specified time or pursuant to a fixed schedule (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(a)(4)) must be made not less than 12 months before the date the payment is scheduled to be paid. 
(d) Timing of Payments. Payment(s) of compensation that is subject to Section 409A shall only be made upon an event or at a time set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3, i.e., the Participant's separation 
A-17 
 from service, the Participant's becoming disabled, the Participant's death, at a time or a fixed schedule specified in the Plan or an Award Agreement, a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, or the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency. 
(e) Certain Delayed Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an amount was intended to be paid such that it would have qualified as a short-term deferral under Section 409A and the applicable regulations, then such payment is or could be delayed if the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) are met. 
(f) Acceleration of Payment. Any payment made under the Plan to which Section 409A applies may not be accelerated, except in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4). 
(g) Payments upon a Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent an Award subject to Section 409A shall be deemed to be vested or restrictions lapse, expire or terminate upon the occurrence of a Change in Control and such Change in Control does not constitute a "change in the ownership or effective control" or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A (a)(2)(A)(v), then even though such Award may be deemed to be vested or restrictions lapse, expire or terminate upon the occurrence of the Change in Control or any other provision of the Plan, payment will be made, to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 409A, to the Participant on the earliest of (i) the Participant's "separation from service" with the Company (determined in accordance with Section 409A), (ii) the date payment otherwise would have been made pursuant to the regular payment terms of the Award in the absence of any provisions in the Plan to the contrary (provided such date is permissible under Section 409A) or (iii) the Participant's death. 
(h) Payments to Specified Employees. Payments due to a Participant who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A on account of the Participant's "separation from service" with the Company (determined in accordance with Section 409A) shall be made on the date that is six months after the date of the Participant's separation from service or, if earlier, the Participant's date of death. 
22.4 Deferrals to Preserve Deductibility under Section 162(m). The Committee may postpone the exercising of Awards, the issuance or delivery of Shares under any Award or any action permitted under the Plan to prevent the Company, a Subsidiary or any Affiliate from being denied a Federal income tax deduction with respect to any Award other than an ISO as a result of Section 162(m) in accordance with IRS regulations. In such case, payment of such deferred amounts must be made as soon as reasonably practicable following the first date on which the Company, a Subsidiary and/or Affiliate anticipates or reasonably should anticipate that, if the payment were made on such date, the Company's, Subsidiary's and/or Affiliate's deduction with respect to such payment would no longer be restricted due to the application of Section 162(m). 
22.522.4 Determining "Controlled Group". In order to determine for purposes of Section 409A whether a Participant or eligible individual is employed by a member of the Company's controlled group of corporations under Section 414(b) of the Code (or by a member of a group of trades or businesses under common control with the Company under Section 414(c) of the Code) and, therefore, whether the Shares that are or have been purchased by or awarded under the Plan to the Participant are shares of "service recipient" stock within the meaning of Section 409A, a Participant or eligible employee of Premier Healthcare Alliance, L.P. shall be considered employed by the Company's controlled group (or by a member of a group of trades or businesses under common control with the Company, as applicable). 
23. Transferability. 
23.1 Transfer Restrictions. Except as provided in Sections 23.2 and 23.4, no Award granted under the Plan shall be transferable by a Participant other than upon death by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable during a Participant's lifetime only by the Participant 
A-18 
 or, in the event of the Participant's legal incapacity, by his guardian or legal representative acting in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the Participant under state law. Any attempt to transfer an Award in violation of the Plan shall render such Award null and void. 
23.2 Limited Transfer Rights. The Committee may expressly provide in an Award Agreement that a Participant may transfer such Award (other than an Incentive Stock Option), in whole or in part, to a Family Member, a trust for the exclusive benefit of the Participant and Family Members, a partnership or other entity in which all the beneficial owners are the Participant and Family Members, or any other entity affiliated with the Participant that may be approved by the Committee. Subsequent transfers of Awards shall be prohibited except in accordance with this Section 23.2. All terms and conditions of the Award, including provisions relating to the termination of the Participant's covered employment or service shall continue to apply following a transfer made in accordance with this Section 23.2. 
23.3 Additional Restrictions on Transfer. Any Award made under the Plan may provide that all or any part of the Shares that are to be issued or transferred by the Company upon exercise, vesting or settlement shall be subject to further restrictions upon transfer. 
23.4 Domestic Relations Orders. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 23, any Award made under the Plan may be transferred as necessary to fulfill any domestic relations order as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code. 
24. Forfeiture, Recoupment and Clawback. Without limiting in any way the generality of the Committee's power to specify any terms and conditions of an Award consistent with law, and for greater clarity, the Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award, including any payment of Shares received upon exercise or in satisfaction of an Award under the Plan shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions, without limit as to time. Such events shall include, but not be limited to, failure to accept the terms of the Award Agreement, termination of service under certain or all circumstances, violation of material Company policies, material misstatement of financial or other material information about the Company, fraud, misconduct, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, nonsolicitation, noninterference, corporate property protection, or other agreements that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that the Committee determines is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company and its Affiliates, including facts and circumstances discovered after termination of service. Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to any compensation recovery policy or minimum stock holding period requirement as may be adopted or amended by the Company from time to time. All Awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by a Participant upon any receipt or exercise of any Award or upon the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award) shall be subject to the provisions of any clawback policy implemented by the Company, including, without limitation, any clawback policy adopted to comply with the requirements of applicable law, including without limitation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules promulgated thereunder, to the extent set forth in such clawback policy and/or in the applicable Award Agreement. 
25. No Constraint on Corporate Action. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to: (i) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company's or an Affiliate's or a Subsidiary's right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or, (ii) limit the right or power of the Company or an Affiliate or a Subsidiary to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate. 
26. Effect of Disposition of Facility or Operating Unit. If the Company or any of its Affiliates closes or disposes of the facility at which a Participant is located or the Company or any of its Affiliates diminish or eliminate ownership interests in any operating unit of the Company or any of its Affiliates so that such operating unit ceases to be majority owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates then, with respect to Awards held by 
A-19 
 Participants who, subsequent to such event, will not be Employees, the Committee may, to the extent consistent with Section 409A (if applicable), take any of the actions described in Section 13.1 with respect to a Change in Control. If the Committee takes no special action with respect to any disposition of a facility or an operating unit, then the Participant shall be deemed to have terminated his or her employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement and the other terms and conditions of the Plan shall control. 
27. Indemnification. Subject to requirements of applicable state law, each individual who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a Committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 34, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him, provided he shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he undertakes to handle and defend it on his own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of his own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such individuals may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 
28. Nonexclusivity of the Plan. The adoption of the Plan shall not be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or Committee to adopt such other compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable for any Participant. 
29. Miscellaneous. 
29.1 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural. 
29.2 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
29.3 Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. 
29.4 Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 
29.5 Payment Following a Participant's Death. Any remaining vested rights or benefits under the Plan upon a Participant's death shall be paid or provided to the Participant's legal spouse or, if no such spouse survives the Participant, to the Participant's estate. 
29.6 Rights as a Shareholder. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the Participant becomes the record holder of such Shares.

Appendix B 
Fiscal Year 2018 Performance – GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations 
To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our liquidity, we supplement the financial results we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") with certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not determined in accordance with GAAP ("Non-GAAP"). Our management regularly uses our supplemental Non-GAAP financial measures to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operational decisions.    To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we urge you to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures below, as well as those included in our 2018 Form 10-K. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2018 Form 10-K, and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share are susceptible to varying calculations, such Non-GAAP financial measures, as presented herein and in our 2018 Form 10-K, may differ from, and may therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
In the accompanying proxy statement, particularly under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we use the following Non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share. 
We define EBITDA as net income before interest and investment income, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before merger and acquisition related expenses and non-recurring, non-cash or non-operating items and including equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates. For all Non-GAAP financial measures, we consider non-recurring items to be income or expenses and other items that have not been earned or incurred within the prior two years and are not expected to recur within the next two years. Such items include certain strategic and financial restructuring expenses. Non-operating items include gains or losses on the disposal of assets and interest and investment income or expense. 
We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to us (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the impact of adjustment of redeemable limited partners' capital to redemption amount, (iii) excluding the effect of non-recurring and non-cash items, (iv) assuming the exchange of all the Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in Premier LP and (v) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on Non-GAAP fully distributed net income before income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate. We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share as Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares. 
Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements and is considered to be an indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA allows us to assess our performance without regard to financing methods and capital structure and without the impact of other matters that we do not consider indicative of the operating performance of our business. 
We use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA assists our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes the impact of earnings elements attributable to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) and certain items outside the control of our management team, e.g., taxes, as well as other non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based 
B-1 
 compensation) and non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses) from our operating results. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our net income and earnings per share on a consistent basis from period to period because these measures remove non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation) and non-recurring items (such as strategic and financial restructuring expenses), and eliminate the variability of non-controlling interest that results from member owner exchanges of Class B common units into shares of Class A common stock. 
Despite the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our business, determining compliance with certain financial covenants in our credit facility, measuring and determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance relative to our competitors, these Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of our performance derived in accordance with GAAP. 
Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include that they do not reflect: our capital expenditures or our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; the interest expense or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit facility; income tax payments we are required to make; and any cash requirements for replacements of assets being depreciated or amortized. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, are not measures of liquidity under GAAP, or otherwise, and are not alternatives to cash flows from operating activities. Some of the limitations of Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income and Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share are that they do not reflect income tax expense or income tax payments we are required to make and they are not measures of profitability under GAAP. 
Non-recurring and non-cash items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income consist of stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses, remeasurement of TRA liabilities, ERP implementation expenses, acquisition related adjustment—revenue, remeasurement gain attributable to acquisition of Innovatix, LLC, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, loss on FFF put and call rights, impairment on investments and other expense. More information about certain of the more significant items follows below. 
Stock-based compensation 
In addition to non-cash employee stock-based compensation expense, this item includes non-cash stock purchase plan expense of $0.4 million during both of the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 
Remeasurement of TRA liabilities 
We record TRA liabilities based on 85% of the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive, generally over a 15-year period, which are attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners made concurrently with the IPO and subsequent exchanges by member owners of Class B common units into Class A common stock or cash. Tax payments made under the TRA will be made to the member owners as we realize tax benefits. Determining the estimated amount of tax savings we expect to receive requires judgment as deductibility of goodwill amortization expense is not assured and the estimate of tax savings is dependent upon the actual realization of the tax benefit and the tax rates in effect at that time. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are the result of a change in tax accounting method, including the impacts of the TCJA, are recorded as a component of other operating income or selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in estimated TRA liabilities that are related to new basis changes as a result of the exchange of Class B common units for a like number of shares of Class A common stock or as a result of departed member owners are recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. 
B-2 
The adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to the 14% decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, which occurred as a result of the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017. The adjustment to TRA liabilities for the year ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributable to the increase in income apportioned to California and a 1.5% decrease in the North Carolina state income tax rate. 
Acquisition related adjustment – revenue 
Upon acquiring Innovatix, LLC and Essensa Ventures LLC, we recorded a net $17.4 million purchase accounting adjustment to Adjusted EBITDA during the year ended June 30, 2017 that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to member purchases that occurred prior to December 2, 2016, but were reported to us subsequent to that date through June 30, 2017. Under our revenue recognition accounting policy, which is in accordance with GAAP, these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us; however, the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases prior to the acquisition date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable (as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us) and record any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability. The purchase accounting adjustment amounted to an estimated $21.2 million of accounts receivable relating to these administrative fees and an estimated $3.8 million for the related revenue share obligation through June 30, 2017. 
This item also includes non-cash adjustments to deferred revenue of acquired entities of $0.3 million and $0.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Business combination accounting rules require us to record a deferred revenue liability at our fair value only if the acquired deferred revenue represents a legal performance obligation assumed by the acquirer. The fair value is based on direct and indirect incremental costs of providing the services plus a normal profit margin. Generally, this results in a reduction to the purchased deferred revenue balance, which was based on upfront software license update fees and product support contracts assumed in connection with acquisitions. Because these support contracts are typically one year in duration, our GAAP revenues for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition of a business do not reflect the full amount of support revenues on these assumed support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired entity. The Non-GAAP adjustment to software license update fees and product support revenues is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of such revenues. 
Strategic and financial restructuring expenses 
This item represents legal, accounting and other expenses directly related to strategic and financial restructuring activities. 
Loss on FFF put and call rights 
Pursuant to a shareholders' agreement entered into in connection with our equity investment in FFF Enterprises, Inc. ("FFF") on July 26, 2016, which shareholders' agreement was amended and restated November 22, 2017, the majority shareholder of FFF holds a put right that provides such shareholder the right to require us to purchase (i) up to 50% of its interest in FFF, which is exercisable beginning on July 26, 2020, the fourth anniversary of the investment closing date, and (ii) all or a portion of its remaining interest in FFF on or after December 31, 2020. Any such required purchases are to be made at a per share price equal to FFF's EBITDA over the twelve calendar months prior to the purchase date multiplied by a market adjusted multiple, adjusted for any outstanding debt and cash and cash equivalents ("Equity Value per Share"). In addition, the amended and restated shareholders' agreement provides us with a call right requiring the majority shareholder to sell its remaining interest in FFF to us, which is exercisable at any time within the later of 180 calendar days after the date of a Key Man Event (generally defined in the amended and restated shareholders' agreement as the resignation, termination for cause, death or disability of the majority shareholder) or 30 calendar days after December 31, 2020. In the event that the FFF put or call rights are exercised, the purchase price for the additional interest in FFF will be at a per share price equal to the Equity Value per Share. 
B-3 
The fair values of the FFF put and call rights were determined based on the Equity Value per Share calculation using unobservable inputs, which included the estimated FFF put and call rights' expiration dates, the forecast of FFF's EBITDA over the option period, forecasted movements in the overall market and the likelihood of a Key Man Event. Significant changes to the Equity Value per Share resulting from changes in the unobservable inputs could have a significant impact on the fair values of the FFF put and call rights. For fiscal year 2018, the loss on the FFF put and call rights of $22,036 resulted from the decrease in the fair value of the call right asset and put right liability of ($4,045) and ($17,991), respectively.    For fiscal year 2017, the loss on the FFF put and call rights of $3,395 resulted from the (decrease)/increase in the fair value of the call right asset and put right liability of ($5,706) and $1,771, respectively.
Impairment on investments 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, we determined that we were unlikely to recover our investment in PharmaPoint, LLC, and as a result recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $4.0 million. We account for our investment in PharmaPoint using the equity method of accounting and include the investment as part of the Supply Chain Services segment. 
Adjustment to Non-GAAP Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share to Neutralize the Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
We have removed the financial related impact ($0.24 per share in fiscal year 2018) resulting from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted through the TCJA for purposes of calculating Non-GAAP Adjusted Fully Distributed Earnings per Share when determining performance levels associated with performance share awards that vested on June 30, 2018.
