This proxy statement and our annual report are available electronically at http://www.proxydocs.com/EVOK.
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
Why did you send me this proxy statement? 
We sent you this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card because our board of directors is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. This proxy statement summarizes information related to your vote at the annual meeting. All stockholders who find it convenient to do so are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting in person. However, you do not need to attend the meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card. 
We intend to begin mailing this proxy statement, the attached notice of annual meeting and the enclosed proxy card on or about March 21, 2019 to all stockholders of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Only stockholders who owned our common stock on March 4, 2019 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. On this record date, there were 17,427,533 shares of our common stock outstanding. Common stock is our only class of stock entitled to vote. 
What am I voting on? 
There are four proposals scheduled for a vote:

[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owners: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than directly from us. Simply complete and mail the proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted. You may be eligible to vote your shares electronically over the Internet or by telephone. A large number of banks and brokerage firms offer Internet and telephone voting. If your bank or brokerage firm does not offer Internet or telephone voting information, please complete and return your proxy card in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided. To vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker or bank included with these proxy materials, or contact your broker or bank to request a proxy form. 
May I revoke my proxy? 
If you give us your proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised. You may revoke your proxy in any one of the three following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• you may send in another signed proxy with a later date,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• you may notify our corporate secretary, Matthew J. D'Onofrio, in writing before the annual meeting that you have revoked your proxy, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• you may vote in person at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence at the annual meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing a majority of our outstanding common stock as of March 4, 2019, or 8,713,767 shares, constitutes a quorum at the meeting, permitting us to conduct our business. 
What vote is required to approve each proposal? 
Proposal 1: Election of Directors. The two nominees who receive the most "For" votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be elected. Only votes "For" or "Withheld" will affect the outcome.  Proposal 2: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP must receive "For" votes from the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. 
Proposal 3: Approval of the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers. The approval of the compensation of the named executive officers must receive "For" votes from the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. 
Proposal 4: Frequency of Stockholder Vote on Executive Compensation. The alternative which receives the most "For" votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be the stockholders' recommendation, on an advisory basis, of the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation.
Voting results will be tabulated and certified by Mediant Communications LLC.
What is the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes? 
Shares of common stock held by persons attending the annual meeting but not voting, and shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions as to a particular proposal, will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Abstentions are treated as shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, so abstaining has the same effect as a negative vote for purposes of determining whether our stockholders have ratified the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, and whether our stockholders have approved the compensation of the named executive officers. However, because the election of directors and advisory vote on the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation are determined by a plurality of votes cast, abstentions will not be counted in determining the outcome of such proposals.  
Shares represented by proxies that reflect a "broker non-vote" will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not received instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares for certain non-routine matters. With regard to the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers and the advisory vote regarding the frequency of the stockholder vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers, broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. However, ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP is considered a routine matter on which a broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote. As a result, broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of this proposal. 
Who is paying the costs of soliciting these proxies? 
We will pay all of the costs of soliciting these proxies. Our directors, officers and other employees may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, fax or email. We will not pay our directors, officers or other employees any additional compensation for these services. We will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward these proxy materials to their principals and to obtain authority to execute proxies. We will then reimburse them for their expenses. Our costs for forwarding proxy materials will not be significant.  
How do I obtain an Annual Report on Form 10-K? 
If you would like a copy of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that we filed with the SEC, we will send you one without charge. Please write to: 
Evoke Pharma, Inc.
420 Stevens Avenue, Suite 370
Solana Beach, CA 92075 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
All of our SEC filings are also available free of charge in the investor relations section of our website at www.evokepharma.com. 
How can I find out the results of the voting at the annual meeting? 
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting. Final voting results will be published in our current report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the annual meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an additional Form 8-K to publish the final results.  PROPOSAL 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with one class of our directors standing for election each year, generally for a three-year term. The current term of the company's Class III directors, Malcolm R. Hill and Ann D. Rhoads, will expire at the 2019 annual meeting. 
The nominees for Class III director for election at the 2019 annual meeting are Malcolm R. Hill and Ann D. Rhoads.  If both of Mr. Hill and Ms. Rhoads are elected at the 2019 annual meeting, such individuals will be elected to serve for a term of three years that will expire at our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and until such individual's successor is elected and qualified. 
If no contrary indication is made, proxies in the accompanying form will be voted for the nominees, or in the event that any nominee is not a candidate or is unable to serve as a director at the time of the election (which is not currently expected), for any nominee who is designated by our board of directors to fill the vacancy.  Mr. Hill and Ms. Rhoads are currently members of our board of directors.

Board Leadership Structure 
Our board of directors is currently led by its chairman, Cam L. Garner. Our board of directors recognizes that it is important to determine an optimal board leadership structure to ensure the independent oversight of management as the company continues to grow. We separate the roles of chief executive officer and chairman of the board in recognition of the differences between the two roles. The chief executive officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the company and the day-to-day leadership and performance of the company, while the chairman of the board of directors provides guidance to the chief executive officer and presides over meetings of the full board of directors. We believe that this separation of responsibilities provides a balanced approach to managing the board of directors and overseeing the company. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of the company's risk management processes and, either as a whole or through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our business and the steps we take to manage them. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from board committees and members of senior management to enable our board to understand the company's risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, strategic and reputational risk. 
The audit committee reviews information regarding liquidity and operations, and oversees our management of financial risks. Periodically, the audit committee reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management, loss prevention and  regulatory compliance. Oversight by the audit committee includes direct communication with our external auditors, and discussions with management regarding significant risk exposures and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control such exposures. The compensation committee is responsible for assessing whether any of our compensation policies or programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The nominating and corporate governance committee manages risks associated with the independence of the board, corporate disclosure practices, and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks. Matters of significant strategic risk are considered by our board as a whole. 
Board of Directors Meetings
During 2018, our board of directors met five times. In that year, each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings held during such director's term of service by the board of directors and each committee of the board of directors on which such director served, except for Dr. Hill, who attended 67% of such meetings.
Committees of the Board of Directors 
We have three standing committees: the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee. Each of these committees has a written charter approved by our board of directors. A copy of each charter can be found under the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.evokepharma.com.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for making recommendations to our board of directors regarding candidates for directorships and the size and composition of our board of directors. In addition, the nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for overseeing our corporate governance policies and reporting and making recommendations to our board of directors concerning governance matters.  
The members of our nominating and corporate governance committee are Drs. Brady, Hill and Widder. Dr. Brady serves as the chairman of the committee. Our board has determined that each of Drs.

The nominating and corporate governance committee is governed by a written charter that is available to stockholders on our website at www.evokepharma.com. 
Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
The audit committee oversees the company's financial reporting process on behalf of our board of directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the audit committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the company's annual report with management, including a discussion of any significant changes in the selection or application of accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements and the effect of any new accounting initiatives. 
We have reviewed and discussed with BDO USA, LLP our audited financial statements. We discussed with BDO USA, LLP the overall scope and plans of their audits. We met with BDO USA, LLP, with and without management present, to discuss results of its examinations, and the overall quality of the company's financial reporting.
We have reviewed and discussed with BDO USA, LLP matters required to be discussed pursuant to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 1301 "Communications with Audit Committees." We have received from BDO USA, LLP the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding BDO USA, LLP's communications with the audit committee concerning independence. We have discussed with BDO USA, LLP matters relating to its independence, including a review of both audit and non-audit fees, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with BDO USA, LLP's independence.  The audit committee is not employed by the company, nor does it provide any expert assurance or professional certification regarding the company's financial statements.  The audit committee relies, without independent verification, on the accuracy and integrity of the information provided and representations made by management and the company's independent registered public accounting firm.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee has recommended to the company's board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018. The audit committee and the company's board of directors also have recommended, subject to stockholder approval, the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
This report of the audit committee is not "soliciting material," shall not be deemed "filed" with the SEC and shall not be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.  The foregoing report has been furnished by the audit committee. 
Respectfully submitted,
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
Ann D. Rhoads (Chairperson)
Scott L. Glenn
Kenneth J. Widder, M.D.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Mr. Garner, Dr. Brady and Ms. Rhoads served on our compensation committee during 2018. None of the members of our compensation committee has ever been one of our officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee. 
Director Nomination Process 
Director Qualifications
In evaluating director nominees, the nominating and corporate governance committee will consider, among other things, the following factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal and professional integrity, ethics and values; 
• experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a publicly-held company; 
• development or commercialization experience in large pharmaceutical companies; 
• experience as a board member or executive officer of another publicly-held company; 
• strong finance experience; 
• diversity of expertise and experience in substantive matters pertaining to our business relative to other board members; 
• diversity of background and perspective, including with respect to age, gender, race, place of residence and specialized experience; 
• conflicts of interest; and 
• practical and mature business judgment. 
[END TABLE]
The nominating and corporate governance committee's goal is to assemble a board of directors that brings to the company a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional experience. Moreover, the nominating and corporate governance committee believes that the background and qualifications of the board of directors, considered as a group, should provide a significant mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow the board of directors to fulfill its responsibilities. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability or any other basis proscribed by law.
Other than the foregoing criteria for director nominees, the nominating and corporate governance committee has not adopted a formal policy with respect to a fixed set of specific minimum qualifications for its candidates for membership on the board of directors. The nominating and corporate governance committee may consider such other facts, including, without limitation, diversity, as it may deem are in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee does, however, believe it is appropriate for at least one, and, preferably, several, members of our board of directors to meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules, and that a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent as required under the Nasdaq qualification standards. The nominating and corporate governance committee also believes it is appropriate for our President and Chief Executive Officer to serve as a member of our board of directors. Our directors' performance and qualification criteria are reviewed annually by the nominating and corporate governance committee.
Identification and Evaluation of Nominees for Directors 
The nominating and corporate governance committee identifies nominees for director by first evaluating the current members of our board of directors willing to continue in service. Current members with qualifications and skills that are consistent with the nominating and corporate governance committee's criteria for board of directors service and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of our board of directors with that of obtaining a new perspective or expertise.  If any member of our board of directors does not wish to continue in service or if our board of directors decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the nominating and corporate governance committee may identify the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above, in which case, the nominating and corporate governance committee would generally poll our board of directors and members of management for their recommendations. The nominating and corporate governance committee may also review the composition and qualification of the boards of directors of our competitors, and may seek input from industry experts or analysts. The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews the qualifications, experience and background of the candidates. Final candidates are interviewed by the members of the nominating and corporate governance committee and by certain of our other independent directors and executive management. In making its determinations, the nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates each individual in the context of our board of directors as a whole, with the objective of assembling a group that can best contribute to the success of our company and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment. After review and deliberation of all feedback and data, the nominating and corporate governance committee makes its recommendation to our board of directors. To date, the nominating and corporate governance committee has not utilized third-party search firms to identify director candidates. The nominating and corporate governance committee may in the future choose to do so in those situations where particular qualifications are required or where existing contacts are not sufficient to identify an appropriate candidate. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates nominees recommended by stockholders in the same manner as it evaluates other nominees. We have not received director candidate recommendations from our stockholders and do not have a formal policy regarding consideration of such recommendations. However, any recommendations received from stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner that potential nominees suggested by board members, management or other parties are evaluated. We do not intend to treat stockholder recommendations in any manner different from other recommendations. 
Under our amended and restated bylaws, stockholders wishing to suggest a candidate for director should write to our corporate secretary and provide such information about the stockholder and the proposed candidate as is set forth in our amended and restated bylaws and as would be required by SEC rules to be included in a proxy statement. In addition, the stockholder must include the consent of the candidate and describe any arrangements or undertakings between the stockholder and the candidate regarding the nomination. In order to give the nominating and corporate governance committee sufficient time to evaluate a recommended candidate and/or include the candidate in our proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting, the recommendation should be received by our corporate secretary at our principal executive offices in accordance with our procedures detailed in the section below entitled "Stockholder Proposals." 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Although our company does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of our board of directors at our annual meeting, we encourage all of our directors to attend. Six of the seven board members attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.
Communications with our Board of Directors 
Stockholders seeking to communicate with our board of directors should submit their written comments to our corporate secretary at Evoke Pharma, Inc., 420 Stevens Avenue, Suite 370, Solana Beach, California 92075. The corporate secretary will forward such communications to each member of our board of directors; provided that, if in the opinion of our corporate secretary it would be inappropriate to send a particular stockholder communication to a specific director, such communication will only be sent to the remaining directors (subject to the remaining directors concurring with such opinion).

Our company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter are available, free of charge, on our website at www.evokepharma.com. Please note, however, that the information contained on the website is not incorporated by reference in, or considered part of, this proxy statement.

Votes withheld from any nominee, abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted only for purposes of determining a quorum.

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF MALCOLM R. HILL AND ANN D. RHOADS. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS YOU SPECIFY OTHERWISE ON YOUR PROXY CARD. 
PROPOSAL 2RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
The audit committee has selected BDO USA, LLP as the company's independent registered public accountants for the year ending December 31, 2019 and has further directed that management submit the selection of independent registered public accountants for ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. BDO USA, LLP has audited the company's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2018. Representatives of BDO USA, LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Stockholder ratification of the selection of BDO USA, LLP as the company's independent registered public accountants is not required by Delaware law, the company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or the company's amended and restated bylaws. However, the audit committee is submitting the selection of BDO USA, LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the audit committee will reconsider whether to retain the firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent registered public accountants at any time during the year if the audit committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.  The following table represents aggregate fees billed to us for services related to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, by BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm:

 (3)  Tax Fees consist of fees for professional services, including tax consulting and compliance performed by BDO USA, LLP.  There were no such fees incurred during 2018 or 2017.  
[END TABLE]
The audit committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of BDO USA, LLP, and has concluded that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining the independence of our auditors. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
Our audit committee has established a policy that all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm will be pre-approved by the audit committee, and all such services were pre-approved in accordance with this policy during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The audit committee considers whether the provision of each non-audit service is compatible with maintaining the independence of our auditors. Pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. Our independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the audit committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. 
Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting will be required to ratify the selection of BDO USA, LLP. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes cast on this proposal and will have the same effect as negative votes. The approval of Proposal 2 is a routine proposal on which a broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote. Accordingly, no broker non-votes will likely result from this proposal. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE TO RATIFY THE SELECTION OF BDO USA, LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019. PROXIES SOLICITED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY OTHERWISE ON THEIR PROXY CARDS. 
PROPOSAL 3APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, our stockholders are entitled to vote at the annual meeting to provide advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the stockholder vote on executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors. 
Although the vote is non-binding, our compensation committee and board of directors value the opinions of the stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. We urge stockholders to read the Executive Compensation and Other Information section of this proxy statement, which describes in detail our executive compensation.  We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask that our stockholders vote "FOR" the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that Evoke Pharma, Inc.'s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in Evoke Pharma, Inc.'s Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Executive Compensation and Other Information, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure." 
Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting will be required to approve the advisory vote regarding the compensation of the named executive officers. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes cast on this proposal and will have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal as brokers or other nominees are not entitled to vote on such proposals in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC.
PROPOSAL 4FREQUENCY OF STOCKHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, our stockholders are entitled to vote at the annual meeting regarding whether the stockholder vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act (and as described in proposal 3 of this proxy statement), should occur every one, two or three years. Under the rules issued by the SEC, stockholders shall also have the option to abstain from voting on the matter. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the stockholder vote on the frequency of the stockholder vote to approve executive compensation is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding on us or our board of directors. 
Although the vote is non-binding, our compensation committee and board of directors value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when determining the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation. 
Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
If a quorum is present and voting at the annual meeting, the alternative receiving the highest number of votes—every one year, every two years or every three years—will be the stockholders' recommendation, on an advisory basis, of the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted only for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal as brokers or other nominees are not entitled to vote on such proposal in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR EVERY THREE YEARS REGARDING THE FREQUENCY OF THE STOCKHOLDER VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 14A(A)(2) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. PLEASE NOTE: STOCKHOLDERS ARE NOT VOTING TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OUR BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL 4. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 4, 2019 by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of our named executive officers;  
• each of our directors;  
• all of our executive officers and directors as a group; and  
• each person or group of affiliated persons known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
The number of shares beneficially owned by each stockholder is determined under rules issued by the SEC. Under these rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which a person has sole or shared voting power or investment power. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 17,427,533 shares of common stock outstanding on March 4, 2019. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options, warrants or other rights held by such person that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days of March 4, 2019 are considered outstanding, although these shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed below is c/o Evoke Pharma, Inc., 420 Stevens Avenue, Suite 370, Solana Beach, CA 92075.  We believe, based on information provided to us that each of the stockholders listed below has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by the stockholder unless noted otherwise, subject to community property laws where applicable.

 Pursuant to each of the employment agreements, if we terminate such officer's employment without cause (as defined below), such officer resigns for good reason (as defined below) or such officer's employment is terminated as a result of his or her death or following his or her permanent disability, the executive officer or his or her estate, as applicable, is entitled to the following payments and benefits: (1) fully earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination at the rate then in effect, plus all other amounts under any compensation plan or practice to which he or she is entitled; (2) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to 12 months of his base salary as in effect immediately prior to the date of termination; (3) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to his or her bonus (as defined below) for the year in which the termination of his employment occurs, prorated for the period of his service during such year, provided that the officer shall not be entitled to receive such amount in the event that his termination results from his discharge by us without cause prior to a change in control (as defined below); (4) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the cost of the continuation of health benefits for a period of 12 months following date of termination; (5) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the cost of his life insurance premiums for a period of 12 months following the date of termination; (6) solely in the event of the officer's termination by us without cause or by the officer for good reason, a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to $15,000 for outplacement service; and (7) the automatic acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of outstanding unvested stock awards as to the number of stock awards that would have vested over the 12-month period following termination had such executive officer remained continuously employed by us during such period.

Employment Agreement with Dr. Carlson
We have also entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Carlson. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Dr. Carlson agrees to devote 80% of her productive time and efforts to the performance of her duties as Chief Medical Officer. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Dr. Carlson's base salary is subject to review each year at the sole discretion of the compensation committee. Dr. Carlson is also eligible to earn an annual cash performance bonus under the company's bonus plan or plans applicable to senior executives. The annual cash performance bonus payable is based on the achievement of individual and/or Company performance goals to be determined in good faith by the compensation committee. The company also pays Dr. Carlson a taxable monthly payment equal to the monthly premium Dr. Carlson pays for healthcare coverage under Medicare, in an amount not to exceed $2,000 per month. 
Pursuant to the employment agreement, if we terminate Dr. Carlson's employment without cause (as defined below) or Dr. Carlson resigns for good reason (as defined below), Dr. Carlson is entitled to the following payments and benefits: (1) fully earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination at the rate then in effect, plus all other amounts under any compensation plan or practice to which she is entitled; (2) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to her monthly base salary as in effect immediately prior to the date of termination for a period of nine months; (3) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to her bonus for the year in which the termination of her employment occurs, prorated for the period of her service during such year, provided that Dr. Carlson shall not be entitled to receive such amount in the event that her termination results from her discharge by the company without cause prior to a change in control (as defined below); and (4) a taxable monthly payment in an amount equal to her monthly healthcare coverage costs under Medicare as in effect immediately prior to the date of termination, in an amount not to exceed $2,000 per month, for a period of nine months.

For purposes of the employment agreements with the named executive officers, "good reason" generally means (1) other than for Dr. Carlson, a change in the executive officer's status, position or responsibilities that, in the executive officer's reasonable judgment, represents a substantial and material reduction in the status, position or responsibilities as in effect  immediately prior thereto; the assignment to the executive officer of any duties or responsibilities that, in the executive officer's reasonable judgment, are materially inconsistent with such status, position or responsibilities; or any removal of the executive officer from or failure to reappoint or reelect the executive officer to any of such positions, except in connection with the termination of the executive officer's employment for cause (as defined above), as a result of his or her permanent disability or death, or by the executive officer other than for good reason; (2) with respect to Dr. Carlson, a material diminution in her authority, duties or responsibilities; (3) a material reduction in the executive officer's annual base salary, except in connection with a general reduction in the compensation of our or any successor's or affiliate's personnel with similar status and responsibilities; (4) our or any successor's or affiliate's requirement the executive officer (without the executive officer's consent) be based at any place outside a 50-mile radius of his or her placement of employment as of the effective date of the employment agreement, except for reasonably required travel for our or any successor's or affiliate's business that is not materially greater than such travel requirements prior to the effective date of the employment agreement; (5) any material breach by us or any successor or affiliate of obligations to the executive officer under the employment agreement; (6) other than for Dr. Carlson, any purported termination of the executive officer's employment or service relationship for cause (as defined above) by us or any successor or affiliate that is not in accordance with the definition of cause; or (7) other than for Dr. Carlson, a change in control (as defined below).

Executive Compensation Components
Independent Compensation Consultant and Comparable Company Compensation Information
During 2018, our compensation committee retained Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC as its independent compensation consultant.  Marsh & McLennan assisted the compensation committee in confirming a peer group of companies to be used in the compensation setting process.  After review and consultation with Marsh & McLennan, the compensation committee determined that Marsh & McLennan is independent and there was no conflict of interest resulting from retaining Marsh & McLennan during fiscal year 2018. In reaching these conclusions, the compensation committee considered the factors set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1 and Nasdaq listing standards.
For purposes of determining 2019 executive compensation, a peer group of 20 life sciences companies in similar phases of development as us with the following characteristics was selected based on the following parameters and not on the basis of executive compensation levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market capitalization less than $500 million.  
• Revenues less than $50 million.  
• Employee size less than 100 employees.  
• Peer group companies were located nationally.  
[END TABLE]
 The 2018 peer group consisted of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 AcelRX Pharmaceuticals  Geron 
 Agile Therapeutics  MEI Pharma 
 Aldeyra Therapeutics  Northwest Biotherapeutics 
 ArQule  Onconova Therapeutics 
 Cara Therapeutics  Pain Therapeutics 
 Celsion  Paratek Pharmaceuticals 
 Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals  Sesen Bio (fka Bevin Bio) 
 Cytokinetics  Syndax Pharmaceuticals 
 CytRx  Verastem 
 Edge Therapeutics  Vical 
[END TABLE]
While our compensation committee reviewed the foregoing comparable company data in connection with its determinations of the 2019 base salaries, target bonuses and equity awards for our named executive officers, our committee did not attempt to set those compensation levels or awards at a certain target percentile with respect to the comparable company data or otherwise rely entirely on that data to determine named executive officer compensation. Instead, as described above and consistent with past practice, the compensation committee members relied on their judgment and experience in setting those compensation levels and making those awards. 
We expect that the compensation committee will continue to review comparable company data in connection with setting the compensation we offer our named executive officers to help ensure that our compensation programs are competitive and fair. 
Base Salaries
In general, base salaries for our named executive officers are initially established through arm's length negotiation at the time the executive is hired, taking into account such executive's qualifications, experience and prior salary. Base salaries of our named executive officers are approved and reviewed annually by our compensation committee and adjustments to base salaries are based on the scope of an executive's responsibilities, individual contribution, prior experience and sustained performance. Decisions regarding salary increases may take into account an executive officer's current salary, equity ownership, and the amounts paid to an executive officer's peers inside our company by conducting an internal analysis, which compares the pay of an executive officer to other members of the management team. Base salaries are also reviewed in the case of promotions or other significant changes in responsibility. Base salaries are not automatically increased if the board of directors and compensation committee believe that other elements of the named executive officer's compensation are more appropriate in light of our stated objectives. This strategy is consistent with our intent of offering compensation that is both cost-effective, competitive and contingent on the achievement of performance objectives. 
The actual base salaries paid to all of our named executive officers for 2018 are set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" above. 
In February 2018, our compensation committee approved base salary increases for 2018 for Messrs. Gonyer and D'Onofrio and Dr. Carlson to $450,000, $357,000 and $337,000, respectively.  These base salary increases represented adjustments of approximately 5.9%, 3.5% and 3.7%, respectively.
In February 2019, our compensation committee approved base salary increases for 2019 for Messrs. Gonyer and D'Onofrio and Dr. Carlson to $475,000, $372,000, and $352,000, respectively.  These base salary increases represented adjustments of approximately 5.6%, 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively.
The base salaries of our named executive officers continue to be below the median level of similarly-situated executives for our peer group of companies.
Annual Cash Performance Bonuses
Each named executive officer is also eligible for a performance bonus based upon the achievement of certain corporate performance goals and objectives approved by our compensation committee and board of directors. 
Bonuses are set based on a percentage of the executive's base salary as of the end of the bonus year and are expected to be paid out in the first quarter of the following year. The target levels for 2018 executive bonuses were as follows: 50% for our Chief Executive Officer, 45% for our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, and 40% for our Chief Medical Officer. The executive bonuses are 100% based on the achievement of corporate objectives that are set each year by the board of directors and the compensation committee.  All final bonus payments to our named executive officers are determined by our compensation committee. The actual bonuses awarded in any year, if any, may be more or less than the target, depending on individual performance and the achievement of corporate objectives and may also vary based on other factors at the discretion of the compensation committee. For 2018, the corporate performance objectives for our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer were related to clinical and regulatory development, commercial development, and corporate financial objectives. These performance objectives and areas of emphasis were used as a guide by the compensation committee and board of directors in determining overall corporate performance for these executives as they represented those areas in which they were expected to focus their efforts during the year.  Both qualitative and quantitative guidelines were established for purposes of evaluating performance relating to these corporate objectives during 2018.  In coming to its final determination regarding the overall corporate achievement for 2018, our compensation committee noted our clinical and regulatory development milestones related to Gimoti, including (1) submission of the New Drug Application ("NDA") to FDA; (2) acceptance of the NDA by FDA; and (3) maintenance of cash reserves to continue operations and prepare for commercial activities and strategic collaboration.  The compensation committee also considered our progress towards the commencement of commercial activities.  In addition, the compensation committee considered our cash management efforts which included managing expenditures within budgeted levels. As a result of these achievements, the compensation committee determined to award a corporate achievement level of 105% for our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
For 2018, the corporate performance objectives for our Chief Medical Officer were related to the continued clinical and regulatory development of Gimoti. These performance objectives and area of emphasis was used as a guide by the compensation committee and board of directors in determining overall corporate performance for purposes of our Chief Medical Officer's annual bonus as it represented the area in which she was expected to focus her efforts during the year.  Both qualitative and quantitative guidelines were established for purposes of evaluating her performance relating to these corporate objectives during 2018. As a result of the clinical development milestones related to Gimoti that were attained, including (1) submission of the NDA to FDA; (2) acceptance of the NDA by FDA; and (3) management of communications with FDA during NDA review. The compensation committee determined to award a corporate achievement level of 105% for our Chief Medical Officer.
The overall achievement level was then used to determine each named executive officer's bonus.  The bonuses paid to our named executive officers for 2018 are set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" above.
Equity Compensation 
The goals of our long-term, equity-based incentive awards are to align the interests of our named executive officers and other employees, non-employee directors and consultants with the interests of our stockholders. Because vesting is based on continued employment, our equity-based incentives also encourage the retention of our named executive officers through the vesting period of the awards. In determining the size of the long-term equity incentives to be awarded to our named executive officers, we take into account a number of internal factors, such as the relative job scope, the value of existing long-term incentive awards, individual performance history, prior contributions to us and the size of prior grants.  Our compensation committee reviews competitive market data prepared by Marsh & McLennan in connection with its grant of long-term equity incentive awards to the named executive officers, but such awards are not determined by reference to any specific target level of compensation or benchmarking. Based upon these factors, the compensation committee determines the size of the long-term equity incentives at levels it considers appropriate to create a meaningful opportunity for reward predicated on the creation of long-term stockholder value. We have not granted any equity awards other than stock options to date. 
To reward and retain our named executive officers in a manner that best aligns employees' interests with stockholders' interests, we use stock options as the primary incentive vehicles for long-term compensation. We believe that stock options are an effective tool for meeting our compensation goal of increasing long-term stockholder value by tying the value of the stock options to our future performance. Because employees are able to profit from stock options only if our stock price increases relative to the stock option's exercise price, we believe stock options provide meaningful incentives to employees to achieve increases in the value of our stock over time. 
The exercise price of each stock option grant is the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, as determined by our board of directors from time to time. Stock option awards granted to our named executive officers generally vest on a monthly basis over a four-year period.  From time to time, our compensation committee may, however, determine that a different vesting schedule is appropriate. 
In February 2018, our named executive officers were granted stock options to purchase shares of our common stock, which stock options vest on a monthly basis over a four-year period commencing January 1, 2018.  Specifically, Messrs. Gonyer and D'Onofrio and Dr. Carlson were granted options to purchase 225,000, 150,000 and 125,000 shares of our common stock, respectively.  These stock option grants are subject to exercisability restrictions.  Specifically, the options will not be exercisable prior to the first to occur of (1) FDA Approval, (2) the second anniversary of the date of grant, or (3) immediately prior to the consummation of a change in control (as defined in our 2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan). The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, remove these exercisability restrictions in connection with or following an officer's death, disability, or termination of employment or service.
In February 2019, our named executive officers were granted stock options to purchase shares of our common stock, which stock options vest on a monthly basis over a four-year period commencing January 1, 2019.  Specifically, Messrs. Gonyer and  D'Onofrio and Dr. Carlson were granted options to purchase 225,000, 150,000 and 125,000 shares of our common stock, respectively.
We have had no program, plan or practice pertaining to the timing of stock option grants to named executive officers coinciding with the release of material non-public information. Stock options granted to our named executive officers may be subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstance. For additional discussion, please see "Employment Agreements" above and "Termination and Change in Control Benefits" below.
Other Elements of Compensation  
Retirement Plans 
We currently maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, within limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the plan. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. We believe that providing a vehicle for tax-deferred retirement savings through our 401(k) plan adds to the overall desirability of our executive compensation package and further incentivizes our named executive officers in accordance with our compensation policies. 
Employee Benefits and Perquisites 
Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare plans.  We reimburse Dr. Carlson for her health care premiums and pay for the health and welfare benefits for our other named executive officers and our other four employees. We do not provide our named executive officers with any other significant perquisites or other personal benefits.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We maintain an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, that allows eligible employees to purchase our common stock at a discount, subject to applicable limits as set forth in the ESPP, through payroll deductions of up to 20% of their eligible compensation.  All of our employees participate in the ESPP on the same terms and conditions.
No Tax Gross-Ups 
We do not make gross-up payments to cover our named executive officers' personal income taxes that may pertain to any of the compensation paid or provided by our company. 
Termination and Change in Control Benefits 
Our named executive officers may become entitled to certain benefits or enhanced benefits in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment and/or a change in control of our company. Each of our named executive officers' employment agreements entitles them to severance in the event of their termination without cause or their resignation for good reason (and, for Mr. Gonyer and Mr. D'Onofrio, upon termination by reason of death or disability).  In addition, each named executive officer is entitled to accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards upon his or her termination without cause or their resignation for good reason within three months prior to the occurrence of a change in control or within 12 months following a change in control of our company. In addition, the occurrence of a change in control constitutes "good reason" for Mr. Gonyer's and Mr. D'Onofrio's resignation under their employment agreements. For additional discussion, please see "Employment Agreements" above.  Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Further, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers, and we have purchased a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment under certain circumstances. Stock Option Grants to Executive Officers and Directors 
We have granted stock options to our executive officers and certain of our directors as more fully described in the section "Executive Compensation and Other Information—Narrative Disclosure to Compensation Table—Equity Compensation" above.
Other Transactions with Related Parties
Our Chief Medical Officer, Marilyn Carlson, serves on the executive management team of a clinical research organization that provides clinical trial services to us.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred an aggregate of approximately $38,000 and $13,000, respectively, in fees for these services.  There were no related party transactions during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
Pursuant to our audit committee charter, our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all transactions with related parties which are required to be reported under applicable SEC regulations, other than compensation-related matters. We have not adopted written procedures for review of, or standards for approval of, these transactions, but instead our audit committee intends to review such transactions on a case by case basis.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities.  To our knowledge, based solely on our review of copies of such forms that we have received, or written representations from reporting persons, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all applicable filing requirements.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Proposals from stockholders intended to be presented at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020 must be received by us no later than November 22, 2019, which is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing date of this proxy, in order to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC for such proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to certain matters, including stockholder proposals not included in our proxy statement and director nominations, to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders. In general, notice of the proposal or nomination must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 calendar days before nor more than 120 calendar days before the one year anniversary of the date of the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. Therefore, to be presented at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, such a proposal must be received by us no earlier than January 3, 2020 and no later than February 2, 2020. However, if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice must be received not less than 90 calendar days before nor more than 120 calendar days in advance of such annual meeting, or if later, ten calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made. If the stockholder fails to give notice by these dates, then the persons named as proxies in the proxies solicited by the board of directors for the 2020 annual meeting may exercise discretionary voting power regarding any such proposal or nomination. Stockholders are advised to review our amended and restated bylaws which also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice. 
ANNUAL REPORT 
Our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 will be mailed to stockholders of record on or about March 21, 2019. Our annual report does not constitute, and should not be considered, a part of this proxy solicitation material. 
Any person who was a beneficial owner of our common stock on the record date may request a copy of our annual report, and it will be furnished without charge upon receipt of a written request identifying the person so requesting a report as a stockholder of our company at such date. Requests should be directed to Evoke Pharma, Inc., 420 Stevens Avenue, Suite 370, Solana Beach, California, Attention: Corporate Secretary.  OTHER MATTERS
We do not know of any business other than that described in this proxy statement that will be presented for consideration or action by the stockholders at the annual meeting. If, however, any other business is properly brought before the meeting, shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the persons named in the proxies or their substitutes. All stockholders are urged to complete, sign and return the accompanying proxy card in the enclosed envelope.
