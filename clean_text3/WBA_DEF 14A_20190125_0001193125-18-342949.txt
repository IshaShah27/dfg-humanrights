Our Company's performance was strong in fiscal 2018 with growth in many financial and operating metrics, including earnings, operating income, cash flow, U.S. prescriptions filled and U.S. retail prescription market share. Our businesses delivered continued progress while operating in the highly competitive healthcare and retail industries, which have experienced significant consolidation. 
We maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation during 2018; investing opportunistically to expand our offering and our footprint, drive growth and develop our human capital. We continued to demonstrate our commitment to return excess cash to our stockholders over the long term, through the 43rd consecutive annual increase in our dividend (including by our predecessor company, Walgreen Co.), as well as the authorization in June 2018 of a $10 billion share repurchase program. 
We are pleased to have completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores that we agreed to purchase from Rite Aid Corporation under an amended and restated asset purchase agreement. The transaction, including the transition of three distribution centers and related inventory that began during fiscal 2019, furthers our Company's commitment to accessible, affordable, quality healthcare in the U.S. and to advance consumer access to pharmacy-led health and wellbeing. 
Our Company touches millions of lives around the world every day, through the medicines we dispense and distribute, our convenient retail stores and our health and beauty products. Thus, we believe we are uniquely situated to help people, communities and the planet. The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee, which I chair and which is made up entirely of independent directors, continued to review and monitor our Company's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies and activities. 
The Board, through the Committee, shares in our Company's commitment to responsible leadership, sustainable business practices and transparency. Our Company has impacted millions of lives through our healthcare-centered CSR initiatives, helping to provide lifesaving immunizations, life-changing vitamins, health screening and HIV testing; educating our pharmacists to assist patients with the emotional as well as the physical aspects of cancer; supporting cancer research; providing access to healthcare services and continuity of care following natural disasters; and raising awareness around dementia and mental health. Consistent with input received from our stockholders, we took action to support our Company's efforts to help combat the U.S. opioid abuse crisis through the expansion of a safe medication takeback program and other initiatives. 
Our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on Friday, January 25, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time at the Lotte New York Palace, 455 Madison Avenue at 50th Street, New York, New York 10022. We look forward to seeing you there. Even if you cannot attend in person, your vote is very important. Please vote at your earliest convenience. 
On behalf of my fellow independent directors and the entire Board, thank you for your investment in Walgreens Boots Alliance and the trust and confidence it implies. 
Sincerely, 
William C. Foote 
Lead Independent Director

Rite Aid Transaction 
On September 19, 2017, we announced that we had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD) for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. 
The Company continues to expect to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020. The Company expects annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of the transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.

Stockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness 
We value an open dialogue with our stockholders, and we believe that regular communication with our stockholders and other stakeholders is a critical part of enabling our long-term success. During 2018, members of our management team met with many of our stockholders. This included, in advance of the Annual Meeting, formal governance-related outreach to over 30 of our largest stockholders, representing approximately 37% of our outstanding shares as of August 31, 2018 (approximately 44% when excluding shares held by affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer). 
In recent years, we have taken a number of actions, considering in part feedback received from our stockholders, to strengthen our governance and compensation programs and enhance the disclosure of our existing practices.

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
Executive Compensation Program 
We have a strong pay-for-performance philosophy, which seeks to link the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. Accordingly, we emphasize variable and performance-based compensation over fixed or guaranteed pay. 
Substantially all CEO compensation is comprised of long-term, performance-based equity incentives.

         Proposal 1: Election of Directors     
[END TABLE]
What am I voting on? 
Stockholders are being asked to elect 11 director nominees for a one-year term. 
What is the Board's voting recommendation? 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" each of the director nominees. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
What is the required vote? 
With respect to the election of directors, the number of votes "FOR" a director's election must be a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of our common stock voting in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting with respect to that director's election. Abstentions with respect to a director will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" him or her. 
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board has nominated 11 directors for election at the Annual Meeting, each to hold office until our next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or upon his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. 
All of the nominees are currently directors. Each nominee was elected to the Board by our stockholders at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting") with the support of more than 96% of votes cast. All of the nominees are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Each nominee has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. Consequently, we know of no reason why any of the nominees would be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, if any nominee is for any reason unable or unwilling to serve, the proxyholders intend to vote all proxies received by them for any substitute nominee proposed by the Board (consistent with any applicable terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, as defined and described further in "—Director Nomination Process—Shareholders' Agreement" below), unless the Board instead chooses to reduce its size. 
Director Nomination Process 
We believe decisions regarding the structure and composition of the Board are critical to ensuring a strong Board that is best suited to guide the Company in the future. As specified in its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees our director candidate nomination process. The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends to the Board a slate of candidates for election at each annual meeting of stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee's goal is to put forth a diverse slate of candidates with a combination of skills, experience, and personal qualities that will best serve the Board, the Company, and our stockholders. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers a wide range of factors when assessing potential director nominees. This assessment includes a review of the potential nominee's judgment, experience, independence, understanding of our business or other related industries, and such other factors as the Nominating and Governance Committee concludes are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board. With respect to the potential re-nomination of current directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee assesses their current contributions to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee also evaluates whether a potential director nominee meets the qualifications required of all directors and any of the key qualifications and experience to be represented on the Board, as described further in "—Board Membership Criteria" below. 
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Nominating and Governance Committee assesses how each potential nominee would impact the skills and experience represented on the Board as a whole in the context of the Board's overall composition and the current and future needs of the Company and the Board. Among other matters, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the results of the annual evaluation of the Board and its committees, which the Nominating and Governance Committee also oversees, when assessing potential director nominees. More detail regarding this annual evaluation process can be found in "Governance—Board Evaluation and Director Peer Review Process" below. 
Board Refreshment and Committee Rotation 
The Board believes that refreshment, including periodic committee rotation, is important to help ensure that Board composition is aligned with the needs of the Company and the Board as our business evolves over time, and that fresh viewpoints and perspectives are regularly considered. 
As part of planning for director succession, the Nominating and Governance Committee periodically engages in the consideration of potential director candidates, often with the assistance of a third-party advisor or recruitment firm. Of the Board's nine independent directors, five have joined the Board since January 1, 2012. 
The Board also believes that directors develop an understanding of the Company and an ability to work effectively as a group over time that provides significant value, and therefore a significant degree of continuity year-over-year is beneficial to stockholders and generally should be expected. 
The Board does not have absolute limits on the length of time that a director may serve, but considers the tenure of directors as one of several factors in re-nomination decisions. The Board has established a retirement age of 75. Subject to our contractual obligations and applicable law, no individual is eligible for election to the Board after his or her 75th birthday unless the Nominating and Governance Committee makes a finding that the nomination of the individual is in the best interests of the Company notwithstanding the individual's age, and the nomination is also approved by the Board. 
Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will be older than this retirement age as of the date of the Annual Meeting. However, as described further in "—Shareholders' Agreement" below, Mr. Pessina is the contractual designee of the SP Investors (as defined below) for nomination to the Board, and the Shareholders' Agreement (as defined below) includes a contractual waiver of any mandatory retirement age policy applicable to his service on the Board. 
While the Board believes that age and tenure are important considerations in assessing Board composition, it also believes the best interests of the Company are served by being able to take advantage of all available talent. Therefore, the Board does not intend to make determinations with regard to its membership based solely on age or tenure. 
Majority Voting Standard 
Our by-laws state that if a nominee for director who was in office prior to the Annual Meeting is not elected and no successor is elected at such Annual Meeting, the director must promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board. Thereafter, the Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether to take other action. The Board, excluding the director in question, will act on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee and publicly disclose its decision and its rationale within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. 
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Stockholder-Recommended Director Candidates 
Nominees may be suggested by directors, members of management, stockholders, or other third parties. Stockholders who would like the Nominating and Governance Committee to consider their recommendations for director nominees should submit their recommendations in writing by mail to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., 108 Wilmot Road, MS #1858, Deerfield, Illinois 60015, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers stockholder-recommended candidates on the same basis as other suggested nominees. 
Stockholder-Nominated Director Candidates ("Proxy Access") 
In October 2015, after engaging with a number of our stockholders to understand their views on the desirability of proxy access and the appropriate proxy access framework for the Company, we adopted a proxy access by-law. This by-law permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in Article II, Section 2.20 of our by-laws. See "Additional Information—Director Nominations for Inclusion in the Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting" below for more information. 
Stockholders, including those stockholders who are not eligible to nominate director candidates under our proxy access by-law, may also nominate director candidates in accordance with the advance notice provisions described in our by-laws. See "Additional Information—Other Proposals or Director Nominations for Presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting" below for more information. 
Shareholders' Agreement 
On August 2, 2012, in connection with Walgreens' acquisition of 45% of Alliance Boots GmbH ("Alliance Boots"), Walgreens, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. ("KKR") and, inter alios, Stefano Pessina, our current Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (and together with certain of his affiliates, the "SP Investors") entered into a Shareholders' Agreement (the "Shareholders' Agreement"). Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain common stock beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions, the SP Investors are entitled to designate a nominee for election to the Board.

On the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board adopted the Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities on behalf of the Company and our stockholders. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are intended to provide guidance as a component of the flexible framework within which the Board, assisted by its committees, oversees and directs the affairs of the Company. The Corporate Governance Guidelines establish policies and practices with respect to numerous areas of Board operations and responsibilities, including in the areas of Board structure and leadership and director independence. The Board periodically reviews the Corporate Governance Guidelines and updates them in response to changing regulatory requirements and evolving best practices. A copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines can be found at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com/corporate-governance.cfm. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board selects a Chairman from among its members annually following the election of Board members. Our by-laws provide that the Chairman of the Board may, but need not, be the Chief Executive Officer. 
Currently, the roles of Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer are held by different persons. James A. Skinner serves as the Executive Chairman of the Board, and Stefano Pessina serves as our Chief Executive Officer. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines state that if the Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer or another director who does not qualify as independent, then the independent directors will select a Lead Independent Director to help ensure robust independent leadership on the Board. William C. Foote was selected by the independent directors to serve as Lead Independent Director. 
GOVERNANCE 
As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Foote's responsibilities include:

The Board believes that this structure is optimal at this time because it allows Mr. Pessina to focus on leading our business and operations. At the same time, Mr. Skinner can focus on leadership of the Board, including calling and presiding over its meetings and preparing meeting agendas in collaboration with Messrs. Pessina and Foote, while working collaboratively with senior management. Similarly, Mr. Foote can lead executive sessions of the independent directors, serve as a liaison and supplemental channel of communication between independent directors and Messrs. Skinner and Pessina, and serve as a sounding board and advisor to Messrs. Skinner and Pessina. 
Director Independence 
Under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board must consist of a substantial majority (at least two-thirds) of independent directors. In making independence determinations, the Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances and observe all applicable requirements, including the relevant listing standards established by Nasdaq. 
To be considered "independent" for these purposes, (a) the director must meet the bright-line independence standards under Nasdaq listing standards, and (b) the Board must affirmatively determine that the director otherwise has no material 
GOVERNANCE 
relationship with the Company, either as a director or as an officer, stockholder, or partner of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. In each case, the Board shall broadly consider all relevant facts and circumstances. 
To aid in the director independence assessment process, the Board has adopted categorical standards that identify categories of relationships that the Board has determined would not affect a director's independence. These categorical standards, which are part of the Corporate Governance Guidelines, stipulate that the following will not be considered material relationships that would impair a director's independence: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Immaterial Sales/Purchases      At the time  of the independence determination, the director is an executive officer or employee, or an immediate family member of such director is an executive officer, of another organization that does business with us and the sales by that organization to us,  or purchases by that organization from us, in any single fiscal year during the evaluation period, are less than the greater of (i) $200,000 or (ii) 5% of the annual revenues of that organization. For the avoidance of doubt, payments arising solely  from investments in our securities are not included in received payments for this purpose.   
   Immaterial Sales/Purchases      At the time  of the independence determination, the director is an executive officer or employee, or an immediate family member of such director is an executive officer, of another organization that does business with us and the sales by that organization to us,  or purchases by that organization from us, in any single fiscal year during the evaluation period, are less than the greater of (i) $200,000 or (ii) 5% of the annual revenues of that organization. For the avoidance of doubt, payments arising solely  from investments in our securities are not included in received payments for this purpose.

For the avoidance of doubt, payments arising solely  from investments in our securities are not included in received payments for this purpose.   
   Immaterial Indebtedness      At the time  of the independence determination, the director is an executive officer or employee, or an immediate family member of such director is an executive officer, of another organization that is indebted to us, or to which we are indebted, and the total  amount of either entity's indebtedness to the other at the end of the last completed fiscal year is less than 5% of the other entity's total consolidated assets.   
   Immaterial Indebtedness      At the time  of the independence determination, the director is an executive officer or employee, or an immediate family member of such director is an executive officer, of another organization that is indebted to us, or to which we are indebted, and the total  amount of either entity's indebtedness to the other at the end of the last completed fiscal year is less than 5% of the other entity's total consolidated assets.   
   Immaterial Charitable Donations      At the time  of the independence determination, the director serves as an executive officer, director, or trustee of a charitable organization, and our discretionary charitable contributions to the organization are less than the greater of (i) $200,000 or (ii)  5% of that organization's annual consolidated gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. Our automatic matching of employee charitable contributions will not be included in the amount of our contributions for this purpose.

[END TABLE]
Dominic P. Murphy 
As previously disclosed, prior to October 2017, the Board did not determine that Dominic P. Murphy was independent because (a) Mr. Murphy previously served as a Partner at KKR, and (b) at times during his service, KKR was a significant investor in Alliance Boots and was a party to Walgreens' acquisition of a 45% interest in Alliance Boots on August 2, 2012 and Walgreens' subsequent acquisition of the remaining 55% interest on December 31, 2014 (the "Second Step Transaction"). 
On August 1, 2016, KKR and its affiliates no longer met the beneficial ownership thresholds under the Shareholders' Agreement entitling them to designate a nominee for election to the Board, and consequently this right terminated. Furthermore, on November 1, 2016, KKR sold the remaining shares of our common stock that it acquired as part of the foregoing transactions. 
On June 30, 2017, Mr. Murphy resigned as a Partner of KKR. While Mr. Murphy or his affiliates may continue to hold economic interests in KKR funds or other affiliates acquired during his prior employment with KKR, he no longer has any right to control or direct the affairs of KKR, including with respect to its investment decisions and management of its portfolio companies. 
The Board considered all of these changes in circumstances as part of its annual director independence review. Based on this, and such other facts and circumstances as it deemed appropriate (including representations made by Mr. Murphy and 
GOVERNANCE 
advice of legal counsel), the Board has determined that there are no continuing relationships that would interfere with Mr. Murphy's exercise of independent judgment. Consequently, the Board has determined that Mr. Murphy is now an independent director under Nasdaq listing standards. 
Independence Determination 
As a result of its annual review, the Board has determined that none of the following director nominees has a material relationship with the Company and, as a result, the following director nominees are independent: José E. Almeida, Janice M. Babiak, David J. Brailer, William C. Foote, Ginger L. Graham, John A. Lederer, Dominic P. Murphy, Leonard D. Schaeffer, and Nancy M. Schlichting. 
James A. Skinner, the Executive Chairman of the Board, has served in an executive capacity since January 2015 and therefore is not an independent director. Stefano Pessina, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Board and our Chief Executive Officer, is also not an independent director. 
Each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), and the Nominating and Governance Committee is required to be independent in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee is independent as defined in our independence standards, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and applicable stock exchange listing standards.

The table below summarizes the relationships that were considered in connection with the independence determinations. None of the transactions described below were considered material relationships that impacted the applicable director's independence.

GOVERNANCE 
Related Party Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written policy for the review of certain related party transactions, including those that are required to be disclosed in this Proxy Statement. For purposes of this policy, a "related party transaction" includes, subject to certain exceptions, a transaction (or series of transactions) in which (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or will be a participant, (ii) the aggregate amount involved will exceed, or may be reasonably expected to exceed, $120,000 in any fiscal year, and (iii) any related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The policy defines a "related person" to include any of our directors, director nominees, or executive officers; a holder of more than 5% of our common stock; and immediate family members of any of the foregoing. 
Pursuant to this policy, all such related party transactions must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Nominating and Governance Committee. In the event that a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee has an interest in a related party transaction, the transaction must be approved or ratified by the disinterested members of the Nominating and Governance Committee. In deciding whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, among other factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The purpose of, and the potential benefits to the Company of, the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The extent of the related party's interest in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction is fair to the Company and on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an  unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction would impair the independence of a Non-Employee Director;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any of our directors, director nominees or  executive officers, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the applicable related person, the direct or indirect nature of the applicable related person's interest in the transaction, and the ongoing  nature of any proposed relationship.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders' Agreement 
Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, for so long as the SP Investors meet certain common stock beneficial ownership thresholds, and subject to certain other conditions, the SP Investors are entitled to designate a nominee for election to the Board. Mr. Pessina is the current designee of the SP Investors. 
The Shareholders' Agreement also includes, among other things, registration rights, standstill provisions, and restrictions on the SP Investors' ability to dispose of shares of our common stock or to acquire additional shares of our common stock. 
Transactions with Alliance Healthcare Italia S.p.A. and its Affiliates 
From time to time, we or our subsidiaries have entered into, or may be deemed to have entered into by virtue of our acquisition of Alliance Boots, certain equity-related transactions and agreements with affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a director of the Company, and an indirect holder of more than 5% of our common stock. Alliance Healthcare Italia SpA ("AHI") is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by Stefano Pessina, in which the Company has an indirect 9% interest. 
On January 1, 2015, WBAD Holdings Limited ("WBAD Holdings"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, transferred 320 common shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH ("WBAD"), our global sourcing enterprise, to a subsidiary of AHI, Alliance Healthcare Italia Distribuzione S.p.A. ("AHID"), in exchange for 32,000 Swiss francs. WBAD Holdings retained the remainder of the equity interests in WBAD, which consist of 6,000 preferred shares. In August 2018, all of the preferred shares of WBAD were transferred to our wholly-owned subsidiary, WBAD Holdings 2 Limited ("WBAD Holdings 2"). As the holder of common shares, AHID is only entitled to its pro rata share (approximately 5%) of any dividends paid by WBAD in excess of $3 billion per annum. Upon the liquidation of WBAD, AHID is entitled to receive its pro rata share (approximately 
GOVERNANCE 
5%) of 10% of the net proceeds of such liquidation. Under certain circumstances, AHID has the right to put, and WBAD Holdings 2 has the right to call, the common shares of WBAD held by AHID for a purchase price of $100,000. 
In August 2017, a dividend was declared by an affiliate of AHI to its shareholders. Our pro rata portion of the dividend for our 9% interest in the affiliate, which was paid during 2018, was approximately $967,000. 
Certain of our executive officers or other employees may provide services to AHI and its affiliates; and AHI and its affiliates may provide services to us and our subsidiaries. Furthermore, we and our subsidiaries may sell products to AHI and its affiliates, and AHI and its affiliates may sell products to us and our subsidiaries. These services and products are procured on an arm's-length basis pursuant to written agreements between the relevant parties. 
In 2018, following partial de-regulation of the Italian pharmacy market, the agreement pursuant to which services are provided on an arm's length basis was amended to allow additional retail advisory and related services to be provided to AHI to facilitate AHI's intention to conduct a trial of Boots-branded stores in Italy, to assist with the possible roll out of further Boots branded stores (subject to the success of the pilot stores), and to make certain other changes to the agreement. Further, a distribution agreement was entered into between a subsidiary of the Company and AHI, which replaced previous distribution agreements between the parties and which allows AHI to purchase products on an arm's length basis for sale in Boots branded stores in Italy. Pursuant to licences entered into between Alliance Boots and AHI prior to the acquisition of Alliance Boots by Walgreens in December 2014, and a store operations agreement entered into in 2018, AHI was granted the right to use certain trademarks and other intellectual property in the promotion, advertisement and sale of certain products in accordance with such agreements. 
In 2018, pursuant to the agreements described above, the Company and its subsidiaries provided products and services valued at $2.93 million to AHI and its affiliates, of which payment of $2.08 million remained due at the end of 2018, which amount was subsequently paid. 
In 2018, AHI and its affiliates provided services and products valued at $8.657 million to subsidiaries of the Company on an arm's length basis, of which payment of $0.94 million remained due at the end of 2018, which amount was subsequently paid. The increase in value of the products and services provided by AHI to subsidiaries of the Company compared to the prior year was principally due to a change in the sourcing of certain product which previously was purchased through a third party intermediary and now is purchased directly from AHI on an arm's length basis. 
Other Relationships and Transactions 
Mr. Pessina and Ms. Barra are partners and share a private residence. As noted in "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below, Ms. Barra reports to James A. Skinner, the Executive Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Skinner is the only member of management who makes recommendations concerning Ms. Barra's compensation to the Compensation Committee. For a description of Ms. Barra's 2018 compensation and benefits, see "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. 
Mr. Pessina has two children employed by the Company in non-executive officer capacities. Jacopo Pessina serves as Director, M&A and Healthcare Innovation—International and Elena Pessina serves as Head of International Coordination, Agency Operations. Each received total compensation in 2018 of more than $120,000, and the compensation of each is comparable to other Company employees at a similar level.

The Compensation Committee is supported in its work by our independent compensation consultant, Mercer LLC ("Mercer"). Mercer provides the Compensation Committee with information regarding market compensation and practices, assists the Compensation Committee in the review and evaluation of such compensation and practices, and advises the Compensation Committee on executive compensation decisions. Mercer also assists the Compensation Committee in the review and evaluation of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. Beginning in January 2016, we also engaged Mercer to serve as the executive compensation consultant to the Company. 
For 2018, Mercer's fees for executive and Non-Employee Director compensation consulting services were approximately $855,000. 
Mercer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies ("MMC"). In 2018, MMC and its affiliates (excluding Mercer) provided certain services to us and our affiliates unrelated to executive and Non-Employee Director compensation, primarily insurance brokerage and other professional services. For these services, MMC and its affiliates received compensation totaling approximately $1.6 million, excluding insurance premiums that are paid through MMC to insurance carriers on behalf of us and our affiliates. These non-compensation-related services and fees are not subject to the Compensation Committee's review or approval. The Mercer consultants providing services to the Compensation Committee and the Company do not market or sell to us, nor do they receive incentive or other compensation based on, these non-compensation-related services. 
The Compensation Committee considered the independence of Mercer under applicable SEC rules and regulations and Nasdaq listing standards. Based on its review, the Compensation Committee determined that the services provided by MMC and its affiliates and the engagement of Mercer did not raise any conflict of interest or other issues that would adversely impact Mercer's independence.

GOVERNANCE 
Board Oversight of Strategy and Risk Management 
Strategy 
Oversight of our business strategy is a key responsibility of the Board. Throughout the year, the Board and its committees provide oversight and guidance to management regarding our strategy, operating plans, and overall performance. While elements of strategy are embedded in every regularly-scheduled meeting of the Board, the Board also dedicates at least one multi-day meeting each year to focus on our long-term business strategic planning. 
The Board, primarily through its Finance Committee, also dedicates significant focus to reviewing our capital allocation strategy. Our current Board-approved capital allocation policy, which was approved and announced in 2014, is designed to ensure a balanced and disciplined approach to deploying capital intended to drive business growth and generate strong returns, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases over the long-term. 
While the Board and its committees oversee elements of our strategic planning, our management is charged with executing the business strategy. To monitor our performance against our strategic goals, the Board receives regular updates and actively engages in dialogue with our executive management team. Directors may also periodically visit certain of our stores and other locations to see our strategy execution first hand. 
The Board's oversight and our management's execution of our business strategy are intended to help promote the creation of long-term stockholder value in a sustainable manner, with a focus on assessing both potential opportunities available to us and risks that we might encounter. 
Risk Management 
We face a broad array of risks, including market, operational, strategic, legal, regulatory, reputational, and financial risks. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining systems to manage these risks. The Board exercises oversight over the elements and dimensions of major risks that we face. The Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its committees, and uses the processes described below to help assess and monitor the risks we face. 
We have established a global enterprise risk management ("ERM") program, which is led by our Global Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer. Our Governance, Risk and Compliance Committee, which is comprised of key members of executive management, oversees and monitors the activities of our ERM program and reviews, on a regular basis, the top current and emerging enterprise risks we face, and relevant risk mitigation activities. This global ERM approach helps the Board and its committees receive relevant information about risks and understand our risk management process, the participants in the process, and key information gathered through the process. 
The purpose of the ERM process is to identify risks that could affect us and the achievement of our objectives; to understand, assess, and prioritize those risks; and to facilitate the implementation of risk management strategies and processes across the Company. 
In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee reviews our policies and processes with respect to enterprise risk assessment and risk management, including major litigation and financial risks. On a regular basis, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses the key risks identified in the ERM process with management, their potential impact on us, and our risk mitigation strategies. In addition, the Audit Committee conducts regular reviews of the efficacy of our information security and technology risks (including cybersecurity) and related policies and procedures, which include receiving reports from our Global Chief Information Officer and other members of senior management who are tasked with monitoring cybersecurity risks. 
GOVERNANCE 
The other standing committees of the Board oversee management of risks relating to their respective areas of responsibility. For example, the Compensation Committee reviews risks associated with the design and implementation of our compensation plans and arrangements (see "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—IX. Other Matters—A. Compensation Risk Oversight" below), the Finance Committee oversees key aspects of our financial risk management activities, and the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews risks related to our governance structures and processes. 
Director Orientation and Continuing Education 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the Board shall maintain an orientation process for new directors. As part of this process, each new director receives a series of in-person briefings provided by our corporate officers on our business operations; significant financial, accounting and risk management matters; corporate governance; and key policies and practices. The new director also receives briefings on the responsibilities, duties, and activities of the committees on which the director will initially serve. Finally, the new director has the opportunity to visit and learn more about each of our divisions and select cross-divisional functions, both within and outside of the U.S., where he or she receives additional in-person briefings from divisional and cross-functional leadership. The Nominating and Governance Committee develops and oversees this orientation program with the assistance of our management. 
Our directors are encouraged to participate in director continuing education programs sponsored by third-party organizations. Our executive management team also periodically provides materials and briefing sessions on subjects that assist directors in fulfilling their duties. Directors are encouraged to visit our facilities and operations and to directly communicate and interact with our senior management, which allows them to gain a first-hand view of our business. 
Board Evaluation and Director Peer Review Process 
The Board recognizes that a robust evaluation process is an essential component of strong corporate governance practices and promoting Board effectiveness. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees an annual evaluation process led by the Lead Independent Director (who also serves as Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee). 
Each director completes an annual self-evaluation of the Board and the committees on which he or she serves. These self-evaluations are designed to help assess the skills, qualifications, and experience represented on the Board and its committees, and to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. The results of this annual self-evaluation are discussed by the full Board and each committee, as applicable, and changes to the Board's and its committees' practices are implemented as appropriate. 
The Lead Independent Director also conducts a confidential director peer review process. As part of this process, the Lead Independent Director speaks with each other director individually to obtain insights regarding the contributions of other directors (and the Executive Chairman of the Board may speak with each other director regarding the contributions of the Lead Independent Director), and to discuss issues in greater depth and obtain more targeted feedback with respect to Board, committee and individual director effectiveness. The results of this peer review process may be considered by the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee along with other factors in director re-nomination decisions. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the format of the Board evaluation and director peer review process as necessary to help ensure that the solicited feedback remains relevant and appropriate. 
GOVERNANCE 
Additional Topics of Interest 
Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility 
Our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") is embedded in our drive to operate both a sustainable and profitable enterprise for the long-term. Around the world, every day, millions of people rely on the medicines we distribute and dispense and on the products we provide to support their daily living. Advancing our environmental, social, and governance performance through our CSR initiatives builds trust in our businesses and in our brands, helping us to drive our financial performance and to achieve our vision of being the first choice for pharmacy, wellbeing, and beauty—caring for people and communities around the world. 
Since the combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in December 2014, we have worked diligently to align our global CSR strategies. In 2016, in part through conversations with our stockholders and other stakeholders (such as non-governmental organizations and government bodies and agencies), we defined 12 CSR goals for the Company, which we continued to use in 2017 and 2018. We believe these 12 CSR goals represent the areas where we, given our businesses, scale, and global reach, can have the most impact. We group these 12 CSR goals into four key areas as follows:

[END TABLE]
We have enhanced our disclosure of sustainability and CSR progress, most recently through the publication of our Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 (the "2017 CSR Report"). The 2017 CSR Report details our CSR initiatives and accomplishments, including how our 12 CSR goals are mapped to one or multiple of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The 2017 CSR Report was prepared to be in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. In the report we provide disclosure on priority CSR issues based on consultation with stakeholders to determine where we have the greatest economic, environmental and social impacts. We expect further alignment between our disclosure and the GRI Standards to be included in our next Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which we expect to publish in January 2019. 
In order to help enhance the credibility and transparency of our CSR-related data, we engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), our independent registered public accounting firm, to conduct a review of selected indicators within our 2017 CSR Report in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Their assurance report can be found in the 2017 CSR Report. 
GOVERNANCE 
Having appropriate oversight and governance of our CSR program is critical to its success. Our senior leadership has established a CSR Committee to play a leading role in providing this oversight and governance. The CSR Committee is chaired by our Co-Chief Operating Officer, Ornella Barra, and includes senior executives from our key business functions as well as from our Legal, Human Resources, and Communications functions. The CSR Committee meets regularly and, among other obligations, is charged with reviewing our CSR program (including the selection and approval of our CSR goals and the oversight of our CSR policy statements) and our progress towards achieving our CSR goals. 
At the Board level, in accordance with its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews, at least annually, our policies and activities regarding sustainability and CSR and assesses our management of risks with respect thereto. The Board believes that the Nominating and Governance Committee is the appropriate committee to discharge this obligation because sustainability and CSR matters represent a critical focus area of our corporate governance and that the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee, who are all independent directors, are able to effectively provide objective oversight of our CSR program and related initiatives. 
In addition to the Nominating and Governance Committee's direct oversight, and as noted in "—Board Oversight of Strategy and Risk Management" above, the Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses the key risks identified in the ERM process with management, their potential impact on us and our operations, and our risk mitigation strategies. These risks may include risks related to climate change, sustainability, and other CSR-related matters. 
We are proud of the impact our CSR activities have on people in our communities and around the world. The Company has impacted millions of lives through our healthcare-centered CSR initiatives, such as helping to provide lifesaving immunizations and life-changing vitamins to communities across the globe. We have reduced our carbon footprint through energy efficiency initiatives, implemented responsible sourcing programs for our owned product brands and expanded a model program for training and hiring people with disabilities. To learn more about our sustainability and CSR efforts, please view our 2017 CSR Report and other information on our website at http://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/corporate-social-responsibility-report. 
Public Policy Engagement 
Primarily through Walgreens, we engage in the political and policymaking processes in the U.S., at the federal, state, and local levels, to participate in democratic self-government and to have a voice in public policy debates that have a direct impact on us. We exercise our responsibility to actively participate in the political process by supporting candidates whose policies and goals are consistent with our purpose to help people across the world lead healthier and happier lives, and that are aligned with the interests of our businesses, customers, communities, and stockholders. Policies on which we focused in 2018 included reimbursement for pharmacist-delivered clinical services, the expansion of the role of pharmacists in the healthcare delivery system, retail business regulation, and taxation. 
We work to advance this agenda in part through: (1) contributing to candidates, parties, and political organizations, both directly from corporate funds and through the Walgreen Co. Political Action Committee; (2) supporting a government relations program that aims to educate elected officials and regulatory agencies on key public policy issues; and (3) our membership in trade associations. 
All of our political and advocacy activities are intended to focus on promoting our business and strategic interests without regard to the personal political preferences or affiliations of any of our directors, officers, or employees. 
Walgreens' Government Relations organization is responsible for the day-to-day implementation of our political advocacy and contributions. Walgreens' Government Relations department relies on inside and outside legal counsel, when appropriate, to help ensure our compliance with laws applicable to these activities. 
GOVERNANCE 
As with sustainability and CSR-related matters, the Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for the oversight of policies and activities regarding political advocacy and contributions. At least annually, the Nominating and Governance Committee receives a report regarding these activities from senior management in Walgreens' Government Relations organization. 
Additional information about our public policy engagement efforts, including our Political Engagement and Contributions Policy and a report of certain trade associations to which Walgreens belonged during calendar years 2017 and 2018, can be found on our website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com/corporate-governance.cfm by clicking on "Policy Engagement." 
Code of Conduct and Business Ethics 
We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors. We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for CEO and Financial Executives that applies to and has been signed by our Chief Executive Officer, Global Chief Financial Officer, and Global Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. These can be found at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com/corporate-governance.cfm. 
We intend to promptly disclose on our website, in accordance with applicable rules, any required disclosure of changes to or waivers, if any, of our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics or our Code of Ethics for CEO and Financial Executives. 
Our employees, partners, suppliers, and customers can ask questions about our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics or our Code of Ethics for CEO and Financial Executives, or report suspected violations of these codes, our policies, or the law, through one of the confidential reporting telephone lines or website addresses listed in our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics or by e-mailing wbacompliance@wba.com. 
Stockholder Engagement 
We value an open dialogue with our stockholders, and we believe that regular communication with our stockholders and other stakeholders is a critical part of enabling our long-term success. 
The Board believes that, in most circumstances, our Chief Executive Officer and other authorized members of our senior management are best positioned to speak on behalf of the Company with our stockholders. However, the Board or its committees regularly receive reports on our stockholder engagement activities, and are provided with the opportunity to discuss and ask questions about significant stockholder feedback we receive. The Board and its committees also regularly consider stockholder perspectives, among other considerations, when making decisions related to their specific duties and responsibilities. Finally, the Corporate Governance Guidelines state that, from time to time, upon the reasonable request of one of our major stockholders, the Lead Independent Director will make himself available for consultation and direct communication with such stockholder where appropriate. 
During 2018, members of our management team met with a number of our stockholders to discuss, among other topics, our business, financial, and operating performance; capital allocation priorities; corporate governance; executive compensation; and sustainability and CSR initiatives. This included, in advance of the Annual Meeting, formal governance-related outreach to over 30 of our largest stockholders, representing approximately 37% of our outstanding shares as of August 31, 2018 (approximately 44% excluding those shares held by affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), in advance of the Annual Meeting. 
GOVERNANCE 
In part as a result of stockholder feedback, in recent years, we have taken a number of actions to strengthen our governance and executive compensation programs and enhance the disclosure of our existing practices.

• Taking into account the strong support demonstrated by our stockholders through both our direct engagement efforts as well  as through the results of the say-on-pay advisory vote at our 2018 Annual Meeting, the Compensation Committee maintained the core structure of our overall executive  compensation program while implementing a limited number of changes, including revisions to the mix of forms of equity used in the Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP") and the retirement provisions applicable to LTIP awards that will be  included in the applicable award agreements.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Each Non-Employee Director receives compensation for his or her service to the Board. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Skinner, our Executive Chairman, are employees of the Company and therefore do not receive any additional compensation for their service to the Board. Information about their compensation can be found in "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—VI. CEO and Executive Chairman Compensation" and "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee is charged with reviewing all elements of Non-Employee Director compensation and recommending to the Board any changes. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee Director compensation annually after reviewing the Compensation Committee's recommendations, if any. 
Cash Retainers 
In 2018, each Non-Employee Director received a $100,000 annual cash retainer (a $5,000 increase from 2017). Also in 2018, the Lead Independent Director received an additional annual cash retainer of $40,000, the Chair of the Audit Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $25,000, and the Chairs of the other standing Board committees received an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000. All cash retainers were paid in quarterly installments. 
Equity-Based Awards 
A substantial portion of each Non-Employee Director's annual compensation is in the form of equity, which the Board believes helps align his or her compensation with the interests of our stockholders. Under the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Incentive Plan"), each Non-Employee Director is granted fully-vested shares of our common stock annually, on a date determined by the Board (currently November 1), for his or her service during the prior twelve months. 
In 2018, each Non-Employee Director received a grant (pro-rated in the case of Mr. Almeida, who joined the Board in April 2017) of our common stock with a market value of $200,000 as of the grant date (November 1, 2017). This grant was made under the Omnibus Incentive Plan for service as a director from November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017. This grant value increased by $10,000 from the 2017 director grant values. 
Deferral Opportunities 
Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the following deferral opportunities are available as elected by the Non-Employee Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All cash retainer payments may be deferred into a deferred cash compensation account or awarded in the form of deferred  stock units ("DSUs"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual stock grant may be awarded in the form of DSUs.  
[END TABLE]
All amounts deferred into the deferred cash compensation account accrue interest at a monthly compounding rate equal to 120% of the applicable federal midterm rate. The Omnibus Incentive Plan provides Non-Employee Directors with election options relating to the timing and form of payment of account balances following termination of his or her service as a director, subject to certain restrictions. 
Other 
A Non-Employee Director who joins the Board during a fiscal year receives pro-rated amounts for all elements of his or her compensation for such fiscal year. A Non-Employee Director who leaves the Board during a fiscal year is entitled to retain any portion of his or her cash retainer already received for his or her service during such fiscal year, but is not entitled to receive a pro-rated equity award on the following November 1 for such pro-rated service. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
All directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with meetings of the Board and its committees. On a very limited basis, we may determine that it is appropriate for a Non-Employee Director to be accompanied by his or her spouse or partner in connection with these meetings and/or at other events related to such Non-Employee Director's service on the Board. In these circumstances, we also reimburse the spouse's or partner's travel expenses. In addition, in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses related to continuing education programs. 
Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We have adopted stock ownership guidelines for Non-Employee Directors. Under these guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected to accumulate shares of our common stock equal to the lesser of (a) 20,000 shares of our common stock and (b) the number of shares valued at three times (3x) such director's total annual cash and equity compensation for Board service. Each Non-Employee Director is required to satisfy the stock ownership guidelines applicable to him or her within five years after first becoming subject to the guidelines. We consider DSUs as shares owned for purposes of compliance with these guidelines. 
As of the Record Date, each Non-Employee Director had either met these guidelines or, using reasonable assumptions regarding future director compensation and stock appreciation, was progressing towards meeting these guidelines within the prescribed time frame. 
The stock ownership guidelines applicable to Messrs. Pessina and Skinner are described further in "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—IX. Other Matters—B. Stock Ownership Guidelines" below. 
2018 Non-Employee Director Compensation 
The following table shows information regarding the compensation earned or paid during 2018 to Non-Employee Directors who served on the Board during the year. As noted above, Messrs. Skinner and Pessina are employees of the Company and therefore did not receive any additional compensation for their service to the Board.

The number of shares granted was calculated by dividing $200,000 by $67.01, the closing stock price on November 1, 2017 (pro-rated in the case of Mr. Almeida, who joined the Board in April 2017). All stock awards are fully vested at the grant date. See Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management below for information regarding the number of DSUs held by Non-Employee Directors as of the Record Date. 
➌ Represents dividends credited to DSUs. In addition to the amounts reported, directors are eligible to receive the same discount on merchandise purchased from us as we make available to employees generally.

Beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person possesses sole or shared power to vote or to direct the disposition of, as well as any shares that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days, including through the exercise of options or other rights. Under these rules, the same shares may be beneficially owned by more than one person if there is shared power to vote and/or shared power to direct the disposition of the shares. Except as otherwise noted, to our knowledge, the persons named possessed sole voting and investment power over such shares, and such shares are not subject to any pledge.

➏ Based on a Schedule 13D/A jointly filed with the SEC on July 17, 2018 by Alliance Santé Participations S.A. (ASP), NEWCIP S.A. (NEWCIP), and Stefano Pessina and a Form 4 filed with the SEC by Mr. Pessina on October 25, 2018. Such filings indicate that ASP has sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to the 144,788,821 shares that it holds directly and of record, that NEWCIP is the sole shareholder of ASP, and that Mr. Pessina holds 100% voting control over NEWCIP. Accordingly, each of NEWCIP and Mr. Pessina may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 144,788,821 shares held directly and of record by ASP. In such filing, each of ASP and NEWCIPs address is listed as 14, avenue du X Septembre, L-2550, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. 
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
➐ Shares are held by family trusts for which Mr. Schaeffer serves as co-trustee and over which he shares voting and investment control, and, in the case of one of the trusts, was a grantor and is a beneficiary. 
➑ Does not include an aggregate of 14,117 shares held by family members of current executive officers or directors, the beneficial ownership of which has been disclaimed by such executive officers or directors. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. The SEC has established specific due dates for these reports, and we are required to disclose in this Proxy Statement any known late filings or failures to file. Based on a review of such forms furnished to us and the written representations from our executive officers and directors, we believe that, during 2018, all such required reports were filed in a timely manner and disclosed all required transactions.

The Audit Committee has the sole responsibility to hire, evaluate and, if appropriate, replace our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has re-appointed Deloitte to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm and as auditors of our consolidated financial statements for 2019. Deloitte has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. 
The Audit Committee annually evaluates the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm and the senior audit engagement team, and determines whether to re-engage the current firm or consider other audit firms. Further information regarding the factors considered in this evaluation are described in "Audit Committee Report" below. 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. In the event of a negative vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
One or more representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees and Services 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, it has established a policy concerning the pre-approval of services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. Each proposed engagement not specifically identified by the SEC as impairing independence is evaluated for independence implications prior to our entering into a contract with the independent registered public accounting firm for such services. 
PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP 
The Audit Committee has approved in advance certain permitted services, the scope of which is consistent with auditor independence. These services are: (i) audits or reviews of subsidiaries that are filed with government and regulatory bodies and similar reports; (ii) services associated with SEC registration statements, other documents filed with the SEC or other documents issued in connection with securities offerings (for example, comfort letters or consents), and assistance in responding to SEC comment letters; (iii) consultations with management as to the accounting or disclosure of transactions or events and/or the actual or potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards, or interpretations by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"), or other regulatory or standard setting bodies; (iv) audits of employee benefit and pension plans; and (v) annual revenue certifications prepared for regulatory or commercial purposes. 
If the project is in a permitted category, then it is considered pre-approved by the Audit Committee. All other services require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Such engagements with total fees up to $500,000 require the approval of the Audit Committee Chair. Such engagements with total fees greater than $500,000 require the approval of the full Audit Committee. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee reviews a summary listing of service fees and a description of the nature of the engagement. 
All audit, audit-related, and tax services performed by Deloitte for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries in 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the regulations of the SEC. The Audit Committee considered and determined that such provision of non-audit services during 2018 was compatible with maintaining auditor independence.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Deloitte provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Deloitte's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed and confirmed with Deloitte its independence. 
As a result of this evaluation, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, subject to stockholder ratification. 
In addition to its appointment, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the oversight, compensation (including negotiation of audit fees), and retention of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee regularly monitors the audit, audit-related, tax, and other non-audit services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, specifically considering any potential challenges to auditor independence in the short-term and long-term. The applicable Company policy requires the Audit Committee to approve, in advance, certain audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in excess of certain amounts. Changes in audit and other permissible fees between years generally reflect significant acquisitions and divestitures, macro-economic factors, changes in systems and business prospects, or other factors that create efficiencies or disruptions for the Company. 
The Company's management is responsible for the Company's internal control over financial reporting, the financial reporting process, and the preparation of the Company's financial statements. Deloitte is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements and of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the PCAOB, and expressing opinions on the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and the Company's effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee does not itself prepare the Company's financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of such financial statements. 
In performing its monitoring and oversight function, the Audit Committee has established procedures to receive and track the handling of complaints regarding accounting, internal control, and auditing matters. The Audit Committee regularly meets with the Company's management, including its General Auditor, and has regular private sessions with the General Auditor without other members of management present. The Audit Committee also regularly meets with Deloitte, with and without members of the Company's management present. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's financial statements with management, including its General Auditor, as well as with Deloitte. The Audit Committee discussed with Deloitte the quality of the Company's accounting principles; the reasonableness of its critical accounting estimates and judgments; and the disclosures in its financial statements, including disclosures relating to significant accounting policies. The Audit Committee also discussed with Deloitte significant disputes with management, if any, as well as the matters required to be disclosed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the PCAOB. The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made by the Company's management, including its General Auditor, as well as by Deloitte.

[END TABLE]
What am I voting on? 
Stockholders are being asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs") as described in the "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" sections of this Proxy Statement. 
What is the Board's voting recommendation? 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" Proposal 3. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
What is the required vote? 
Approval of Proposal 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. If you elect to abstain, the abstention will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote on Proposal 3. 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, our stockholders have the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" sections of this Proxy Statement (a "say-on-pay proposal"). 
Our executive compensation program incorporates policies and practices that are designed to ensure that it is strongly aligned with our long-term goals and strategies and promotes responsible pay and governance practices. We believe our executive compensation program appropriately rewards performance and is aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We encourage our stockholders to read the "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and many of the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2018 with respect thereto. 
We value the feedback provided by our stockholders, who overwhelmingly supported our executive compensation program at the 2018 Annual Meeting with approximately 93.5% of votes cast. We have had discussions with many of our institutional stockholders on an ongoing basis regarding various corporate governance topics, including executive compensation, and the Compensation Committee and the Board take into account the views of our stockholders regarding the design and effectiveness of our executive compensation program. 
Our stockholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (which disclosure shall include the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any related material). 
As an advisory vote, this Proposal 3 is not binding on us or on the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed by our stockholders in their votes on this proposal, and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding our NEOs. 
It is expected that the next vote on a say-on-pay proposal will occur at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting").

B. Components of our 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation program, which includes several elements designed to support our compensation objectives and reward specific aspects of our financial performance that the Board believes are critical to driving long-term stockholder value in a sustainable manner. The Compensation Committee is dedicated to ensuring that a substantial portion of executive compensation is "at-risk" and variable, with nearly 100% of the total direct compensation paid to Messrs. Pessina and Skinner, and more than 80% of the total direct compensation paid to the other NEOs who served as executive officers of the Company during all of 2018, tied to Company performance. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting, our say-on-pay proposal received the support of approximately 93.5% of the votes cast. The Board and the Compensation Committee considered this vote as demonstrating strong support for our executive compensation program as currently designed. In addition, our say-on-pay proposal received the support of at least 95% of the votes cast at our 2017 and 2016 annual meetings of stockholders. 
The key components of our 2018 executive compensation program and how each supports our compensation objectives are listed below. Our executive compensation program design is substantially consistent with our 2017 executive compensation program design.

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
As noted elsewhere in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section, neither Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, nor James A. Skinner, our Executive Chairman, participates in our general executive compensation program. Mr. Pessina receives substantially all of his compensation in the form of performance shares and stock options, and Mr. Skinner receives substantially all of his compensation in the form of RSUs. Neither receives a base salary nor participates in the annual cash incentive program. Consequently, nearly 100% of the total direct compensation awarded to them is "at-risk" and tied exclusively to Company performance and/or changes in our stock price. For more information regarding Messrs. Pessina and Skinner's at-risk compensation, see "—VI. CEO and Executive Chairman Compensation" below. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the use of adjusted operating income as the sole, absolute metric for measuring Company performance under the Company's short-term incentive plan, and the use of cumulative adjusted earnings per share ("cumulative adjusted EPS") as the sole, absolute metric for measuring Company performance under the Company's performance share awards. These same metrics were used for the same purposes in 2017, promoting consistency year-over-year. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the selection of these metrics and considers whether to incorporate other metrics, including other financial, non-financial, or relative metrics, into its short- and long-term incentive compensation programs. For more information regarding the Compensation Committee's selection of these metrics, see "—III. Target Setting for Incentive Compensation" below. 
C.   2018 Management Transition 
Effective June 1, 2018, Mr. Kehoe assumed the role of Global Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Fairweather assumed the role of senior advisor to our Chief Executive Officer. In connection with this management transition, we entered into an offer letter with Mr. Kehoe and a contract amendment with Mr. Fairweather outlining the terms of their employment with the Company. 
Under the terms of the offer letter, Mr. Kehoe's initial base salary is $900,000 and his target annual cash incentive opportunity equals 125% of his base salary (prorated in the case of 2018 for his service with the Company during the year). In part to compensate Mr. Kehoe for compensation foregone at Mr. Kehoe's prior employer, the offer letter provided for (i) a $2.5 million cash bonus, payable as to 50% within 30 calendar days of the first day of his employment and as to the remaining 50% within 30 calendar days of the first anniversary of his employment (in each case subject to clawback for a termination for cause or resignation within one year of the payment date) and (ii) a one-time RSU grant with a grant date value of $4.5 million and vesting in one-third annual increments, subject to the achievement of a threshold performance goal. Mr. Kehoe did not participate in the Company's LTIP for 2018 in light of his June 2018 employment commencement date. 
We entered into a contract amendment with Mr. Fairweather, effective as of March 6, 2018 (the "Contract Amendment"). Pursuant to the Contract Amendment, Mr. Fairweather became senior advisor to our Chief Executive Officer for business development and finance matters effective June 1, 2018, and continued as an employee of the Company on a full-time basis until June 30, 2018 and on a reduced basis thereafter. The Contract Amendment provides for, among other items, an annualized base salary of £210,347 (approximately $292,300 based on exchange rates as of March 6, 2018) in lieu of his previous salary to reflect a reduction in expected work days and continued eligibility to participate in our LTIP at a level commensurate with his expected work level. 
For further information regarding the terms of Mr. Kehoe's offer letter and Mr. Fairweather's Contract Amendment, see "—VIII. Retirement and Other Benefits—C. Employment Agreements" below.

II. Executive Compensation Philosophy and Process 
A.  Compensation Philosophy 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing, implementing, and monitoring our executive compensation philosophy and objectives. The Compensation Committee typically reviews the philosophy on a quarterly basis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee's focus is to provide a competitive compensation package that enables  us to:    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Attract and retain talented executives;    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Reward Company and individual performance; and    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Link the interest of our senior executives to the interests of our stockholders.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation program is designed to:    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Be competitive with the pay practices of other companies of comparable size, scope, and industry;     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Attract and retain executives who can contribute to our future success as a global organization; and     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Create a strong linkage between pay and performance through the use of variable performance-based  short-term and long-term incentive awards, such that executives will receive higher compensation in more successful periods for the Company and lower compensation during less successful periods.    
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The Compensation Committee believes that it has designed and implemented an executive compensation program that appropriately balances our short-term and long-term strategic objectives and otherwise links executive compensation with stockholder value, with nearly 100% of the total direct compensation paid to Messrs. Pessina and Skinner, and more than 80% of the total direct compensation paid to the other NEOs who served as executive officers of the Company during all of 2018, tied to Company performance. 
Our executive compensation program, as described for Ms. Barra and Messrs. Kehoe, Gourlay and Fairweather, generally has broader eligibility and, in most cases, applies to our executives outside of those NEOs.

    CEO and Executive Chairman Target Pay Mix        All other NEO Average Target Pay Mix 
    CEO and Executive Chairman Target Pay Mix        All other NEO Average Target Pay Mix 
[END TABLE]
B. Compensation Decision-Making 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program, which includes our annual cash incentive and long-term equity compensation programs as well as our retirement and other benefit programs and practices. The Compensation Committee considers all elements of the program in total, as well as individual performance, Company-wide performance, and internal equity and market compensation considerations, when making executive compensation-related decisions. 
Our Executive Chairman, Mr. Skinner, and our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pessina, review annually the performance and pay level of each of our "senior executives" (i.e., certain Senior Vice President level executives and above), develop recommendations concerning the compensation of each senior executive, and present those recommendations to the Compensation Committee. Neither Mr. Skinner nor Mr. Pessina makes any recommendations concerning his own compensation. In addition, only Mr. Skinner (and not Mr. Pessina) makes recommendations concerning the compensation of Ms. Barra. 
Based on these recommendations, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of our management team and Mercer, our independent compensation consultant, establishes target pay levels for the NEOs and other senior executives. The Compensation Committee carefully considers historical and current market practices, internal equity issues, and established market trends and attempts, to the extent practicable, to mitigate the effect of short-term market fluctuations in setting senior executive compensation levels. 
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with Mercer, also considers the compensation levels and the mix of compensation in our peer group. 
In selecting companies for inclusion in our peer group, the Compensation Committee considers, among other factors, revenue size, industry, and the peer groups of our closest competitors. The Compensation Committee believes that our peer group is representative of the markets in which we compete for executive talent, and it includes companies in both the retail and healthcare industries. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The composition of our peer group is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Mercer, and is updated as appropriate. 
As previously disclosed, in July 2017, changes were made to our peer group for 2018 to increase the healthcare focus of the peer group. The Compensation Committee removed Archer Daniels Midland, AT&T, Best Buy, FedEx, Home Depot, Lowe's, United Parcel Service and Verizon from our peer group and added Abbott Laboratories, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana, Medtronic, Pfizer and UnitedHealth. The Compensation Committee believes that the peer group appropriately reflects the industries in which we compete for executive talent. The Compensation Committee also considers companies of similar global size, while balancing the need to have a peer group comprised of a sufficiently large number of companies so as to be able to derive meaningful insights and observations. 
Set forth below is our 2018 peer group: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Abbott Laboratories    Express Scripts       Mondelez 
   Abbott Laboratories    Express Scripts       Mondelez 
 Aetna    Humana    PepsiCo 
 Anthem    Johnson & Johnson    Pfizer 
 Cardinal Health    Kroger    Procter & Gamble 
 Cigna    McDonald's    Target 
 Coca-Cola    McKesson    United Health 
 Costco    Medtronic    Wal-Mart 
 CVS Health         
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has made no changes to the peer group for 2019. 
For the respective companies' most recently completed fiscal year for which data was available as of September 2018, we are at the 70th percentile of our peer group in terms of revenue reported and the 42nd percentile of our peer group in terms of market value. 
After the review of peer group data, the Compensation Committee establishes any base salary adjustments, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term incentive awards (as applicable) for the NEOs and our other senior executives. 
In each case, the Compensation Committee generally targets total direct compensation at rates that result in median market levels when compared to our peer group. The actual positioning of target total direct compensation relative to the median varies based on each senior executive's experience and skill set, and generally results in senior executives who are new to their role being placed lower in the range and those with more experience being placed higher in the range. 
The target total direct compensation can also be differentiated from the peer group median for, among other reasons, an individual's performance or other contributions to our long-term performance. 
C. Role of the Compensation Consultant 
As noted above, the Compensation Committee has engaged Mercer as its independent compensation consultant. Among other matters, the Compensation Committee uses Mercer to provide information regarding market compensation practices and trends and to advise the Compensation Committee on executive compensation decisions, particularly with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman, and Non-Employee Directors. A representative of Mercer meets regularly with the Compensation Committee and, as needed, has access to the Compensation Committee and its chair during and between regularly-scheduled meetings. 
Beginning in January 2016, we also engaged Mercer to serve as the executive compensation consultant to our management team. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and considered all of the relevant factors regarding our relationship with 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Mercer and, based upon this review, has concluded that the advice it receives from Mercer is and was objective and is and was not influenced by any relationships Mercer or its affiliates may otherwise have with our management team, the Board, the Company or its subsidiaries. See "Governance—Board Committees—Compensation Advisor" above for more information regarding our relationship with Mercer and its affiliates. 
III. Target Setting for Incentive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee set the short-term and long-term performance targets for our 2018 executive compensation program in October 2017. The Compensation Committee believes that the performance targets it established were rigorous yet achievable, and therefore established the targets so that they would be achieved, at the target performance level, if we successfully executed our operating plan for 2018 and the 2018-2020 performance period, therefore creating demonstrable value for our stockholders. 
A. 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Target 
The Compensation Committee approved the use of adjusted operating income as the sole, absolute metric for measuring Company-wide performance for purposes of payment of annual cash incentive awards for 2018. 
Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that refers to our operating income, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), as adjusted to reflect certain specified adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee. Such adjustments are made in accordance with the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP"), the plan under which we paid 2018 annual cash incentive awards to our executives. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to make these adjustments to help ensure that certain items that are non-operating or otherwise out of management's control do not impact payouts in either a positive or negative manner. 
The Compensation Committee considered a variety of key financial metrics for incentive purposes and determined that its use of the adjusted operating income metric is appropriate because it reflects our overall operating performance and ability to manage costs and operate efficiently. Adjusted operating income is also a key metric currently used by our senior executives to assess Company profitability and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. 
The Compensation Committee believes that a sole, absolute metric provides simplicity and allows management to focus on driving underlying performance against a metric that we believe is strongly correlated with the ability of our management to drive stockholder value in any given year. For the NEOs (other than Messrs. Pessina and Skinner, who do not receive annual cash incentives) and other corporate-level executives, these results are based on our consolidated performance, with no award tied to specific business unit performance. The Compensation Committee believes this reinforces the need for collaboration among those executives. 
For 2018, the adjusted operating income target was set at $7,878 million, which represented an increase over our 2017 results on an actual and constant currency basis. The target was set in relation to our 2018 budget, which was approved by the Board in October 2017, so that results could range between 50% (threshold) and 200% (maximum) of the target award opportunity established for each participant based on a performance curve of 95% of performance goal to 110% of performance goal. The failure to achieve the threshold performance level would result in the forfeiture of the entire opportunity. As noted above, the Compensation Committee believed that the target it established was rigorous yet achievable in light of our internal budget as well as the macroeconomic and industry environments at the time. 
The Compensation Committee has approved the use of an individual performance factor, based on such individual's performance during the prior year, which could result in an incremental increase or decrease in the annual cash incentive paid to such individual. The use of this factor allows such individual's manager to differentiate payouts based on a qualitative 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
assessment of performance against broader Company performance goals and objectives. More information about the application of this individual performance factor to the NEOs (other than Messrs. Pessina and Skinner, who do not receive annual cash incentives) can be found in "—IV. Annual Compensation—B. 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Payments—Individual Performance" below. 
B. 2018 Long-Term Compensation Target 
The Compensation Committee approved the use of cumulative adjusted EPS for the 2018-2020 performance period as the sole, absolute metric for measuring Company-wide performance for purposes of the performance share awards. 
Cumulative adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that refers to our GAAP diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted to reflect certain specified adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the Omnibus Incentive Plan, cumulated over the three-year period. As with adjusted operating income, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to adjust our GAAP earnings per share to help ensure that certain items that are non-operating or otherwise out of management's control do not impact payouts in either a positive or negative manner. 
The Compensation Committee believes that its use of the cumulative adjusted EPS metric is appropriate because it believes the metric correlates to stockholder value creation over a longer-term performance period and is a key indicator of our long-term profitability. For the NEOs (other than Mr. Skinner, who receives RSUs) and other corporate-level executives, results will be based on our consolidated performance, with no award tied to specific business unit results, which the Compensation Committee believes reinforces the need for collaboration among those executives. 
We do not publicly disclose our specific long-term compensation target due to the potential for competitive harm. The 2018-2020 target was set in relation to our three-year financial plan for the period, which was approved by the Board in October 2017. The Compensation Committee believed that the target it established was rigorous yet achievable in light of our internal forecast as well as the macroeconomic and industry environments at the time. 
If, during the three-year period, we fail to meet the threshold performance set by the Compensation Committee, then all performance shares subject to that award will be forfeited. Consequently, there is a risk that performance shares will be earned at less than 100% of the target amount or not at all. The following table illustrates the range of performance shares that can be earned under these awards depending on our performance during the 2018-2020 performance period:

IV. Annual Compensation 
A. 2018 Base Salary Decisions 
Neither Mr. Pessina nor Mr. Skinner received a base salary in 2018. For the other NEOs and our other senior executives, base salary is a key component of compensation, both on its own and because annual incentive awards are calculated based on salary. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
In October 2017, the Compensation Committee completed its annual review of market data and individual performance in connection with its consideration of 2018 base salary adjustments for the then-current NEOs (other than Messrs. Pessina and Skinner). At the conclusion of the review, the Compensation Committee approved the following base salary increases for these NEOs for 2018:

[END TABLE]
* Amounts were determined and paid in British Pounds Sterling and converted to U.S. Dollars at an exchange rate of approximately £1=$1.34736 (the average exchange rate during 2018 used by the Compensation Committee for purposes of executive compensation decisions). 
** Calculated on a constant currency basis. 
The base salary adjustments reflect the local market rates for each NEO. Mr. Kehoe's annual base salary of $900,000 was set consistent with market competitive rates for global chief financial officers as of the March 6, 2018 date of his offer letter. 
B. 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Payments 
For 2018, substantially all of our senior executives (including Ms. Barra and Messrs. Kehoe, Gourlay and Fairweather) were eligible to receive an annual cash incentive payment through the MIP. The MIP rewards executives for achieving key financial and non-financial goals at both the Company and individual levels, and is intended to align our senior executives' interests directly with our financial goals and leadership behaviors. 
As noted elsewhere in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section, neither Mr. Pessina nor Mr. Skinner receives a base salary and, therefore neither was eligible to receive cash incentive payments under the MIP in 2018. For the other senior executives (including the other NEOs), annual cash incentive payments were calculated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Base  Salary        X           Target Short-Term Incentive Opportunity%        X           Company Performance Against Annual Goals        =        Preliminary Cash Incentive Award Amount 
   Base  Salary        X           Target Short-Term Incentive Opportunity%        X           Company Performance Against Annual Goals        =        Preliminary Cash Incentive Award Amount 
   Base  Salary        X           Target Short-Term Incentive Opportunity%        X           Company Performance Against Annual Goals        =        Preliminary Cash Incentive Award Amount

                             Final Cash Incentive Award Amount   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee uses a two-step approach to determine the amount of annual cash incentive payments to be made under the MIP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The first step is to fund the overall cash incentive pool, which is funded if we meet a  pre-established performance metric established by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2011 Cash- 
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The second step is accomplished when the Compensation Committee exercises negative discretion by making adjustments to the  formula awarded by the overall pool. Negative discretion is used to reduce the amount funded by the pool to an amount equal to the target opportunity adjusted for final Company performance and individual performance, each as described below.   
[END TABLE]
Company Performance. As described further in "—III. Target Setting for Incentive Compensation—A. 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Target" above, the Compensation Committee approved the use of adjusted operating income as the sole, absolute metric for measuring Company performance for purposes of payment of annual cash incentive awards in 2018. 
The Compensation Committee retains the right under the MIP to adjust the results of adjusted operating income to exclude charges or items, such as those resulting from unusual or unpredictable events, from the measurement of performance. 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee used the same adjustments for purposes of reconciling adjusted operating income (which is a non-GAAP financial measures) to our operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as those we disclosed in our full year 2018 earnings release and related presentation on October 11, 2018. These consisted of adjustments to exclude acquisition-related amortization, certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements, acquisition-related costs, adjustments to our equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen Corporation, costs related to our store optimization program, the LIFO (last-in, first-out) inventory provision, hurricane-related costs and asset recovery. Additionally, the Compensation Committee adjusted for the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on adjusted operating income by translating current period adjusted operating income results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the same exchange rates used for the Board-approved budget for 2018, from which the adjusted operating income target for 2018 was derived. 
The Compensation Committee's approach to making these adjustments was unchanged from 2017. 
For 2018, the adjusted operating income target was set at $7,878 million, and the payout could range from 0% to 200% of target opportunity based on actual results. Upon completion of its review, the Compensation Committee approved the following results for 2018 and corresponding payout percentage under the MIP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Adjusted operating income         $7,483 million         $7,878 million         $8,665 million           $7,832 million*          89.1%**

[END TABLE]
* After currency translation adjustment. See Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement. 
** The payout percentage for WBA was reduced from the actual results of 94.1% to 89.1% to better align with payout percentages in the Company's divisions. 
A reconciliation of our 2018 adjusted operating income results approved by the Compensation Committee for purposes of the MIP to our 2018 operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP can be found in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement. 
Individual Performance. For 2018, the target cash incentive opportunity for each of the NEOs who participated in the MIP (Ms. Barra and Messrs. Kehoe, Gourlay and Fairweather) was 125% of her or his base salary. The target opportunity was determined by the Compensation Committee in consultation with Mercer and took into consideration, among other factors, market practice for each such NEO's specific role. 
In order to improve our ability to link pay and performance for our senior executives, including each of the NEOs who participated in the MIP (Ms. Barra and Messrs. Kehoe, Gourlay and Fairweather), the Compensation Committee authorized Mr. Skinner (with respect to Ms. Barra) and Mr. Pessina (with respect to all other senior executives, including Messrs. Kehoe, Gourlay and Fairweather) to recommend to the Compensation Committee, for its consideration and approval, adjustments to cash incentive award payments of up to 120% of the adjusted formula-driven MIP payout levels (subject to an aggregate maximum of 200% of target) or down to 0% of target. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
While the Compensation Committee relies heavily on objective, quantitative metrics to determine cash incentive payments under the MIP, this authorization allowed Messrs. Pessina and Skinner to conduct, and allowed the Compensation Committee to consider, an individual performance review that includes qualitative factors. This helps ensure the review is comprehensive and inclusive of individual, strategic, and leadership goals for which assessment is not solely dictated by numeric or formulaic applications. 
Messrs. Pessina and Skinner conducted this review at the end of 2018, taking into consideration each executive's individual performance relating to his or her business unit or area of responsibility, including the areas of strategy, leadership, and operating performance. Following this review, in October 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved individual adjustments to the 2018 cash incentive award payments under the MIP of 120% for each of Ms. Barra and Messrs. Gourlay and Fairweather. As Mr. Kehoe was new to his role and only participated in the plan for three months of the fiscal year, an adjustment of 115% was made for his individual performance to reflect his excellent performance during his tenure with the Company. 
Consequently, 2018 cash incentive payments to those NEOs were as follows:

A. 2018 Grants of Long-Term, Performance-Based Incentives 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee granted long-term incentive compensation to substantially all of our senior executives, including certain of our NEOs, in two forms of equity: performance shares (50% of award value) and non-qualified stock options (50% of award value). Each of these forms of equity further aligns our executives' interests with those of our stockholders and provides retention incentives through multi-year vesting periods. Long-term incentive compensation is granted annually under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Mr. Kehoe did not receive an award for 2018 based on the date he joined the Company. 
In 2018, these awards were based on a fixed dollar amount of target economic value rather than as a percent of salary target. This approach provides for the same value of awards for executives at the same level regardless of salary. Consistent with prior years, the number of shares subject to each award type was based on the average closing price of a share of our 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
common stock over the last 30 trading days of 2017 so as to diminish the impact of short-term fluctuations, positive or negative, in our stock price on award sizes. 
While we describe the 2018 performance-based compensation in this "V. Long-Term Compensation" section as it applies to Ms. Barra and Messrs. Kehoe, Gourlay and Fairweather, the description is also generally applicable to Mr. Pessina's performance-based compensation. It is not, however, applicable to the at-risk compensation awarded to Mr. Skinner in 2018. For more information regarding Messrs. Pessina and Skinner's compensation, see "—VI. CEO and Executive Chairman Compensation" below. 
B. 2018 Performance Share Award Grants 
In October 2017, the Compensation Committee granted 50% of the target dollar amount of the total long-term, performance-based incentive award for eligible senior executives for 2018 in the form of performance shares. Performance shares are a form of equity compensation tied to the achievement of a specific performance goal or goals that are linked to our long-term performance. Each performance share represents the right to receive, if and to the extent the designated performance goal within the period is satisfied, a share of our common stock following completion of the three-year performance period. 
For the 2018 performance share awards, the Compensation Committee decided that the sole performance metric would be cumulative adjusted EPS over the 2018-2020 performance period. The payout can range from 0% to 150% for the 2018-2020 performance period based on actual results. See "—III. Target Setting for Incentive Compensation—B. 2018 Long-Term Compensation Target" above for more information. 
The table below shows information regarding the performance shares granted to each of our NEOs (other than Mr. Pessina) who received performance share awards in 2018.

A description of Mr. Pessina's 2018 performance share award is set forth in "—VI. CEO and Executive Chairman Compensation—A. 2018 CEO Compensation" below. Messrs. Skinner and Kehoe did not receive performance share awards in 2018. 
C. 2018 Stock Option Grants 
In October 2017, the Compensation Committee granted the remaining 50% of the target dollar amount of the 2018 total long-term, performance-based incentive award in the form of stock options. 
For 2018, the terms of the NEO stock option grants were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All stock options granted are non-qualified stock options.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options vest in one-third annual increments commencing on the one-year anniversary of the grant, and expire 10 years  after the grant date (with special rules covering the various types of termination of employment that might occur during the vesting period or thereafter).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options do not receive dividends.  
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options are granted at an exercise price of no less than fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant  date. Accordingly, stock options only provide value to the recipients if our share price increases following the grant date, and provide no realizable value to recipients if our share price does not increase.  
[END TABLE]
As part of its efforts to further increase the role of individual performance in compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee applied an individual performance factor, based on such individual's performance during the prior year, which could result in an incremental increase or decrease in the target economic value of the stock options granted to such individual. 
At the end of 2017, each of Messrs. Pessina and Skinner conducted an evaluation of the contribution of each member of his respective management team in the areas of strategy, leadership, and operating performance as it relates to our long-term goals. Based in part on their assessment of each such executive's contribution, for 2018, Mr. Pessina (with respect to Messrs. Fairweather and Gourlay) and Mr. Skinner (with respect to Ms. Barra) recommended to the Compensation Committee individual increases of 20% over the target number of stock options granted in 2018. These adjustments were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and were made, in part, to recognize the future potential of each of these senior executives. 
The table below shows information regarding the stock options granted to each of our NEOs (other than Mr. Pessina) who received stock options in 2018. We used a Black-Scholes valuation model, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock over the last 30 trading days of 2017, to determine the number of stock options granted.

[END TABLE]
D. Payout of 2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
In October 2015, performance shares were granted to our senior executives for the 2016-2018 performance period. The performance shares had a performance period of September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2018 and were contingent on the Company achieving its three-year cumulative adjusted EPS goals. The goals were set aggressively and designed to be challenging for the following three-year period. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The following chart sets forth the financial performance measure, performance period, the performance goals and corresponding payouts as a percentage of the target performance share opportunity for the fiscal 2016-2018 performance share cycle: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Measure     Performance Level    Fiscal 2016- 2018 Goal     Performance (as a% of Target)% of Performance Shares Earned* 
 Performance Measure     Performance Level    Fiscal 2016- 2018 Goal     Performance (as a% of Target)% of Performance Shares Earned* 
 Cumulative Adjusted EPS    Below Threshold:    <$13.84    <95%    0% of target grant 
[END TABLE]
* Performance between threshold and target, or between target and maximum, will earn performance shares on a straight line pro-rated basis between 50% and 100% or between 100% and 150%, respectively. 
In October 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the three-year cumulative adjusted EPS goal for the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period was exceeded at $15.71. The Compensation Committee used the same adjustments to earnings per share as those we disclosed in our full year 2016, 2017 and 2018 earnings releases and related presentations. As a result, the Compensation Committee determined that the fiscal 2016-2018 performance shares had been earned at 139.2% of target and approved the resulting performance share vesting levels for the NEOs who had received such performance shares, as follows: Mr. Pessina, 90,605 shares; Ms. Barra, 26,426 shares; Mr. Gourlay, 26,426 shares; and Mr. Fairweather, 26,426 shares. 
VI. CEO and Executive Chairman Compensation 
As noted elsewhere in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section, unlike the other NEOs, substantially all of the compensation paid to Messrs. Pessina and Skinner in 2018 is in the form of equity-based awards, which is designed to align their compensation to stockholder value. Neither Mr. Pessina nor Mr. Skinner received a base salary in 2018 or was eligible to receive a cash incentive award for 2018. 
A. 2018 CEO Compensation 
Mr. Pessina is, through an affiliated entity, our largest stockholder. Consequently, the Compensation Committee believes (after consultation with Mercer) that providing Mr. Pessina with substantially all of his compensation in the form of equity-based awards, using the same equal split of performance shares and stock options as provided to our other senior executives, is appropriate and consistent with current market practice for similarly-situated executives, and closely aligns his compensation with the interests of our stockholders. 
For 2018, in consideration of his service as our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Pessina a combination of performance shares and stock options equal in total economic value to $15 million. The year-over-year increase in the value of Mr. Pessina's 2018 equity award was in recognition of Mr. Pessina's importance to the Company and his strong performance in 2017, as well as the Compensation Committee's desire to better align the value of his compensation to the peer group median for Chief Executive Officers. 
The number of performance shares and stock options granted to Mr. Pessina was determined using the same methodology used for other senior executives as described in "—V. Long-Term Compensation" above. 
The performance shares awarded to Mr. Pessina are subject to the terms and conditions described in "—V. Long-Term Compensation—B. 2018 Performance Share Award Grants" above, including the three-year performance period. The stock options awarded to Mr. Pessina will vest in one-third increments on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date and are otherwise subject to the terms and conditions described in "—V. Long-Term Compensation—C. 2018 Stock Option Grants" above. The performance shares and stock options are subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances, or full or pro-rated accelerated vesting in certain circumstances, including if Mr. Pessina ceases to serve on the Board (subject 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
to certain exceptions). For a discussion of the circumstances related to forfeiture or to full or pro-rated accelerated vesting of Mr. Pessina's outstanding awards, see "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below.

* Calculated based on the probable satisfaction of the performance conditions for such award as of the date of grant. 
B. 2018 Executive Chairman Compensation 
Similarly, the Compensation Committee believes (after consultation with Mercer) that providing Mr. Skinner with substantially all of his compensation in the form of time-based RSUs is appropriate and consistent with current market practice for the compensation of executive chairs, and closely aligns his compensation with the interests of our stockholders. 
For 2018, in consideration of his service as our Executive Chairman, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Skinner an RSU award equal in total economic value to $7.5 million. The year-over-year increase in the value of Mr. Skinner's 2018 equity award was to better align the value of his compensation to market rates. The number of RSUs granted was determined by dividing the grant value by the average closing price of our common stock over the last 30 trading days of 2017. This award will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and is subject to forfeiture or full or pro-rated accelerated vesting in certain circumstances, including if Mr. Skinner ceases to serve on the Board (subject to certain exceptions). For a discussion of the circumstances related to forfeiture or to full or pro-rated accelerated vesting of Mr. Skinner's outstanding awards, see "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below.

[END TABLE]
VII. Executive Compensation Program Updates for 2019 
As noted in "—I. Executive Summary—B. Components of our 2018 Executive Compensation Program" above, at the 2018 Annual Meeting, our say-on-pay proposal received the support of approximately 93.5% of the votes cast, and received the support of at least 95% of the votes cast at our 2017 and 2016 annual meetings of stockholders. The Board and the Compensation Committee considered these votes, as well as feedback received during individual meetings with stockholders, as demonstrating strong support for our executive compensation program as currently designed. 
Consequently, for 2019, the Compensation Committee has decided to maintain the core structure of our executive compensation program as described in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. In particular, the Compensation Committee authorized the use of adjusted operating income as the sole financial metric for measuring Company performance for 2019 cash incentive award payments, and the use of cumulative adjusted EPS for the 2019-2021 performance period as the sole financial metric for measuring Company performance for 2019 performance share awards. Consistent with prior years, Messrs. Pessina and Skinner did not receive a base salary for 2019 (and thus are ineligible for 2019 cash incentive awards), and will solely be compensated for their service during the year in the form of equity-based awards similar to 2018. 
While the Compensation Committee retained the core structure of our executive compensation program in 2019, the Compensation Committee did approve revisions to the mix of forms of equity used in the LTIP program and the retirement provisions applicable to LTIP awards. The total economic value of the 2019 awards will be provided 30% in stock options and 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
70% in performance shares (compared to 50% stock options and 50% performance shares in 2018). In addition, for eligible employees who retire from the Company after age 55 with at least 10 years of service, the retirement provisions for LTIP awards beginning with the 2019 grants will be: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All unvested stock options will vest fully upon retirement and can be exercised until the end of the applicable term; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Outstanding performance shares will vest pro-rata based on the number of months  completed in a performance period and will settle based on actual Company performance at the end of the performance period.  
[END TABLE]
Further, consistent with current market practice, beginning in 2019, the change in control provisions for stock option awards will provide that eligible employees who have a qualifying termination of employment within one year following a change in control have the full remaining 10-year term to exercise stock options that vest prior to or upon such qualifying termination. 
VIII. Retirement and Other Benefits 
A. Retirement Plans and Programs 
Mr. Gourlay has accrued benefits in the Boots Pension Plan, which covers certain employees in the United Kingdom, as well as in two smaller defined benefits plans, the Boots Supplementary Pension Plan and the Boots Additional Pension Arrangement. The Boots Pension Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing a retirement pension and a dependent's pension on the death of the participant. The Boots Pension Plan was closed to future accruals effective June 30, 2010, with benefits calculated by reference to pensionable salaries as of that date. The plan is subject to an actuarial funding valuation on a triennial basis. The Boots Supplementary Pension Plan and the Boots Additional Pension Arrangement were also closed to future accruals effective June 30, 2010. 
In lieu of further participation in a defined contribution scheme, Ms. Barra and Messrs. Fairweather and Gourlay receive a pension supplement of 40% of base salary, which the Compensation Committee believes is consistent with relevant market practice. 
B. Perquisites 
We provide our NEOs and other senior executives with perquisites and other personal benefits that we believe are non-excessive and competitive with those offered by companies comparable to us. In April 2018, in consultation with Mercer, the Compensation Committee conducted a review of these perquisites and other personal benefits and determined that they remained generally consistent with relevant market practice. 
Aircraft Usage. Pursuant to our guidelines for aircraft usage, we permit the personal use of our aircraft by each of Messrs. Pessina and Skinner. We also allow his partner or spouse, as applicable, to accompany him on such personal trips (in addition to accompanying him on business trips). In limited circumstances, pre-approved personal use of our aircraft by other senior executives is also permitted. 
The Compensation Committee has authorized each of Mr. Pessina and Mr. Skinner, during the time he serves as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, respectively, to use our aircraft without requiring reimbursement for up to 20 flight hours per year for personal travel. During 2018, Mr. Pessina did not exceed that limit and Mr. Skinner did not utilize the Company's aircraft for personal travel. From time to time during 2018, Mr. Pessina and Ms. Barra chartered our aircraft for his or her personal use. In such cases, they did so through a third-party chartering service on an arm's-length basis, and in doing so indirectly paid us market rates for his or her personal use of such aircraft. 
Each of Mr. Pessina and Mr. Skinner, to the extent his use of our aircraft for personal travel exceeds the number of hours per year allowed by the Compensation Committee without reimbursement, and our other senior executives who use our aircraft for personal travel, are required to reimburse us, pursuant to an aircraft time-sharing agreement consistent with Federal 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Aviation Administration regulations, an amount intended to approximate our incremental cost of such travel. To the extent either Mr. Pessina's or Mr. Skinner's use of our aircraft for personal travel without the need to reimburse us constitutes taxable income to him under applicable tax laws, then he pays the taxes on such income without gross-ups. 
Relocation and Related Benefits. Executive officers are eligible for certain relocation and related benefits if they are assigned to work in a country that is not their "home country" (as defined in the applicable policy). In addition, Mr. Kehoe received relocation payments and benefits in connection with his initial hiring, the value and description of which is included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. In addition to certain other benefits described in the paragraph below, each of Mr. Fairweather and Mr. Gourlay is entitled to a company car; payment of certain costs associated with his life, health, and other insurance policies (including, in some cases, coverage for his spouse and dependent children); long-term disability coverage; and a guaranteed death-in-service benefit of five times base salary. If either of these executives declines a particular benefit (other than the death-in-service benefit), then he may receive a cash payment in lieu thereof. Each also receives certain tax equalization benefits and tax assistance (as described further below in "—C. Employment Agreements") consistent with his expatriate assignment. 
Other. We provide limited additional perquisites and other personal benefits to our NEOs and other senior executives, including an annual medical examination, limited reimbursement of health club dues, long-term disability and personal accident insurance, preferred flight status within certain airline programs, and tax preparation services for executives with tax obligations in multiple countries. The perquisites and other benefits we provided to our NEOs during 2018 are further quantified in the footnotes in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. 
C. Employment Agreements 
Stefano Pessina. We entered into an employment offer letter with Mr. Pessina, effective January 9, 2015, in connection with his hiring as our then-interim Chief Executive Officer. This offer letter was approved by the Compensation Committee and executed on April 7, 2015. This offer letter has no specified term and supersedes all previous employment arrangements between Mr. Pessina and affiliates of Alliance Boots. As noted above, Mr. Pessina receives equity awards in connection with his service as our Chief Executive Officer, but he does not receive a base salary and therefore is ineligible for any annual incentive awards. Mr. Pessina may receive certain additional limited benefits in accordance with our executive compensation program, consistent with his role and status, such as being covered by our personal accident and travel insurance benefits. This offer letter was filed as an exhibit to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we filed with the SEC on April 9, 2015. 
James A. Skinner. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Skinner. 
James Kehoe. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Kehoe. However, we entered into an employment offer letter with Mr. Kehoe, following approval by the Compensation Committee, effective as of March 6, 2018. The letter has no specified term, and his employment is on an at-will basis. Under the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Kehoe's initial annualized base salary is $900,000 and his target annual cash incentive opportunity is 125% of his base salary (prorated in the case of fiscal year 2018) under the MIP. Mr. Kehoe is eligible to participate in our LTIP providing for annual stock option and performance share grants, with the total combined target grant date award value for this position as of the date of his offer letter being $3.5 million. Mr. Kehoe is also covered by the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan discussed below under "—D. Change of Control Agreements." He also received relocation benefits in accordance with our policy and other employee benefits consistent with those received by our other U.S.-based senior executives and as otherwise set forth in his offer letter. In part to compensate Mr. Kehoe for compensation foregone at his prior employer, he also received a (i) $2.5 million cash sign-on bonus, which was payable as to 50% within 30 calendar days of the first day of his employment and as to the remaining 50% within 30 calendar days of the first anniversary of his employment, and (ii) a one-time RSU grant, all as further described under "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. Each installment of the cash sign-on bonus is subject to a one-year clawback, such that the installment must be repaid in full by Mr. Kehoe if he resigns or is terminated for cause during the one-year period following the date such installment becomes payable. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The other NEOs were employed by Alliance Boots or its subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Second Step Transaction, and have employment agreements from such time that continue to be in effect until terminated. These employment agreements were filed as exhibits to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we filed with the SEC on April 9, 2015. Formal employment agreements are a competitive market practice in the United Kingdom, where Messrs. Fairweather and Gourlay were residents when they entered into their respective employment agreements; and in Monaco, where Ms. Barra was a resident when she entered into her employment agreement. 
Ornella Barra. Benefits provided to Ms. Barra pursuant to her agreement are described above in "—B. Perquisites" and in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. Ms. Barra's agreement provides for a 12-month notice period prior to termination of employment by either Ms. Barra or us, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreement. We also provide, at our expense, annual tax advice from external tax advisors relating to U.S. tax returns in relation to Ms. Barra's employment with us. 
Alexander W. Gourlay. In September 2013, Walgreens entered into a Secondment Agreement (the "Secondment Agreement") with Alliance Boots Management Services Limited, an affiliate of Alliance Boots, pursuant to which Alliance Boots may second certain of its employees to Walgreens for particular assignments. Since 2013, Mr. Gourlay has been seconded to Walgreens pursuant to the Secondment Agreement and an assignment letter, which was most recently extended in October 2018. 
Mr. Gourlay also has an employment agreement that remains in effect. Benefits provided to Mr. Gourlay pursuant to his employment agreement are described above in "—B. Perquisites" and in "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below, and include cost of living and housing allowances, expenses associated with annual tax advice from external tax advisors related to Mr. Gourlay's employment with us, tax equalization benefits, and reimbursement of the difference between his real estate liability in the U.S. and his liability in the United Kingdom. Mr. Gourlay's agreement provides for a 12-month notice period prior to termination of employment by either Mr. Gourlay or us, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreement, and also provides for the payment of redundancy payments in certain circumstances. 
George R. Fairweather. Benefits provided to Mr. Fairweather pursuant to his agreement are described above in "—B. Perquisites" and in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information" below. We entered into a Contract Amendment with Mr. Fairweather effective as of March 6, 2018. Pursuant to the Contract Amendment, Mr. Fairweather became senior advisor to our Chief Executive Officer for business development and finance matters effective June 1, 2018, and continued as an employee of the Company on a full-time basis until June 30, 2018 (the "Transition Date") and on a reduced basis thereafter. Prior to the Transition Date, Mr. Fairweather continued to receive the same compensation and benefits as he previously received as Chief Financial Officer. Following the Transition Date, Mr. Fairweather receives an annualized base salary of £210,347 (approximately $292,300 based on exchange rates as of March 6, 2018) in lieu of his previous salary to reflect a reduction in days worked to 65 per year, and he will remain eligible to participate in our LTIP providing for stock option and performance share grants, subject to pro-ration of such grants to account for Mr. Fairweather's reduced work schedule. Mr. Fairweather's target annual cash incentive opportunity under the MIP for 2018 was based on his base salary in effect prior to the Transition Date, and in future fiscal years will be based on his base salary in effect after the Transition Date, subject to adjustment in accordance with the amendment. His pay in lieu of pension calculation is amended to reflect his reduced base salary after the Transition Date and his car allowance is pro-rated. The Contract Amendment also reduces the notice period prior to termination from 12 months to 3 months. 
Additionally, on October 28, 2015, we entered into a Corporate Travel and Expense Support Letter Agreement with Mr. Fairweather, which was filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed with the SEC on October 28, 2015. This agreement provides certain support for Mr. Fairweather in connection with his business travel in his capacity as one of our senior executives. Specifically, it provides that we will pay the amount of taxes incurred as a result of certain business travel and related subsistence and accommodation expenses that exceeds the amount of taxes that Mr. Fairweather would have incurred if not for such business travel. We will also provide, at our expense, annual tax advice from external tax advisors relating to both U.S. and United Kingdom tax returns in relation to Mr. Fairweather's employment with us. This arrangement remains unchanged by the Contract Amendment. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
D. Change in Control Agreements 
We maintain the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan (the "CIC Plan"), which provides eligible executives certain severance benefits (a) upon an involuntary termination by us at any time (other than for cause or upon death or disability, as those terms are defined in the CIC Plan) or (b) within one year following a "change in control," upon an involuntary termination or a voluntary termination for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the CIC Plan). 
The CIC Plan contains a double-trigger feature with respect to a change in control, meaning that the CIC Plan requires both a change in control and a qualifying termination of employment within one year following the change in control in order to receive severance benefits. 
None of the NEOs except Mr. Kehoe is currently eligible for benefits under the CIC Plan, as (1) Mr. Pessina does not receive any salary or annual incentive payments and therefore would receive no severance benefits under the CIC Plan, (2) Mr. Skinner, as Executive Chairman, is not currently eligible for participation in the CIC Plan, and (3) the other NEOs (except for Mr. Kehoe) would receive benefits pursuant to their individual employment agreements in lieu of benefits under the CIC Plan. 
Mr. Kehoe's benefits under the CIC Plan and the other NEOs' benefits under their individual employment agreements are described under "—Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information—Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
IX. Other Matters 
A. Compensation Risk Oversight 
In 2016, the Compensation Committee retained Mercer to conduct a risk review of our compensation programs and assess whether any of our incentive compensation plans, either individually or in the aggregate, would encourage our executives or employees to undertake unnecessary or inappropriate risks that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on us. The Compensation Committee reviewed this external risk assessment of our variable pay plans and considered several factors, including the type of plan; the number of participants in each plan; the participants' levels within the organization; the target and maximum payout potential, and performance criteria under each plan; and risk mitigating controls in place for each plan. 
As part of these assessments, our management and the Compensation Committee, as well as Mercer, evaluated those plans that were identified as having the potential to deliver a significant amount of compensation, which included the short-term and long-term incentive programs described elsewhere in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. 
The Compensation Committee thereafter concluded that it was not reasonably likely that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices would have a material adverse effect on us due to a variety of factors. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation programs are designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation programs are balanced between a variety of different measures, and both short-term and long-term incentives  are designed to reward execution of our short-term and long-term corporate strategies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We allocate compensation among base salary, annual cash incentives, and long-term incentives, such as stock options and  performance shares, that include both time of service and performance-based criteria;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual cash incentive component involves cash-based plan awards that are payable if, and only to the extent that, pre-established Company-wide financial and individual performance objectives are achieved;  
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation includes components that are paid based on results averaged out over a number of years and  that vest over an extended period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executives are required to own a specified level of shares in order to comply with the stock ownership guidelines described  in "—B. Stock Ownership Guidelines" below, which encourages focusing on enhancing long-term stockholder value in a sustainable manner;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As described below under "—C. Compensation Recovery (Clawback) Policy," we have adopted a  "clawback" policy applicable to all officers that is designed to allow us to recover incentive compensation paid if there is a restatement of financial results or misconduct, including fraud;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As described below under "—D. Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies," we have a policy that prohibits  directors and executives from participating in transactions designed to hedge or speculate on any change in our stock price ensuring that, as designed, directors and executives bear the full risk of their ownership of our securities; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have incentive programs that provide the Compensation Committee with discretion to make downward adjustments to certain  payments or awards under the component programs.  
[END TABLE]
In light of the absence of any significant changes in our executive compensation program between 2017 and 2018, the Compensation Committee continues to believe that it is not reasonably likely that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices would have a material adverse effect on us, primarily for the same reasons set forth above. 
B. Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board first adopted executive stock ownership guidelines in 2008. Under the current guidelines, each senior executive has five years from the date of election or appointment to his or her position to achieve the lesser of the fixed or variable ownership level associated with his or her position. The minimum stock ownership guidelines for our Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Level      Fixed Number of Shares      Variable Number of     Shares*       
 Executive Level      Fixed Number of Shares      Variable Number of     Shares*       
 Executive Level      Fixed Number of Shares      Variable Number of     Shares*       
   Executive Chairman      230,000      5x Salary       
   Executive Chairman      230,000      5x Salary       
   Chief Executive Officer      230,000      5x Salary       
   Chief Executive Officer      230,000      5x Salary       
   Chief Operating Officer      130,000      4x Salary       
   Chief Operating Officer      130,000      4x Salary       
   Chief Operating Officer      130,000      4x Salary       
   Executive Vice President      60,000      3x Salary       
   Executive Vice President      60,000      3x Salary       
   Senior Vice President      30,000      2x Salary       
   Senior Vice President      30,000      2x Salary       
[END TABLE]
* Variable number of shares equals stated salary multiple divided by share price as of the measurement date. 
The following are included in determining stock ownership for purposes of these guidelines (to the extent applicable): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock and RSUs, discounted by an assumed tax rate of 35% and only up to 50% of the applicable ownership target;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares held by minor dependents and spouses; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares owned outright, such as shares acquired upon the vesting of performance shares and the exercise of stock options.   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviewed our executives' progress towards meeting these guidelines in October 2018. Using reasonable assumptions regarding executive salary and stock price appreciation, the Compensation Committee concluded that each of the NEOs has either met the stock ownership requirement applicable to him or her or is progressing towards meeting such requirement within the appropriate time frame. 
More information about the stock ownership guidelines applicable to Non-Employee Directors can be found in "Director Compensation—Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines" above. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
C. Compensation Recovery (Clawback) Policy 
The Board has adopted a compensation recovery, or "clawback," policy for cash and equity incentive awards paid to executive officers. If there is a restatement of financial results, then the policy allows the Compensation Committee to seek reimbursement of the incremental portion of awards paid to executive officers in excess of the awards that would have been paid based on the restated financial results. All forms of incentive compensation are subject to this policy. The Compensation Committee may look back over the three-year period prior to the restatement for the recoupment, and may also look to current and former executive officers. 
The policy provides the Compensation Committee with the discretion to recoup amounts of excess incentive compensation paid to an officer in conjunction with any materially incorrect results (even if not resulting in a restatement), or misconduct on the part of the executive officer, including fraud or other conduct that would lead to a "for cause" termination (as defined in the Company's clawback policy). 
In addition to this policy, our Chief Executive Officer and Global Chief Financial Officer are subject to any clawbacks that may be required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
D. Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies 
We have adopted, as part of our insider trading policy, prohibitions on the short sale of our common stock and other securities as well as the purchase or sale of financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our common stock or other securities. These policies prohibit our directors, officers, and senior employees, including each of the NEOs, from hedging the risk of their ownership of our common stock. 
This policy also prohibits our directors, officers, and senior employees, including each of the NEOs, from pledging our common stock or other securities as collateral for a loan without the prior written approval of our Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel and our Corporate Secretary. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The following Compensation Committee Report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing we may make under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, notwithstanding any general statement contained in any such filing incorporating this Proxy Statement by reference, except to the extent we incorporate such report by specific reference. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis on behalf of the Board. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. 
Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above be included in this Proxy Statement and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.

Executive Compensation Tables and Supporting Information 
2018 Summary Compensation Table 
The following table shows information regarding the compensation of each NEO for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (other than for Mr. Kehoe, who joined the Company in 2018). The values shown represent each NEO's compensation during the fiscal year, including the grant date fair value of equity awards that were granted during a fiscal year that vest in a future year, subject to the terms and conditions of each award. 
Certain amounts paid to or earned by certain NEOs were paid or accrued in British Pounds Sterling. In the tables below, amounts for 2018 (other than the pension value calculations, as noted in footnote 4 below) were converted to U.S. Dollars at an exchange rate of approximately £1=$1.34736 (the average exchange rate during 2018 used by the Compensation Committee for purposes of executive compensation decisions).

    * Mr. Kehoe joined the Company effective June 1, 2018. 
➊ This amount represents the first installment of Mr. Kehoes sign-on bonus. As described above under VIII. Retirement and Other BenefitsC. Employment Agreements, Mr. Kehoes $2,500,000 sign-on bonus is paid in two equal installments of $1,250,000 within 30 days following Mr. Kehoes first day of employment and within 30 days following the one-year anniversary of his first day of employment, in each case, subject to a clawback requirement such that each installment must be repaid in full by Mr. Kehoe if he resigns or is terminated for cause during the one-year period following the date such installment becomes payable. 
➋ Represents the aggregate grant date fair value, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of RSUs (for Mr. Kehoe and Mr. Skinner) and performance shares (for the other NEOs) granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan during the applicable fiscal year. These values do not represent amounts paid to or realized by the applicable NEO. The amounts included for the performance shares granted during 2018 are calculated based on the probable satisfaction of the performance conditions for such awards and the price of our common stock as of the date of grant. Assuming the highest level of performance is achieved for the performance shares, the maximum value at the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Pessina: $9,343,774; Ms. Barra: $2,491,666; Mr. Gourlay: $2,491,666; and Mr. Fairweather: $2,491,666. See Compensation 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION 
Discussion and Analysis—V. Long-Term Compensation—B. 2018 Performance Share Award Grants" above for further information regarding these awards. For additional information regarding our stock compensation plans, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Report"). Stock awards that remained outstanding as of August 31, 2018 are reflected in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table below. 
➌ Represents the grant date fair value, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of stock options granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan during the applicable fiscal year. These values do not represent amounts paid to or realized by the applicable NEO. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis above for further information regarding these awards. The fair value of each option granted in 2018 was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with weighted-average assumptions of: risk-free interest rate (U.S. Treasury security rates for the expected term of the option), 2.03%; average expected life of options, 6.3 years; volatility (based on historical and implied volatility of the Companys common stock), 25.30%; dividend yield (the Companys cash dividend for the expected term), 2.03%; and weighted average grant date fair value (granted at market price), $14.27. For additional information regarding our stock compensation plans, see Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2018 Annual Report. Stock options that remained outstanding as of August 31, 2018 are reflected in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table below. 
➍ Includes the annual incentive compensation earned for each fiscal year (or portion thereof) pursuant to the MIP. 
➎ Reflects changes in pension value. For Mr. Gourlay, the 2018 amount represents the pension value in U.S. Dollars as of the end of 2018, using the exchange rate at that time (£1=$1.2968), minus the pension value in U.S. Dollars as of the end of 2017, using the exchange rate at that time (£1=$1.2869). The amount shown is zero, because there was a negative change in value of $177,161. Ms. Barra received a full distribution of her pension benefit in February 2017.

  Includes cash payment in lieu of participation in a defined contribution plan. 
  For Messrs. Fairweather and Gourlay, includes a car allowance (or cash payment in lieu thereof) and for Mr. Fairweather, private medical insurance. For Mr. Kehoe, includes the Company's incremental costs relating to long-term disability benefits and personal accident insurance benefits. The amount for Mr. Pessina reflects his personal use of the Company's aircraft. The Company determines the amount associated with personal use of its aircraft by calculating the incremental cost to it by multiplying the aircraft's hourly variable operating cost by a trip's flight time, which includes any flight time of an empty return flight. Variable operating costs include: (1) landing, parking, passenger ground transportation, crew travel and flight planning services expenses; (2) supplies, catering and crew traveling expenses; (3) aircraft fuel and oil expenses; (4) maintenance, parts and external labor (inspections and repairs); and (5) any customs, foreign permit and similar fees. Fixed costs that do not vary based upon usage are not included in the calculation of direct operating cost. 
  Pursuant to SEC rules, perquisites and personal benefits are not reported for any NEO for whom such amounts were less than $10,000 in the aggregate for 2018.

Pension Benefits 
The following table shows information regarding the estimated present value of accumulated pension benefits for Mr. Gourlay. 
In connection with the Second Step Transaction, the Company assumed certain of Alliance Boots' defined benefit pension plans. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan, which covers certain employees in the United Kingdom. The Boots Pension Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing a retirement pension and a dependent's pension on the death of the participant. The Boots Pension Plan was closed to future accruals effective June 30, 2010, with benefits calculated by reference to pensionable salaries as of that date. The plan is subject to an actuarial funding valuation on a triennial basis. 
The Company also assumed two smaller defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, the Boots Supplementary Pension Plan and the Boots Additional Pension Arrangement, both of which were also closed to future accruals effective June 30, 2010. These plans were intended to supplement the benefits provided under the Boots Pension Plan for eligible senior employees of Alliance Boots. 
Benefits under these plans are payable upon retirement (age 60 under all plans) or death or, in certain cases, upon early retirement. Participants in the Boots Pension Plan and Boots Supplementary Pension Plan have the option of receiving a portion of their pension as a tax-free cash sum upon retirement. Participants in the Boots Additional Pension Arrangement are

paid their benefit as a single lump sum. Even though these plans are closed to future accruals, the present value of accumulated benefits can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on changes in the underlying actuarial pension assumptions. Other than Mr. Gourlay, no other NEO is currently a participant in these plans or any other defined benefit plan of the Company.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The information below describes the compensation and benefits payable to each of the NEOs in the event of termination of his or her employment as of August 31, 2018. The actual amounts to be paid under any of the scenarios can only be determined at the time of such NEO's separation from the Company. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to provide additional benefits to senior executives upon termination or resignation if it believes the circumstances so warrant. 
Upon termination of employment for any reason, each NEO will be entitled to receive amounts earned during his or her employment. These amounts may include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any earned awards that are not yet paid, including unpaid approved awards under the MIP for the completed fiscal year and  unpaid vested performance share awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan for the completed fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vested stock options;

• Earned but unused vacation pay and paid time off; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary earned through the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
Unless otherwise noted, the information below also does not include amounts earned for 2018 that are shown in "2018 Summary Compensation Table" above. 
Mr. Pessina. Mr. Pessina's sole compensation in 2016, 2017 and 2018 consisted of the performance share and stock option awards issued in 2016, 2017 and 2018, in each case as reflected in "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table above. Upon termination of his employment as of August 31, 2018, the exclusive benefits provided to Mr. Pessina would be: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event of Mr. Pessina's disability or death, he would receive full accelerated vesting of all of these  performance share and stock option awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event Mr. Pessina's employment is terminated within one year after a change in control of the Company  (other than for cause), he would receive full accelerated vesting of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock option awards and the 2016 performance share awards, and pro-rated vesting of the 2017 and 2018 performance  share awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event Mr. Pessina resigns from the Board, he would receive full vesting of the 2016 and 2017 performance share  and stock option awards; and pro-rated vesting of the 2018 performance share and stock option awards.  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION 
In each case except for termination following a change in control, the actual performance shares earned will be based on the Company's performance and settled at the end of the performance period. In the event of termination within one year following a change in control, the pro-rated performance shares are payable at target and settled within 45 days of termination of service. 
Mr. Pessina is also technically eligible to participate in the CIC Plan; however, because he has no annual salary and does not participate in the MIP, he would not be entitled to benefits under the plan in the event of termination of his employment upon a change in control of the Company. 
Mr. Skinner. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Skinner's sole compensation in 2016, 2017 and 2018 consisted of the RSU awards issued in those years, in each case as reflected in "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table above. Mr. Skinner does not participate in any of the Company's employee benefit plans, including the CIC Plan. 
As a result, upon termination of his employment as of August 31, 2018 due to disability, death, retirement from the Board, or termination of employment within one year after a change in control of the Company (other than for cause), the exclusive benefit provided to Mr. Skinner would be full vesting of these RSU awards; provided, however, that the RSU award granted in November 2017 would vest on a pro-rated basis if retirement occurs within twelve months of the grant date, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions. 
Mr. Kehoe. Mr. Kehoe does not have an employment agreement, but is eligible to participate in the Company's employment benefit plans, including the CIC Plan, under which he would receive severance benefits (a) of $4,050,000 upon an involuntary termination by us at any time (other than for cause or upon death or disability, as those terms are defined in the CIC Plan) or (b) of $5,062,500 upon an involuntary termination or a voluntary termination for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the CIC Plan) within one year following a "change in control". In addition, upon termination of his employment as of August 31, 2018 due to disability, death, or termination of employment within one year after a change in control of the Company (other than for cause), Mr. Kehoe's RSU award reflected in "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table above would become fully vested. Under all other scenarios, these RSUs would be forfeited. 
Other NEOs. Each of Ms. Barra and Messrs. Fairweather and Gourlay has an employment agreement that sets forth potential payments to be made upon qualifying termination events. Because of the existence of these employment agreements, none of these NEOs is eligible for benefits under the CIC Plan. Certain amounts described herein would be paid in British Pounds Sterling; amounts shown in U.S. Dollars are based on the average exchange rate during 2018 used by the Compensation Committee for purposes of executive compensation decisions of £1=$1.34736. 
Ms. Barra may be terminated for cause (as specified in her employment agreement) and would receive no payments. Termination by the Company not for cause or resignation by Ms. Barra requires twelve months' notice; accordingly, Ms. Barra would be entitled to her base salary and all other compensation and benefits during this notice period; provided, however, that the Company may terminate Ms. Barra's employment immediately and pay in monthly installments through the end of the notice period a total of £1,005,784 ($1,355,153), which represents base salary and cash payments in lieu of participation in a defined contribution plan (i.e., pension supplement). No additional payments would be made to Ms. Barra should her termination occur in connection with a change in control. In the event of a termination due to permanent disability or death as a result of an accident, Ms. Barra would receive three times her base salary pursuant to a personal accident insurance policy, which equals £2,155,251 ($2,903,899). Upon death while employed, a lump sum death benefit of £3,592,085 ($4,839,832) would be payable (pursuant to a life insurance policy paid for by the Company), which represents five times Ms. Barra's base salary. 
Mr. Gourlay may be terminated for cause (as specified in his employment agreement) or upon his 65th birthday and would receive no payments. Termination by the Company not for cause or resignation by Mr. Gourlay requires twelve months' notice; accordingly, Mr. Gourlay would be entitled to his base salary and all other compensation and benefits during this notice period; provided, however, that the Company may terminate Mr. Gourlay's employment immediately and pay his base 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION 
salary in monthly installments through the earlier of the end of the notice period or until Mr. Gourlay were to find alternative employment. No additional payments would be made to Mr. Gourlay were his termination to occur in connection with a change in control. In the event of a termination due to permanent disability or death as a result of an accident, Mr. Gourlay would receive three times his base salary pursuant to a personal accident insurance policy, which equals £2,165,814 ($2,918,131). Upon death while employed, a lump sum death benefit of £3,609,690 ($4,863,552) would be payable (pursuant to a life insurance policy paid for by the Company), which represents five times Mr. Gourlay's base salary. 
The information above (and in the table below) does not include benefits to be paid to Mr. Gourlay pursuant to the Boots Pension Plan, Boots Supplementary Pension Plan, and Boots Additional Pension Arrangement, as these account balances are earned and payable, and the aggregate payment amounts will not vary based on the reason for termination of employment. The current actuarial value of accumulated benefits under these plans as of August 31, 2018 are included in "Pension Benefits" above. 
Mr. Fairweather has served in a reduced capacity since June 30, 2018 pursuant to a Contract Amendment entered into March 6, 2018. However, the Contract Amendment did not change the provisions of his employment agreement relating to termination of employment except as to the elimination of a mandatory retirement age and the reduction of the termination notice period from twelve to three months. Accordingly, Mr. Fairweather may be terminated for cause (as specified in his employment agreement) and would receive no payments. Termination by the Company not for cause or resignation by Mr. Fairweather requires three months' notice; accordingly, Mr. Fairweather would be entitled to his base salary and all other compensation and benefits for this notice period; provided, however, that the Company may terminate Mr. Fairweather's employment immediately and pay in monthly installments through the end of the notice period a total of £75,122 ($101,216), which represents base salary, cash payments in lieu of participation in a defined contribution plan (i.e., pension supplement) and a car allowance. No additional payments would be made to Mr. Fairweather should his termination occur in connection with a change in control. In the event of a termination due to permanent disability or death as a result of an accident, Mr. Fairweather would receive three times his base salary pursuant to a personal accident insurance policy, which equals £631,041 ($850,239). Upon death while employed, a lump sum death benefit of £1,051,735 ($1,417,066) would be payable (pursuant to a life insurance policy paid for by the Company), which represents five times Mr. Fairweather's base salary. 
In addition to the benefits described above, each of Ms. Barra and Messrs. Fairweather and Gourlay hold stock option and performance share awards issued in 2016, 2017, and 2018, as reflected in "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table above. Upon termination of employment of any of these NEOs as of August 31, 2018, these equity awards would be forfeited, except in the following circumstances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event of death while employed, or termination due to disability, then he or she receives the following benefits with  respect to these equity awards:

The amounts shown in the table assume that each such NEO's last day worked was August 31, 2018.

The value shown for Mr. Skinner for the 2018 grant for retirement from the Board is pro-rated pursuant to the terms of the applicable RSU award agreement.

Other. In addition to the compensation and benefits described above, (1) if any NEO retires after reaching the age of 55 and achieves at least 10 years of service with the Company or its subsidiaries, or (2) in the event of the death of an NEO while employed, or the termination of an NEO due to disability, such NEO would receive a pro-rated award under the MIP for the final partial year of participation, to the extent such NEO participates in the MIP. Because the MIP amounts are deemed earned as of the last day of the fiscal year, such amounts have been excluded from this section. See "2018 Summary Compensation Table" above for payments received under the MIP for 2018. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by the SEC rules, we are providing the following information comparing the annual total compensation of our CEO and Vice Chairman, Stefano Pessina, to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees other than our CEO. 
Identification of Median Employee. The Company has a presence in 25 countries. We identified our median employee using our active employee population on June 1, 2018, including 320,484 employees. The pay ratio disclosure rules provide an exemption for companies to exclude non-U.S. employees from the median employee calculation if non-U.S. employees in a particular jurisdiction account for five percent (5%) or less of the company's total number of employees. We applied this de minimis exemption when identifying the median employee by excluding 2,403 employees in Germany. After taking into account the de minimis exemption, 222,235 employees in the United States and 95,846 employees located outside of the United States were considered for identifying the median employee. The total of these excluded employees represented less than 1% of our workforce. 
To identify the median employee, we considered the total actual cash earnings (base salary, overtime, and bonus) for the period of June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018 for all active employees including full-time, part-time, seasonal and employees on leave. 
As disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, our CEO had total annual compensation of $13,542,260 and our median employee had compensation of $31,132, as calculated in accordance with the Summary Compensation Table disclosure rules but including employer provided healthcare benefits. As a result, we estimate that the ratio of our CEO's compensation to that of our median employee was 435 to 1.

What am I voting on? 
Stockholders are being asked to approve the amended and restated Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
What is the Board's voting recommendation? 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" Proposal 4. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
What is the required vote? 
Approval of Proposal 4 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. If you elect to abstain, the abstention will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote on Proposal 4. 
The Board is asking our stockholders to approve an amendment and restatement of the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). The stockholders of Walgreens last approved the ESPP at Walgreens' 2009 annual meeting. The ESPP is designed to assist employees of the Company in acquiring shares of our common stock as an investment over a period of years. 
We are not asking our stockholders to approve any additional shares for issuance under the ESPP. We believe this reflects our reasonable use of shares of our common stock previously authorized under the ESPP. 
In 2008, the Board of Directors of Walgreens approved an amendment to the ESPP to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP from 74,000,000 to 94,000,000. The shareholders of Walgreens approved this amendment at our 2009 annual meeting. Of these 94,000,000 shares authorized for issuance, 11,357,395 shares remain available for purchase under the ESPP, which may be subject to adjustment in the case of any change in the shares of the Company, including by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, stock split, split up, spin off, combination or exchange of shares, reorganization, liquidation, or other change in corporate capitalization. As of November 26, 2018, the closing sales price per share of our common stock on Nasdaq was $81.70. 
On July 10, 2018, pursuant to previously-delegated authority from the Board, the Compensation Committee, subject to approval by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, further amended the ESPP (i) to allow for future participation by employees of our designated non-US entities, (ii) to allow for the granting of options to purchase shares under a sub-plan that is not designed to be tax qualified under Section 423 of the Code and (iii) to provide other expanded flexibility under the ESPP to the Compensation Committee (e.g., non-US offerings, participating employers, eligibility rules, stock purchase alternatives and procedures, etc.). If such stockholder approval is obtained, the amendment and restatement of the ESPP would become effective as of April 1, 2019. 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
Summary of the Plan 
The principal features of the ESPP, as amended and restated, are summarized below. This summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of the ESPP set forth in Exhibit B to this Proxy Statement. 
Participation. Subject to the proper completion of an authorization form, any full or part time employee who is providing services to the Company, a designated subsidiary or a designated affiliate shall be eligible to participate as an eligible employee, unless any such employee is specifically excluded by the Compensation Committee from participation. Prior to the date of grant, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may determine that the definition of an eligible employee will or will not include an individual if he or she: (i) is under the age of 18, (ii) has not completed at least 90 days of service since his or her last hire date (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by the Compensation Committee), (iii) customarily works not more than twenty (20) hours per week (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by the Compensation Committee), (iv) customarily works not more than five (5) months per calendar year (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by the Compensation Committee), or (v) is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code, provided that any such exclusion is applied with respect to each offering in a uniform manner to all similarly-situated employees who otherwise would be eligible employees for that offering. Further, employees who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction may be excluded from participation in the ESPP or an offering. As of August 31, 2018, approximately 184,739 employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP. 
Plan Components. The ESPP includes two components. The first component, which we refer to as the 423 component, is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and generally covers our U.S. employees. The second component, which we refer to as the non-423 component, is not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, and generally covers certain of our non-U.S. employees. 
Purchases. The ESPP provides that participating employees may purchase shares of our common stock in an amount up to 25% of the employee's compensation and subject to a $25,000 annual purchase limit based on the fair market value of the shares on the applicable date of grant. The purchase price is established by the Compensation Committee for each option period, but may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of a share on the first day of the applicable option period or on the purchase date, whichever date results in a lower price. The "purchase date" is the last trading day of any option period. The Compensation Committee shall determine the length of each option period and such option periods shall not exceed 27 months in length. A participating employee may elect to pay for the purchase of stock by a payroll deduction, or if permitted by the Compensation Committee, by cash, check or other means. Payroll deductions or other contributions, as applicable, will commence on the first payday following the first day of the option period (the "date of grant") and will end on the last payday prior to the purchase date of the option period unless properly earlier terminated or changed by the participant. No employee may purchase more than 5,000 shares of our common stock in any option period (or such other maximum number designated by the Committee). No employee shall be granted an option under the ESPP if immediately after such grant, such employee would be treated as owning or holding five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any parent or subsidiary. The shares so purchased are then entered in the employee's account, and the employee can elect to have certificates for such shares delivered to him or her pursuant to procedures established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may require a participant to hold shares of our stock purchased under the ESPP in a designated brokerage account for a certain period of time. 
Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, any amounts credited to an employee's account that have not been used to purchase shares at the employee's termination of employment are distributed to the employee or, in the case of death, to the employee's estate. 
Rights Not Transferable. Rights granted under the ESPP are not transferable by a participating employee other than by will or under the laws of descent and distribution and are exercisable only by the employee during his or her lifetime. 
Administration. The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee (or its designee). No member of the Compensation Committee is eligible to participate in the ESPP. 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
Amend / Terminate. The Board (or the Compensation Committee, pursuant to delegated authority from the Board) has the power to amend or alter the ESPP at any time, provided that any such amendment or alteration may not adversely affect the rights of any participant or beneficiary without the consent of the affected participant or beneficiary. However, if applicable law requires stockholder approval of any amendment, then such amendment will be subject to the requisite stockholder approval. The Board may terminate the ESPP at any time. 
General Federal Income Tax Summary with Respect to the ESPP 
The 423 component of the ESPP is intended to be an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. The ESPP also authorizes the grant of rights to purchase shares that do not qualify under Section 423 pursuant to the non-423 component. 
423 Component Offerings 
Under the 423 component, no taxable income will be recognized by a participant, and no deductions will be allowable to the Company, upon either the grant or the exercise of the purchase rights. Taxable income will not be recognized until there is a sale or other disposition of the shares acquired under the ESPP or in the event the participant should die while still owning the purchased shares. 
If the participant sells or otherwise disposes of the purchased shares within two years after the start date of the option period in which the shares were acquired or within one year after the actual purchase date of those shares, whichever is later, then the participant will recognize ordinary income, in the year of sale or disposition, equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date exceeded the purchase price paid for those shares, and the Company will be entitled to an income tax deduction (subject to applicable limits under the Code, including, if applicable, those imposed by Code Section 162(m)), for the taxable year equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant. The amount of this ordinary income will be added to the participant's basis in the shares and any resulting gain or loss recognized upon the sale or disposition will be a capital gain or loss. If the shares have been held for more than one year since the date of purchase, the gain or loss will be long-term. 
If the participant sells or disposes of the purchased shares more than two years after the start date of the option period in which the shares were acquired and more than one year after the actual purchase date of those shares (a "qualifying disposition"), then the participant will recognize ordinary income in the year of sale or disposition equal to the lesser of (a) the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the sale or disposition date exceeded the purchase price paid for those shares or (b) the applicable purchase price discount on the purchased shares, measured against the fair market value of the shares on the first day of that option period. Any additional gain upon the disposition will be taxed as a long-term capital gain. Alternatively, if the fair market value of the shares on the date of the sale or disposition is less than the purchase price, there will be no ordinary income and any loss recognized will be a long-term capital loss. The Company will not be entitled to an income tax deduction with respect to a qualifying disposition. 
If the participant still owns the purchased shares at the time of death, the lesser of (i) the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the date of death exceeds the purchase price or (ii) the applicable purchase price discount on the purchased shares, measured against the fair market value of the shares on the first day of the option period in which those shares were acquired will constitute ordinary income in the year of death. The Company will not be entitled to an income tax deduction with respect to a qualifying disposition. 
Non-423 Component Offerings 
If a purchase right is granted under the non-423 component of the ESPP, then to the extent a participant is subject to U.S. federal income tax, the participant will recognize ordinary income, in the year of purchase, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date over the purchase price. The amount of such ordinary income will be added to the participant's basis in the shares, and any additional gain or resulting loss recognized on the disposition of the shares, after such basis adjustment, will be a capital gain or loss. A capital gain or loss will be long-term if the participant

holds the shares for more than one year after the purchase date. The Company may be entitled to a deduction in the year of purchase equal to the amount of ordinary income realized by the participant (subject to applicable limits under the Code, including, if applicable, those imposed by Code Section 162(m)). 
The foregoing is only a summary of the U.S. federal income taxation of participants and the Company as to the participation in the ESPP. This discussion is not intended to be exhaustive and does not provide tax guidance to participants in the ESPP, as the consequences may vary. The summary does not address the effects of other federal taxes (including employment taxes or excise taxes, or taxability under Section 409A of the Code) or taxes imposed under state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws. The summary is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding tax penalties. 
Plan Benefits 
It is not possible to determine how many eligible employees will participate in the ESPP in the future. Therefore, it is not possible to determine with certainty the dollar value or number of shares of common stock that will be distributed under the ESPP. Our directors and named executive officers do not participate in the ESPP. In 2018, our executive officers as a group did not purchase any shares of common stock under the ESPP. In 2018, employees as a group (other than executive officers) purchased 860,776 shares of our common stock under the ESPP, having a value of $59,014,803, based on the fair market value of our common stock as of August 31, 2018 of $68.56.

➋ We have two active equity incentive plans, both of which have been approved by our stockholders: the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (f/k/a the 1982 Employees Stock Purchase Plan) (the ESPP). As of August 31, 2018, we also had outstanding equity awards that may be settled for shares of our common stock under two other plans approved by our stockholders: the Walgreen Co. Executive Stock Option Plan (as assumed by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.) (the Former Option Plan) and the Walgreen Co. Long-Term Performance Incentive Plan (as assumed by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.) (the Former Incentive Plan). 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for incentive compensation to Non-Employee Directors and our officers and employees, and permits various stock-based awards. These include, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, performance units and SARs. Pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the number of authorized shares under the plan is reduced at two different rates depending on the type of award. Each share of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or SARs reduces the number of shares available for future delivery under the Omnibus Incentive Plan by one share, while each share of common stock issued pursuant to "full value awards" reduces the number of shares available for future delivery by three shares. "Full value awards" are awards, other than stock options, SARs and awards where the participant has directly or indirectly paid the intrinsic value of the award, that are settled by the issuance of shares of common stock, including RSUs and performance shares. Awards that do not entitle the holder to receive or purchase shares, awards that are settled in cash, and awards that are granted in substitution for awards under a plan of an acquired entity are not counted against the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of August 31, 2018, 32,576,183 shares were available for future issuance under this plan. 
The ESPP is a tax-qualified Code Section 423 stock purchase plan under which eligible employees are permitted to purchase shares of our common stock at a 10% discount. As of August 31, 2018, 11,419,359 shares were available for future issuance under this plan. 
Former Plans: The Omnibus Incentive Plan consolidated into a single plan several previously existing equity compensation plans: the Former Option Plan, the Former Incentive Plan, the Walgreen Co. Broad Based Employee Stock Option Plan and the Walgreen Co. Nonemployee Director Stock Plan (collectively, the "Former Plans"). Following shareholder approval on January 9, 2013, the effective date of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, no further grants may be made under the Former Plans and shares that were available for issuance under the Former Plans and not subject to outstanding awards became available for issuance (in addition to newly authorized shares) under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, shares that are subject to outstanding awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Former Plans and the former Share Walgreens Walgreen Co. Stock Purchase/Option Plan (the "Former Share Walgreens Plan") that subsequently are cancelled, forfeited, lapsed, or are otherwise terminated or settled without a distribution of shares become available for awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Former Option Plan was an incentive compensation plan that permitted the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to eligible employees. The Former Incentive Plan was an incentive compensation plan that permitted the grant of restricted stock, RSUs, performance units and performance shares. For additional information about our equity compensation plans, see Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2018 Annual Report. 
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION 
➌ We have equity awards that may be settled for shares of our common stock outstanding under the Former Share Walgreens Plan and under certain equity compensation plans and awards we assumed in connection with our acquisition of drugstore.com, inc. in June 2011 that were not approved by our stockholders. The Former Share Walgreens Plan expired on September 30, 2012. As a result, no further awards may be granted under that plan. 
The Former Share Walgreens Plan was a stock purchase and stock option incentive compensation plan that allowed eligible non-executive employees to buy stock (up to a specified percentage of base annual salary) during specific periods. For each share of common stock an employee purchased through the plan, the employee received from one to three options to purchase additional shares at a fixed price. The determination of the number of options was a function of the degree to which we attained pre-established performance goals. For options granted on or after October 1, 2005, the option price is the closing price of a share of common stock on the grant date. There is a two-year holding period on purchased shares, and, for grants made on or after October 31, 2008, options may be exercised after a three-year period. Unexercised options expire 10 years after the date of the grant, subject to earlier termination if the optionee's employment ends. The outstanding options under this plan as of August 31, 2018 are reflected in the above table. 
The above table does not include equity awards that we have assumed in connection with the acquisition of other companies. As of August 31, 2018, an additional 2,627 shares of our common stock were subject to outstanding stock options assumed in connection with acquisitions of other companies, including options to acquire an aggregate of 949 shares with a weighted-average exercise price of $9.83 per share, and SARs with respect to an aggregate of 1,678 shares with a weighted-average exercise price of $26.35 per share. No additional awards may be granted under these plans. 
➍ Comprised of options to acquire 18,382,599 shares, 517,945 shares subject to outstanding RSU awards and 1,949,794 shares subject to outstanding performance share awards. The number of performance shares indicated reflects the target amount awarded for awards outstanding as of August 31, 2018; the actual number of shares issued will range between 0% and 150% of the target amount for awards granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018 based upon our performance relative to the applicable goals as determined by the Compensation Committee following the end of the applicable performance period.

What am I voting on? 
The following four proposals were submitted by stockholders. 
What is the Board's voting recommendation? 
The Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" each of the following stockholder proposals. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
What is the required vote? 
Approval of each of the following stockholder proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. If you elect to abstain from voting on any of the following stockholder proposals, the abstention will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote on such proposal. 
The following four proposals were submitted by stockholders. If the stockholder proponent, or a representative who is qualified under state law, is present and submits such proposal for a vote, then the proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
In accordance with federal securities regulations, we have included each stockholder proposal plus any supporting statement as submitted by the proponent. We accept no responsibility for the accuracy of any stockholder proposal or any supporting statement. 
Proposal 5—Stockholder Proposal Requesting an Independent Board Chairman 
We have been advised that Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, who has indicated he is a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of our common stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposal 5—Independent Board Chairman 
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. 
If the Board determines that a Chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. 
Caterpillar is an example of a company changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman at its annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Now is an ideal time to take the first step to transition to an independent board chairman. Our stock price dropped $10 in a year. Plus our Lead Director, William Foote, had both roles at USG Corporation when it filed for bankruptcy. And Mr. Foote had more than 21-year long tenure at Walgreens. Long-tenure can impair the independence of a director—no matter how well qualified. Independence is a priceless attribute in a director. 
Plus Mr. Foote had still more influence on our company by chairing the Nomination Committee and having a seat on the Executive Pay Committee. 
Adoption of this proposal is a low hanging fruit item that will cost our company virtually nothing — yet it can improve director independence and company performance. 
Please vote yes: 
Independent Board Chairman—Proposal 5 
The Board's Statement in Opposition to Proposal 5 
The Board has carefully considered the proposal and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: 
The Company's Board leadership structure should be tailored to the Company's evolving needs and not limited to the proposal's "one-size-fits-all" approach. 
The Company's directors have a fiduciary duty to regularly consider the most appropriate Board leadership structure in light of the Company's specific and evolving circumstances. Accordingly, as discussed above under "Governance—Our Commitment to Strong Corporate Governance—Board Leadership Structure," the Company's by-laws provide the Board with the flexibility to select the most appropriate Board leadership structure. This flexibility benefits the Company and its stockholders because the Board is best positioned to evaluate the optimal leadership structure for the Company based upon the Company's leadership team, strategy, challenges and opportunities over time. The Board believes that it should continue to determine on a case-by-case basis the most effective leadership structure for the Company, rather than take the stockholder proposal's rigid, "one-size-fits-all" approach to Board leadership. 
The Board's current leadership structure provides effective, independent Board oversight. 
The Board evaluates the Board's leadership structure at least once a year in connection with the election of the Board Chairman. As described in more detail in "Governance—Our Commitment to Strong Corporate Governance—Board Leadership Structure," the Board believes that its current leadership structure allows it to provide effective, independent oversight of the Company. Specifically, since the Chairman of the Board currently is not an independent director, the Corporate Governance Guidelines require the independent directors to select a Lead Independent Director and vest the Lead Independent Director with significant responsibilities. Moreover, the independent directors meet regularly in executive sessions that are presided over by the Lead Independent Director with no members of management present. During these executive sessions, the independent directors discuss matters of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate, including evaluation of the Board Chairman and CEO, board meeting matters and board effectiveness. 
The Company's corporate governance policies and practices promote effective, independent Board oversight. 
In addition, the Board has adopted corporate governance policies and practices that promote a strong and effective Board that provides independent oversight. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors are elected annually and by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections.  
[END TABLE]

• Stockholders have meaningful proxy access and special meeting rights and cumulative voting.

• The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee are comprised entirely of  independent directors. This vests the independent directors with oversight of critical matters, such as the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the annual self-evaluation of the Board and its committees, and the compensation of  executive officers.  
[END TABLE]

• The Company has demonstrated a strong commitment to Board refreshment and to having highly qualified, independent voices on  the Board. Of the Board's nine independent directors, five have joined the Board since January 1, 2012.

• The Nominating and Governance Committee annually evaluates each director and recommends to the Board whether each should be  nominated for election to a one-year term.

The Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST Proposal 5. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
Proposal 6—Stockholder Proposal Regarding the Use of GAAP Financial Metrics for Purposes of Determining Senior Executive Compensation 
We have been advised that The City of Philadelphia Public Employees Retirement System, Sixteenth Floor, Two Penn Center Plaza, Philadelphia, PA, 19102, which has indicated it is a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of our common stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
RESOLVED, shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (the "Company") urge the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to adopt a policy that when using performance metrics to calculate senior executive compensation, the Company shall not adjust performance metrics that are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The policy should be implemented in a way that does not violate any existing contractual obligation of the Company or the terms of any compensation or benefit plan. 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
As shareholders, we are concerned that the use of adjusted GAAP financial metrics for senior executive compensation benchmarks can undermine the connection between pay and performance. In our view, if the Company chooses to use GAAP metrics to calculate performance then the calculation of the metric should follow GAAP rather than exclude certain costs. In our view, the use of adjusted GAAP metrics complicates investors' ability to compare senior executive compensation performance metrics across companies. 
The Company has rewarded senior executives through its incentive pay plans, the pay-outs for which are calculated with adjustments that increased the awards. The Company used adjusted Earnings Per Share ("EPS") for its long-term incentive plan and adjusted Operating Income ("OCI") for its annual incentive plan (2018 proxy statement, page 6). The Company made adjustments to EPS that increased the result by nearly 35 percent and to the OCI that increased the result by nearly 36 percent. The specific adjustments are not disclosed in the proxy statement. A review of the 2017 annual report however reveals cost transformation, acquisition-related costs, other income among the list of items whose impact are adjusted out (2017 annual report, pages 45-47). 
It is our belief that the use of adjusted GAAP financial metrics can tilt the scales to unduly help executives achieve their performance benchmarks and insulate them from missteps. These considerations are especially critical at the Company given the potential reputational, legal and regulatory risks it faces over its role in the nation's opioid epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control, prescription opioids claim 115 lives a day in this country. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
In 2013, Walgreens agreed to pay a record $80 million civil penalty to settle claims that it failed to properly control the sale of opioids (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/business/walgreen-to-pay-80-million-settlement-over-painkiller-sales.html). An investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2016 revealed that a Walgreens pharmacy had no explanation for 8,000 missing hydrocodone tablets (https://www.thestreet.com/politics/dea-doj-making-moves-in-crisis-to-contain-opioid-supply-chain-14638575). The Company continues to face legal risks and is a defendant in the multidistrict opioid litigation in Ohio brought by hundreds of municipalities (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/us/politics/justice-department-opioid-lawsuit.html). 
At this critical time when the Company faces legal and reputational scrutiny, executive pay incentives should be transparent and incentivize executive accountability. A consistent calculation for the drivers of executive incentive pay would improve clarity. An explanation for why adjustments need to be applied to such a calculation would be a step in that direction. 
For these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote FOR this resolution 
The Board's Statement in Opposition to Proposal 6 
The Board has carefully considered the proposal and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: 
The Board is committed to creating an executive compensation program that aligns with and promotes the Company's objectives and long-term stockholder value. 
The Company's executive compensation programs are designed to incentivize our senior executives to achieve the Company's objectives, including creating long-term stockholder value. As the administrator of our executive compensation programs, the Compensation Committee (which is composed entirely of independent directors) regularly reviews the Company's incentive compensation program and evaluates whether the current structure, including the performance measures used, supports these goals. For example, as discussed above under "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Program Updates for 2019," the Compensation Committee recently reviewed the Company's incentive compensation for senior executives and determined that the structure of long-term incentive compensation should be revised to provide for 70% of long-term incentive compensation paid in the form of performance shares and 30% paid in the form of stock options for fiscal 2019. The Compensation Committee believes at this time that this mix of compensation will best align the interests of our senior executive officers with those of the Company's stockholders. This proposal would limit the Compensation Committee's flexibility to continue to review and evaluate a key aspect of the Company's incentive compensation programs by restricting the performance measures used, which we do not believe is in the best interests of the Company or stockholders. 
Adjusted measures best align executives' incentive compensation with the Company's operational performance. 
As discussed above under "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—III. Target Setting for Incentive Compensation," the Compensation Committee selected adjusted operating Income and adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") for use in its executive compensation programs for the 2018-2020 performance period in order to promote effective Company operational performance. The Compensation Committee believes that these measures best reflect the Company's operational performance. Therefore, at this time these are the most appropriate metrics to utilize in the Company's incentive compensation programs because they closely align senior executive performance with the creation of long-term stockholder value. 
In contrast, GAAP measures include some items that may not fairly reflect the Company's actual performance. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Using only GAAP performance metrics could result in performance targets that incorporate certain items outside of  management control and reduce comparability. For example, GAAP includes the impact of foreign currency gains and losses, which makes it difficult to compare performance across both periods and peers for short-term plans. The Board does not  believe it is desirable to either reward or penalize executives based on the impact of foreign currency swings in our short-term plan.  
[END TABLE]
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Using only GAAP performance metrics could result in performance targets that are misaligned with the long-term interests  of the Company and stockholders. For example, GAAP-based metrics include any gains resulting from disposal of business units. Those business units could be strategic or beneficial to the long-term health of the Company. In this situation, GAAP  metrics would result in higher EPS, but would not be in the long-term interests of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee exercises independent judgment so that adjusted measures do not inappropriately increase executive compensation. 
The Compensation Committee carefully reviews and evaluates performance measures used in our incentive compensation programs so that senior executive compensation fairly corresponds to the Company's operating performance. In this regard, the Compensation Committee historically has made both positive and negative adjustments to the adjusted performance measures. The Board believes that this proposal would unduly constrain the Compensation Committee's flexibility to promote the Company's objectives and the creation of long-term stockholder value by dictating the basis of the performance measures used (GAAP or adjusted measures). 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST Proposal 6. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
Proposal 7 —Stockholder Proposal Requesting Report on Governance Measures Related to Opioids 
We have been advised that Mercy Investment Services, Inc., 12039 North Geyer Road, St. Louis, MO 63131, which has indicated it is a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of our common stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
RESOLVED, that shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. ("Walgreens") urge the Board of Directors (the "Board") to report to shareholders by June 30, 2019 describing the corporate governance changes Walgreens has implemented since 2012 to more effectively monitor and manage financial and reputational risks related to the opioid crisis, including whether and how the Board oversees Walgreens' opioid-related programs and AmerisourceBergen's opioid-related risks, whether the crisis has been designated (or is encompassed within) a material corporate social responsibility (CSR) issue and whether and how Walgreens has changed senior executive incentive compensation arrangements. 
The report should be prepared at reasonable cost and should omit confidential and proprietary information. 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
Opioid abuse is a public health crisis: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that opioid abuse caused more than 42,000 U.S. deaths in 2016. The economic and social effects of the crisis are profound. A recent report pegged the cumulative economic toll of the opioid epidemic at over $1 trillion. (https://altarum.org/ about/news-and-events/economic-toll-of-opioid-crisis-in-u-s-exceeded-1-trillion-since-2001) Opioid use and dependency is a key factor in the decline in prime-age male labor force participation. (https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017 /09/1_krueger.pdf) 
Walgreens has repeatedly come under fire for irresponsible dispensing and distribution of opioids. In 2013, Walgreens settled claims that it committed an "unprecedented number" of federal Controlled Substances Act violations by failing to report suspicious orders, maintaining inadequate controls against diversion and dispensing opioids despite red flags. Walgreens paid a record $80 million civil penalty. (https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/walgreens-agrees-pay-record-settlement-80-million-civil-penalties-under-controlled)  
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Walgreens is a defendant in the Ohio multidistrict opioid litigation. (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/us/politics/justice-department-opioid-lawsuit.html) The states of Delaware and Kentucky, the City of Miami and the Cherokee Nation have also sued Walgreens for improperly dispensing opioids. (The Kentucky lawsuit contends that Walgreens also acted as a wholesale distributor in that state.) In March 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted an administrative inspection of a Walgreens' pharmacy in California that had purchased an unusually large number of opioid pills and had an "unexplained loss" of 8,000 hydrocodone tablets. (https://www.revealnews.org/article/this-walgreens-gets-5-times-us-average-of-oxycodone-the-dea-is-asking-why/; https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4452667-Return-Accounting-for-Items-Seized.html) 
Walgreens owns 26% of distributor AmerisourceBergen, which faces significant financial and reputational consequences for its role in the opioid epidemic, and the two companies have talked about combining. (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/walgreens-and-amerisourcebergen-deal-talks-of-cooled-.html;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/drug-executives-to-testify-before-congress-about-their-role-in-us-opioid-crisis/2018/04/12/89e7ccf2-3db6-  11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?utm_term=.5670fdc325f6) 
In our view, corporate governance can play an important role in effectively addressing opioid-related risks and we think shareholders would benefit from a fuller understanding of how Walgreens' governance has changed since 2012 to serve that function. For example, Walgreens' most recent proxy statement asserts that individual performance is considered in determining annual incentive awards, but does not indicate whether any opioid-related objectives, such as promoting ethical conduct, are part of that assessment. Walgreens' 2017 CSR report touts Walgreens' opioid-related initiatives such as take-back programs but does not indicate whether the Board's Nominating and Governance Committee oversees them or Walgreens' anti-diversion efforts. Nor is it clear from the report how the opioid crisis fits into Walgreens' designation of material CSR issues. (https://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/content/1110/files/Walgreens-Boots-Alliance_Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Report-2017.pdf) 
We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.

The Board has carefully considered the proposal and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: 
The Company already discloses the governance measures and other controls it has implemented to effectively monitor and manage significant risks associated with the Company's business. 
As discussed in this Proxy Statement under "Governance—Board Oversight of Strategy and Risk Management," the Company has implemented a strong ERM program, led by the Global Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer. The ERM program reviews on a regular basis the top current and emerging enterprise risks facing the Company, including opioid-related risks. In addition, pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee reviews our policies and processes with respect to enterprise risk assessment and risk management and discusses with management the key risks identified in the ERM process and our risk mitigation strategies on an ongoing basis. In addition, the other standing committees of the Board review and oversee management of risks related to their respective areas of responsibility. The committees regularly report to the full Board regarding identified risks and risk management. 
The Board continually reviews and improves the Company's risk management processes, including through its annual review of Company strategic plans and its oversight of the ERM program. The role of the Board and its committees in enterprise risk management is described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Company's website at https://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com. The Board regularly reviews and updates the Corporate Governance Guidelines and committee charters. The Corporate Governance Guidelines and committee charters were recently reviewed by the Nominating & Governance Committee in January 2018. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
The Company already publicly discloses specific actions that the Company takes to manage opioid-related risks. 
The Company annually publishes a Corporate Social Responsibility Report that includes information about our identification of and response to opioid-related risks. Our most recent Corporate Social Responsibility Report included a section providing specific information regarding the Company's actions to help prevent opioid abuse and overdose-related deaths, including, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's expansion of its program to prevent opioid abuse and fight the rise in overdose-related deaths, including  working with government representatives to change legislation and implement solutions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Key Company initiatives to manage opioid-related risks, including increasing the availability of the opioid antidote  naloxone at pharmacies, patient education programs and safe drug disposal kiosks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's medication disposal program, launched in 2016, which collects and disposes of unused medications to  combat the opioid abuse crisis; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's launch of the #ItEndsWithUs campaign to educate teens across the United States on the opioid epidemic.   
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Social Responsibility Report is available at http://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/corporate-social-responsibility-report/. 
The Company also publicly provides updates regarding specific initiatives to effectively monitor and manage opioid-related risks through periodic press releases and announcements. For example, the Company issued a press release in June 2018 that announced our achievement of the milestone of installing 1,000 safe medication disposal kiosks at our drugstores across the U.S. The release also noted that the Company's safe medication disposal program had collected and safely disposed of more than 270 tons of medications since the launch of the program in 2016. We believe that such updates help effectively inform investors and others regarding the Company's most current efforts to monitor and manage opioid-related risks. 
The Compensation Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, regularly reviews risks associated with the design and implementation of our compensation programs and carefully considers and approves the Company's executive compensation programs annually. 
As discussed in "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—IX. Other Matters—A. Compensation Risk Oversight," the Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves our executive compensation programs, including any associated risks. As part of its review and approval process, the Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation consultant to conduct a risk review of our compensation programs and assess whether any of our incentive compensation plans would encourage our executives or employees to undertake unnecessary or inappropriate risks that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company. In 2018, the Compensation Committee carefully reviewed and considered this external risk assessment and the risk mitigating controls in place for each compensation plan, and determined that it was not reasonably likely that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices would have a material adverse effect on us. 
The Company also conducts an annual advisory stockholder vote on our named executive officer compensation. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company's stockholders overwhelmingly approved our named executive officer compensation. 
The Company actively engages with stockholders and responds to stockholder feedback to strengthen our governance and compensation programs and enhance disclosure of our existing practices. 
The Company maintains an open dialogue with stockholders, including regarding key areas of our governance and compensation programs, such as risk management. In response to stockholder feedback, we have taken a number of actions to enhance our existing practices. Please refer to the information contained under the heading "Proxy Statement Summary—Stockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness" in this Proxy Statement for more information. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
These actions demonstrate that the Company is committed to combatting opioid abuse and overdose-related deaths. 
As discussed above, the Company and the Board are undertaking significant efforts to prevent opioid abuse and overdose-related deaths including, among other things, our robust ERM program and the installation of safe drug disposal kiosks in our pharmacies nationwide. Furthermore, the Company has regularly updated and disclosed its policies and practices related to these efforts and plans to continue to do so going forward. In light of this, the Board believes that a report such as the one requested by the proposal is not necessary. Such a report would provide only incremental additional information to stockholders and would not advance the Company's strong ERM program or other risk management controls. Therefore, the Board believes that the proposal is not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST Proposal 7. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions. 
Proposal 8—Stockholder Proposal Regarding the Ownership Threshold for Calling Special Meetings of Stockholders 
We have been advised that John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, who has indicated he is a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of our common stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposal 8—Special Shareholder Meeting Insurance Policy 
Shareowners ask our board of directors to take the steps necessary (unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and appropriate governing documents to give the owners of a total of 10% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting (or the closest percentage to 10% according to state law). This proposal does not impact our board's current power to call a special meeting. 
There is no indication that the management of Walgreens will ask shareholders to ratify our existing special meeting provisions in an attempt to prevent shareholders from voting on this proposal. However the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14H states, "We will not, however, view a shareholder proposal as directly conflicting with a management proposal if a reasonable shareholder, although possibly preferring one proposal over the other, could logically vote for both." 
Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14H did not state that a company has the last word on whether there is a conflict. The 2018 Walgreens annual meeting proxy said Walgreens had "a robust stockholder engagement program." No company ever stated that its shareholders are clamoring to ratify existing governance provisions (like the special meeting provisions) based on the results of "a robust stockholder engagement program." 
Special shareholder meetings allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings. This proposal topic won more than 70%-support at Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison. This proposal topic, sponsored by William Steiner, also won 78% support at a Sprint annual meeting with 1.7 Billion yes-votes. 
Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN) shareholders gave 94%-support in February 2018 to a rule 14a-8 proposal calling for 10% of shareholders to call a special meeting. 
It is important that our company goes the extra mile and adopts an ownership threshold of 10% as an insurance policy. Some companies have adopted an ownership threshold of 20% which can be unrealistic. An ownership threshold of 20% can mean that more than 50% of shareholders need to be contacted during a short window of time to simply call a special meeting. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
And this effort must be funded from the pockets of shareholders which tends to establish that there is a serious financial need to call a special shareholder meeting. Plus many shareholders, who are convinced that a special meeting should be called, can make a small paperwork error that will disqualify them from counting toward the ownership threshold that is needed for a special meeting. This is all the more likely to happen given the dense legalistic text in our bylaws regarding the special meeting procedures. 
Please vote yes: 
Special Shareholder Meeting Insurance Policy—Proposal 8 
The Board's Statement in Opposition to Proposal 8 
The Board has carefully considered the proposal and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company currently provides stockholders with the rights to call a special meeting and act by written consent, the terms  of which reflect current market practice.  
[END TABLE]
The current ownership threshold of 20% to call a special meeting permits stockholders owning a reasonable minority of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock to call special meetings while helping to avoid using corporate resources on business items that may not reflect the interests of the Company and its broader stockholder base and may not garner significant support. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company has corporate governance practices in place, including proxy access and cumulative voting, which protect  stockholder rights and provide meaningful avenues for smaller stockholders to effectively voice their opinions without the expense and risk associated with a lower special meeting threshold.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company engages in robust stockholder engagement throughout the year in order to allow stockholders to easily provide  feedback to management and the Board on an ongoing basis.  
[END TABLE]
The Company permits stockholders holding in the aggregate 20% or more of its outstanding shares of common stock to call special meetings, with procedural safeguards designed to protect the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. The Board believes that the Company's current threshold strikes the appropriate balance between providing stockholders with a meaningful right to call a special meeting when an urgent, extraordinary event arises, on the one hand, while preventing a small minority of stockholders—who may have narrow, short-term interests—from causing, to the detriment of the Company's other stockholders, the Company to incur the unnecessary expense or disruption of a special meeting to pursue matters that are not widely viewed as requiring immediate attention, on the other hand. Moreover, the Board notes that, as of October 2018, the current 20% ownership threshold is the same as, or more favorable to stockholders than, the special meeting rights at approximately 85.1% of the 469 S&P 500 companies surveyed by SharkRepellent.com. 
The Company's corporate governance policies and practices provide stockholders with numerous avenues to voice their opinions and encourage Board accountability and responsiveness to stockholder feedback. In addition to stockholders' existing rights to call a special meeting, to act by written consent, to nominate a director via proxy access and to exercise cumulative voting rights, the Company has no supermajority voting provisions in its charter or by-laws and a majority vote standard is applicable in uncontested director elections. Furthermore, the Company has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to Board refreshment and to having highly qualified, independent voices on the Board. Of the Board's nine independent directors, five have joined the Board since January 1, 2012. 
The Company's strong corporate governance practices include a robust stockholder engagement program. Company leaders meet regularly with stockholders to discuss strategy, operational performance, and business practices. The Company also meets with stockholders throughout the year to share perspectives on corporate governance, executive compensation, and related matters. For additional information about the Company's stockholder engagement program and actions it has taken in response to these discussions, please see "Governance—Additional Topics of Interest—Stockholder Engagement" above. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
The Board believes that the Company's strong corporate governance practices, including the Company's commitment to ongoing dialogue with its stockholders, provide stockholders with the significant ability to raise important matters with the Board and management in a manner tailored to the Company's particular ownership composition without the potential expense and risk associated with a lower special meeting threshold. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST Proposal 8. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? What effect will abstentions and broker non-votes have?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Proposal 1 (Election of Directors). The election of directors at the Annual Meeting is an uncontested election.  This means, with respect to the election of directors, the number of votes "FOR" a director's election must be a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of our common stock voting in person or by proxy at the Annual  Meeting with respect to that director's election. Abstentions with respect to a director will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" him or her.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Other Proposals. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual  Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve each of the other proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. For each of these proposals, abstentions have the same effect as a vote against approval of that proposal.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Broker Non-Votes. If you are a beneficial holder and do not provide  specific voting instructions to your broker, then the organization that holds your shares will not be authorized to vote your shares, which would result in "broker non-votes," on proposals other than  the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal 2). Accordingly, we encourage you to vote promptly, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes will not have an effect on any of the proposals.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What happens if a nominee who is duly nominated does not receive a majority vote?

[END TABLE]
We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Our management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. 
As more fully described in "Executive Compensation—III. Target Setting for Incentive Compensation—A. 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Target," in 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the use of adjusted operating income as the sole, absolute metric for measuring Company performance under the Company's short-term incentive plan, and as more fully described in "Executive Compensation—IV. Annual Compensation—B. 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Payments" above, the Compensation Committee used the same adjustments for purposes of reconciling adjusted operating income (which is a non-GAAP financial measure) to our operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as those we disclosed in our full year 2018 earnings release and related presentation on October 11, 2018. For additional details regarding this reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 11, 2018. Additionally, the Compensation Committee adjusted for the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on adjusted operating income by translating current period adjusted operating income results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars using the same exchange rates used for the Board-approved budget for 2018, from which the adjusted operating income target for 2018 was derived.

[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Purpose.  
[END TABLE]
The Plan is designed to assist Employees of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries and Designated Affiliates in acquiring the Company's Stock as an investment over a period of years on discounted basis through Contributions. This Plan includes two components: a Section 423 Component of the Code (the "423 Component") and a non-Section 423 Component of the Code (the "Non-423 Component"). It is the Company's intention to have the 423 Component qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code. The provisions of the 423 Component, accordingly, shall be administered, interpreted and construed so as to extend and limit participation in a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of Options under the Non-423 Component that does not qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code; such Options shall be granted pursuant to the rules, procedures or sub-plans adopted by the Committee designed to achieve tax, securities law or other objectives for Eligible Employees and the Company and its Designated Affiliates. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Non-423 Component will be operated and administered in the same manner as the 423 Component.

[END TABLE]

Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or its delegate, (i) an election to increase or decrease Contributions will become effective beginning with the succeeding Option Period and (ii) an election to discontinue Contributions or withdraw from the Plan and receive a refund of all Contributions will become effective as soon as administratively practicable after receipt. If a Participant elects to discontinue Contributions or withdraw from the Plan, Contributions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Option Period, unless the Participant re-enrolls in the Plan as prescribed by the Administrator from time to time. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  Purchase Price.  
[END TABLE]
The Purchase Price of shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option for any Option Period shall be established by the Committee (and may differ among Offerings, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), but in no event shall be less than the lesser of (i) 85% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Date of Grant for the applicable Option Period or (ii) 85% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the applicable Purchase Date for such Option Period. 
EXHIBIT B

11.  Manner of Purchasing Stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  With respect to those Eligible Employees who have enrolled in the Plan, the Administrator shall establish an  account in the name of each Participant in the Plan. A Participant's Contributions shall be credited to his or her account, shall be accumulated in such account without interest (except as may be required by Applicable Laws, as determined by  the Committee) and shall be applied as of each Purchase Date to purchase at the Purchase Price for such date the maximum number of whole and fractional shares of Stock that may be purchased with such funds.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b)  If a Participant's account contains sufficient funds to purchase a share of Stock as of any Purchase Date, he  or she shall be deemed to have exercised an Option to purchase shares of Stock at the Purchase Price for such date. As of the Purchase Date, a Participant's entitlement to such share or shares of Stock shall be appropriately noted on the  records of the Administrator. To the extent that an Option is not exercised between the Date of Grant and the end of an Option Period, the Option shall terminate.   
(c)  In no event shall the number of shares of Stock purchased by any Participant for any Option Period exceed 5,000, or  such other maximum number of shares as may be designated by the Committee from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d)  In the event that the number of shares of Stock to be purchased by all Participants in any Option Period exceeds  the number of shares of Stock then available for issuance under the Plan, (i) the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the remaining shares of Stock in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as the Committee shall, in its sole  discretion, determine to be equitable and (ii) all funds not used to purchase shares of Stock on the Purchase Date shall be returned, without interest to the Participants (except as may be required by Applicable Laws, as determined by the  Committee).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  Use of Funds.  
[END TABLE]
All Contributions received or held by the Company, Designated Affiliates and/or Designated Subsidiaries under the Plan may be used by the Company, Designated Affiliates and/or Designated Subsidiaries for any corporate purpose, and the Company, Designated Affiliates and/or Designated Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to segregate such funds, except as may be required by Applicable Laws, as determined by the Committee. Until the shares of Stock are issued, Participants will only have the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to the Plan, although Participants in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions may have additional rights where required under Applicable Laws, as determined by the Committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Withholding.  
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, at the time the Participant's Option under the Plan is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the shares of Stock issued under the Plan are disposed of by a Participant (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the Participant must make adequate provision for the payment and/or withholding of U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or any other tax liability payable to any authority, national insurance, social security, payment-on-account or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon the exercise of the Option or the disposition of the Shares (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any liability of the Participant to pay an Employer tax or social insurance contribution obligation, which liability has been shifted to the Participant as a matter of law or contract. At any time, the Company or Employer may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant's compensation, the amount necessary for the Company or Employer to meet applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or Employer any tax deductions or benefits attributable to a sale or early disposition of shares of Stock by the Participant. In addition, the Company or Employer may (i) withhold from the proceeds of the sale of shares of Stock, (ii) withhold a sufficient whole number of shares of Stock otherwise issuable upon purchase having an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy applicable withholding obligations, or (iii) withhold by any other means set forth in the applicable Authorization Agreement. 
EXHIBIT B

14.  Issuance of Stock Certificates and Shareholders Rights.  
[END TABLE]
By enrolling in the Plan, each Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the establishment of a brokerage account on his or her behalf at a securities brokerage firm selected by the Company. As soon as reasonably practicable after each Purchase Date on which a purchase of shares of Stock occurs, the Administrator shall establish procedures for the shares of Stock purchased by each Participant to be issued to such Participant by the Company in book entry form, in a brokerage account, in stock certificate form or such other acceptable method of issuance. None of the rights or privileges of a shareholder of the Company shall exist with respect to Stock purchased under the Plan unless and until the Participant shall become the beneficial owner of such Stock on the records of the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  Registration of Stock.  
[END TABLE]
Stock issued hereunder, will be registered only in the name of the Participant, or, if authorized by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) and the Participant's Authorization Form so specifies, in the name of the Participant and any other person as joint tenants with right of survivorship. No other names may be included in the Stock registration. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  Notification of Disposition of Shares of Stock; Holding Shares of Stock with Broker.   
[END TABLE]
Each Participant participating in the Section 423 Component of the Plan shall give the Administrator prompt notice of any disposition of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Option granted under the Plan in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the Administrator. The Administrator may require that until such time as a Participant disposes of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Option granted under the Plan, the Participant shall hold all such shares of Stock at a securities brokerage firm selected by the Company until the lapse of any time period(s) established by the Administrator. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.  Rights on Retirement, Death, or Termination of Employment.  
[END TABLE]
Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, upon a Participant's termination of employment, the Contributions credited to such Participant's account not yet used to purchase shares of Stock under the Plan will be distributed to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to such person entitled thereto in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. 
Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, for purposes of the 423 Component of the Plan, the employment relationship shall be treated as continuing intact while a Participant is on military leave or sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence approved by the Company or the Designated Subsidiary so long as the leave does not exceed three (3) months or, if longer than three (3) months, the individual's right to reemployment is provided by statute or has been agreed to by contract or in a written policy of the Company which provides for a right of reemployment following the leave of absence. Further, the employment relationship shall be treated as continuing intact where a Participant transfers employment between the Company, Designated Subsidiaries and/or Designated Affiliates; provided, however, that an individual who is not employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary on the Date of Grant and through a date that is no more than three (3) months prior to the Purchase Date will participate only in the Non-423 Component unless the individual continues to have a right to reemployment with the Company or a Designated Subsidiary provided by statute or contract or in a written policy of the Company which provides for a right of reemployment following the leave of absence. The Committee or its delegate shall establish rules to govern other transfers into the 423 Component, and between any separate Offerings established thereunder, consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 423 of the Code. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
18.  Rights Not Transferable.  
[END TABLE]
Rights and Options granted under this Plan are not transferable by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable only by the Participant during his or her lifetime. 
EXHIBIT B 
[BEGIN TABLE]
19.  Changes in Capitalization and Certain Transactions.  
[END TABLE]
In the event of any change (increase or decrease) in the outstanding shares of Stock by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, stock split, split up, spin off, combination or exchange of shares, reorganization, liquidation, or other change in corporate capitalization, the aggregate number and class of shares of Stock available under this Plan, the number and class of shares of Stock subject to each outstanding Option, the Purchase Price for each Option and the other limits set forth in this Plan in the form of shares of Stock or Purchase Price shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted by the Committee to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights and preserve the value of outstanding awards; provided that fractional shares of Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. In addition, in the event of any transaction or event described in this Section 19, or any unusual or nonrecurring transaction or events affecting the Company or any changes in applicable laws or regulations or accounting principles, the Committee, in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, it is hereby authorized to: (i) provide for either (X) termination of any outstanding Option in exchange for an amount in cash, if any, equal to the amount that would have been obtained upon exercise of such option had such option been currently exercisable or (Y) the replacement of such outstanding option with other rights or property selected by the Committee in its sole discretion; (ii) provide that the outstanding options under the Plan shall be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar rights covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and purchase prices; (iii) make adjustments in the number and type of shares (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding options under the Plan and/or in the terms and conditions of outstanding options which may be granted in the future; (iv) shorten the Option Period then in progress and set a new Purchase Date, which shall be a date immediately prior to the date of any transaction or event described in this Section 19; and/or (v) provide that all outstanding Options shall terminate without being exercised. The Committee's determination shall be final and conclusive. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
20.  No Purchase of Stock by Company.  
[END TABLE]
The Company will be under no obligation to repurchase from any Participant any shares of Stock he or she has acquired under the Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
21.  Amendment of the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Subject to applicable law or government regulation and to the rules of any Exchange or quotation system on which the shares of Stock may be traded or listed, the Board (or the Committee, pursuant to the delegation of authority by the Board) may at any time amend or alter the Plan in any respect; provided, however, that no amendment may make any change in any Option previously granted which adversely affects the rights of any Participant or any beneficiary (as applicable) without the consent of the affected Participant or beneficiary. To the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law, regulation or Exchange rule), the Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any amendments in such a manner and to such a degree as required. Without shareholder approval and without regard to whether any Participant rights may be considered to have been "adversely affected," the Committee or its delegate, to the extent permitted under the terms of the Plan, applicable law, the bylaws of the Company and under the Committee charter, may (among other permissible actions) change the Option Periods or Purchase Price, limit the frequency or number of changes in the amount withheld or contributed during an Option Period, establish the exchange rate applicable to amounts withheld or contributed in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding or contributions in excess of the amount designated by a Participant to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed Authorization Agreements, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock for each Participant properly correspond with the Participant's Authorization Agreement, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Committee deems appropriate. 
EXHIBIT B 
[BEGIN TABLE]
22.  Termination of the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
While it is intended that the Plan remain in effect indefinitely, the Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time in its discretion. The Plan shall be terminated by the Board of Directors if at any time the number of shares of Stock authorized for purposes of the Plan is not sufficient to meet all purchase requirements and the number of authorized shares is not increased to meet all prior purchase requirements at the next annual meeting of shareholders. Upon termination of the Plan, the Administrator shall give notice thereof to Participants, and shall terminate all Contributions and apportion the remaining available shares of Stock among Participants for purchase in accordance with the Plan in such manner as the Administrator may deem equitable. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
23.  Listing, Registration, and Qualification of Shares.  
[END TABLE]
Shares of Stock shall not be issued with respect to an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated under both sets of laws and the requirements of any Exchange, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  Options granted under the 423 Component of the Plan are exempt from the application of Section 409A of the  Code. Options granted under the Non-423 Component of the Plan to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A under the short-term deferral exception and any ambiguities  shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Subject to Section 24(b), Options granted to U.S. taxpayers under the Non-423 Component are subject to such terms and conditions that  will permit such options to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral exception available under Section 409A of the Code, including the requirement that the shares of Stock subject to an Option be delivered within the short-term  deferral period. Subject to Section 24(b), in the case of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent the Company determines that an Option or the exercise, payment, settlement or deferral is  subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Option shall be granted, exercised, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b)  Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify an Option for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the U.S. or  jurisdictions outside of the U.S. or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable  tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan. The Company is not constrained in its corporate activities by any potential negative tax impact on Participants under the Plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
25.  Employment Rights.  
[END TABLE]
Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor the grant of any Options thereunder nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to (a) give to an Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer, (b) interfere with the right of the Employer to discharge any Employee at any time, (c) give to the Employer the right to require the Employee to remain in its employ, or (d) interfere with the Employee's right to sever his employment at any time. 
EXHIBIT B

26.  Severability.  
[END TABLE]
If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or entity, or would disqualify the Plan under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or entity, and the remainder of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.
