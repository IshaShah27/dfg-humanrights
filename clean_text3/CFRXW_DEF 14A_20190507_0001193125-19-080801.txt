[END TABLE]
What items will be voted upon at the Annual Meeting? 
There are two items that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Election of Steven C. Gilman, Sol J. Barer, Isaac Blech, David N. Low, Jr., Michael J. Otto, Roger J. Pomerantz  and Cary W. Sucoff to the board of directors to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year  ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
We are not aware of any matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. If any matters not described in the Proxy Statement are properly presented at the meeting, the proxy holders will use their discretion to determine how to vote your shares.  Who can vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Stockholders of record of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), at the close of business on March 11, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, we had 79,409,556 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote. 
Who can attend the Annual Meeting? 
You may attend the Annual Meeting only if you are a ContraFect stockholder who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, or if you hold a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting. If you would like to attend the Annual Meeting, you must call (914) 207-2308 no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on May 3, 2019 to have your name placed on the attendance list. In order to be admitted into the Annual Meeting, your name must appear on the attendance list and you must present government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license). If your bank or broker holds your shares in street name, you will also be required to present proof of beneficial ownership of our Common Stock on the Record Date, such as a bank or brokerage statement or a letter from your bank or broker showing that you owned shares of our Common Stock at the close of business on the Record Date. 
What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting? 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held as of the Record Date. 
Difference between Stockholder of Record and Beneficial Owner 
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the notice of the Annual Meeting (the "Notice") and Proxy Statement were sent directly to you by the Company. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice and Proxy Statement were forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. 
How do I vote? 
Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by marking, signing and dating your proxy card and promptly returning it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided or returning it to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, 11219, so that it is received no later than May 6, 2019. The persons named as your proxy holders on the proxy card will vote the shares represented by your proxy in accordance with the specifications you make. Please carefully consider the information contained in this Proxy Statement. Whether or not you expect to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we urge you to vote by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card as promptly as possible in the postage-paid envelope provided, to ensure your representation and the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders of record desiring to vote in person at the Annual Meeting may vote on the ballot provided at the meeting. 
Beneficial Owners. If your shares are held in a brokerage account, by a bank, by a trustee, or by another nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker or other nominee. Most brokers or other   nominees permit their customers to vote by telephone or by Internet, in addition to voting by signing, dating and returning the voting instruction form provided by the broker or other nominee. 
Beneficial owners desiring to vote in person at the Annual Meeting will need to contact the broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee that is the holder of record of their shares to obtain a "legal proxy" to bring to the Annual Meeting. 
What are the voting recommendations of the board of directors? 
The board of directors recommends that our stockholders vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of Steven C. Gilman, Sol J. Barer, Isaac Blech, David N. Low, Jr., Michael J. Otto, Roger  J. Pomerantz and Cary W. Sucoff to serve until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal 1); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent  auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal 2).  
[END TABLE]
What if I do not specify how my shares are to be voted? 
Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a proxy, but you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of Steven C. Gilman, Sol J. Barer, Isaac Blech, David N. Low, Jr., Michael J. Otto, Roger  J. Pomerantz and Cary W. Sucoff as directors until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal 1); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent  auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal 2).  
[END TABLE]
No matter currently is expected to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the matters set forth in the accompanying Notice. However, if any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting for action, it is intended that the shares of our common stock represented by proxies will be voted by the persons named as proxies in their discretion on such matters. 
Beneficial Owners. If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or other nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under applicable rules, brokers or other nominees have discretionary voting power with respect to proposals that are considered "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" proposals. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your broker may only vote your shares on some, but not all, of the proposals to come before the Annual Meeting. See further below at "What are broker non-votes, and how will they affect the vote on a proposal?" 
Can I change or revoke my vote after I have delivered my proxy? 
Stockholders of Record. Prior to the Annual Meeting, you may change your vote by submitting a later dated proxy in one of the manners authorized and described in this Proxy Statement. You may also give a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, as long as it is delivered to our Corporate Secretary at our headquarters, at 28 Wells Avenue, Third Floor, Yonkers, New York 10701, on or before May 6, 2019, or given to our Corporate Secretary at the Annual Meeting prior to the time your proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting. You also may revoke any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person by ballot. However, the mere presence of a stockholder at the Annual Meeting will not revoke a proxy previously given unless you follow one of the revocation procedures referenced above.  Beneficial Owners. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, please follow the instructions provided by your broker or other nominee as to how you may change your vote or obtain a "legal proxy" to vote your shares if you wish to cast your vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
How can I communicate with the board of directors? 
Our board will give appropriate attention to written communications that are submitted by stockholders, and will respond if and as appropriate. If you wish to communicate with the board of directors, you may send your communication in writing to: General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, ContraFect Corporation, 28 Wells Avenue, Third Floor, Yonkers, New York 10701, who will forward all material communications from stockholders to the appropriate director or directors or committee of the board of directors based on the subject matter. You must include your name and address in the written communication and indicate whether you are a stockholder of the Company. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal     Votes required     Effect of Votes Withheld / Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
Proposal 1: Election of Directors    The plurality of the votes cast. This means that the seven nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative "FOR" votes will be elected as directors.     Votes withheld and broker non-votes will have no effect 
Proposal 2: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.     Abstentions will have no effect. We do not  expect any broker non-votes on this proposal. 
Proposal 2: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.     Abstentions will have no effect. We do not  expect any broker non-votes on this proposal. 
[END TABLE]
How are abstentions and votes withheld treated? 
A "vote withheld," in the case of the proposal regarding the election of directors, or an "abstention," with respect to the proposal regarding the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor, are treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Votes withheld have no effect on the election of directors and abstentions have no effect on the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor. 
What are broker non-votes, and how will they affect the vote on a proposal? 
Broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. A broker non-vote occurs when you fail to provide voting instructions for shares you hold in "street name." Under those circumstances, your broker may be authorized to vote for you on routine matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor, but is prohibited from voting on other, non-routine matters, such as the election of directors. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for the election of directors. Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with such proposals. Those items for which your broker cannot vote result in broker non-votes if you do not provide your broker with voting instructions on such items. 
How are votes counted? 
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting by the board of directors. The inspector of election will separately count "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes, votes withheld,   abstentions and broker non-votes. The board of directors has appointed a representative of American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC to serve as the inspector of elections at the Annual Meeting. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
The final voting results will be reported in a Form 8-K that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") within four business days of the Annual Meeting, and that Form 8-K will be available via the SEC Filings section of our website. We also expect to announce preliminary results at the Annual Meeting. 
Who is paying for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
The expenses of preparing, printing and assembling the materials used in the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the board of directors will be borne by the Company. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of the mail, the Company may use the services of certain of its officers and employees (who will receive no compensation in addition to their regular salaries) to solicit proxies personally and by mail, telephone and electronic means from brokerage firms and other stockholders. 
Is there other business scheduled to be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting? 
Stockholders at an annual meeting will only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the Notice of Annual Meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a stockholder of record on the Record Date for the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has delivered timely written notice in proper form to our Corporate Secretary of the stockholder's intention to bring such business before the meeting. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company has no knowledge of any business to be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals described in the Notice of Annual Meeting. If any other business should properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons appointed by the enclosed form of proxy shall have discretionary authority to vote all such proxies as they shall decide. The enclosed proxy gives Natalie Bogdanos, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and Michael Messinger, Chief Financial Officer, discretionary authority to vote your shares in accordance with his or her best judgment with respect to all additional matters that might come before the Annual Meeting, provided that the enclosed proxy is properly authorized by you. 
Stockholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting 
Rule 14a-8 Proposals 
To be eligible for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, must be received at the Company's principal executive offices no later than December 5, 2019. Stockholder proposals should be addressed to: ContraFect Corporation, Attn: Corporate Secretary, 28 Wells Avenue, Third Floor, Yonkers, New York 10701. 
Other Proposals or Nominees for Presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting 
Stockholder proposals and director nominations not intended for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, but which instead are sought to be presented directly at such meeting, must be received at the Company's principal executive offices by our Secretary not less than ninety (90) calendar days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Therefore, the Company must receive notice of such a proposal or nomination for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders no earlier than the close of business on January 8, 2020 and no later than the close of business on February 7, 2020 to be considered timely. In the event that the date of the 2020 annual   meeting of stockholders is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after May 7, 2020, then our Secretary must receive such written notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the 2020 annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the 2020 annual meeting or, if later, the 10th day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company. Proxies will confer discretionary authority to vote on any untimely proposals or nominations.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our board of directors currently consists of seven directors. The authorized number of directors is determined from time to time by the board of directors, provided that our board must consist of at least one member. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended, and the board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors on the board) has nominated, seven individuals as director nominees for the Annual Meeting. These director nominees are: Steven C. Gilman, Sol J. Barer, Isaac Blech, David N. Low, Jr., Michael J. Otto, Roger J. Pomerantz and Cary W. Sucoff. 
The board of directors has determined that each of Dr. Barer, Mr. Blech, Mr. Low, Dr. Otto, Dr. Pomerantz, and Mr. Sucoff is an "independent director" as defined by the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC ("Nasdaq"). The board of directors has determined that Dr. Gilman is not an "independent director" as defined by the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq as he serves as our Chief Executive Officer. If elected at the Annual Meeting, each director will hold office until the Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 and until his respective successor is duly elected and qualified. 
If you submit a proxy but do not indicate any voting instructions, the persons named as proxies will vote the shares of common stock represented thereby for the election as directors the persons whose names and biographies appear below. All of the persons whose names and biographies appear below are currently serving as our directors. If any nominee should become unable to serve or for good cause will not serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, proxies will be voted for any substitute nominee designated by the board of directors, taking into account any recommendation by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, to fill the vacancy, or the board of directors may elect to reduce its size. Each nominee has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected.

Required Vote 
The election of each of the above director nominees requires the approval of a plurality of the votes cast in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. This means that the seven nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative "FOR" votes will be elected as directors. Votes withheld and broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast and, accordingly, will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on this proposal. 
The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR'' the election of the above director nominees.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director Independence 
Except as may otherwise be permitted by the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq, a majority of the members of the board of directors shall be independent directors. The board of directors has determined that Dr. Barer, Mr. Blech, Mr. Low, Dr. Otto, Dr. Pomerantz and Mr. Sucoff qualify as independent directors under the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. The board of directors has also determined that each director who currently serves on the Audit Committee is independent under the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and that each director who currently serves on the Compensation Committee meets Nasdaq's heightened standard of independence applicable to compensation committee members, and that each director who currently serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent under the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. The board of directors has determined that Dr. Gilman is not independent under the applicable Nasdaq listing standards as he serves as our Chief Executive Officer. 
Director Nominations 
The board of directors nominates directors for election at each annual meeting of stockholders and elects new directors to fill vacancies when they arise. Except where the Company is legally required by contract, by-law or otherwise to provide third parties with the right to nominate directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the identification of individuals qualified to become directors and the recommendation of nominees for election to the board of directors. In making such recommendations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates proposed by stockholders of the Company, and reviews and evaluates information available to it regarding such candidates according to the same criteria and processes as it does in considering other candidates. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors considered as a group should provide a significant breadth of experience, knowledge and abilities that will assist the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities. The value of diversity is taken into consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee when considering director nominees. In furtherance of that objective, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has a number of criteria in the evaluation of director nominees. Director nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that director nominees should have demonstrated business acumen, experience and ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and long-term objectives of the Company and should be willing and able to contribute positively to the decision-making process of the Company. Additionally, director nominees should have a commitment to understand the Company and its industry and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the board of directors and its committees. Furthermore, director nominees should have the interest and ability to understand the sometimes conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the Company, which include stockholders, employees, customers, governmental units, creditors and the general public, and to act in the interests of all stockholders. Director nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all the Company's stockholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not assign specific weight to particular criteria, nor has it adopted a particular policy. 
Stockholders may recommend individuals to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting the names of the recommended individuals, together with appropriate biographical information and background materials, to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, 28 Wells Avenue, Third Floor, Yonkers, New York 10701.  Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines provide our board of directors with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure would be in the best interests of our Company. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines further provide that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will periodically assess the board of directors' leadership structure, including whether the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be separate. As a result of the appointment of our Chairman of the Board, Steven C. Gilman, as Chief Executive Officer in March 2016, we combined these leadership positions. Sol Barer serves as our Lead Independent Director. In this role, Dr. Barer assists the Chairman of the Board with his leadership and oversight responsibilities and acts as the liaison between the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. 
Both the full board of directors and its committees oversee the various risks faced by the Company. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company's risks and provides periodic reports to the board of directors and its committees relating to those risks and risk-mitigation efforts. The board of directors' oversight of risk is conducted primarily through the standing committees of the board of directors, the members of which are all independent directors, with the Audit Committee taking a lead role on oversight of financial risks and in interfacing with management on significant risks or exposures, including cybersecurity risks, and assessing the steps management has taken to minimize such risks. The Audit Committee also is charged with, among other tasks, oversight of management on the Company's guidelines and policies to govern the process by which the Company's exposure to risk is handled. Members of the Company's management, including our chief financial officer, periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding risks overseen by the Audit Committee, including quarterly with respect to the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Compensation Committee, in consultation with management, has reviewed the design and operation of the Company's compensation arrangements and evaluated the relationship between the Company's risk management policies and practices and these arrangements. As a result of this review, the Compensation Committee has determined that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Our board of directors does not believe that its role in the oversight of our risks affects the board's leadership structure. 
Attendance at Board of Directors, Committee and Annual Stockholder Meetings 
Directors are responsible for attending board of directors meetings, meetings of committees on which they serve and the annual meetings of the stockholders, and devoting the time needed, and meeting as frequently as necessary, to discharge their responsibilities properly. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our board of directors held five (5) meetings, four (4) Audit Committee meetings, four (4) Compensation Committee meetings, three (3) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meetings and two (2) Science and Technology Committee meetings. Our independent directors also had regularly scheduled executive sessions. All directors attended at least 75% of the board of directors meetings and committee meetings that were held during that period during which he or she was a director of the Company and in which he or she was a member of such committees. All of the directors who were nominated for election at the meeting attended the Company's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.  Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our board of directors has established four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Science and Technology Committee. The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operate pursuant to written charters that are available on the Corporate Governance page of our website at http://ir.contrafect.com/governance-docs.

All of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors, including after giving consideration to the factors specified in the Nasdaq listing rules for compensation committee independence. The Compensation Committee held four (4) meetings in 2018. Our Compensation Committee assists our board of directors in the discharge of its responsibilities relating to the compensation of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee's responsibilities include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Subject to the terms of our compensation plans, the Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the amount, form, structure and implementation of compensation payable to our executive officers, including, where appropriate, discretion to increase or decrease awards or to award compensation absent the attainment of performance goals and to award discretionary cash compensation outside of the parameters of our compensation plans. In exercising such discretion, the Compensation Committee consults with our management and may engage an independent compensation consultant from time to time. Our Chief Executive Officer annually reviews the performance of each of the other executive officers relative to individual and corporate annual performance goals established for the year. The Chief Executive Officer then presents his or her compensation recommendations based on these reviews to the Compensation Committee. To the extent permitted by and consistent with applicable law and the provisions of a given equity-based plan, the Compensation Committee may delegate to one or more subcommittees or executive officers of the Company the power to grant options or other stock awards pursuant to such equity-based plan to employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company who are not directors or executive officers of the Company. 
Role of Compensation Consultants 
The Compensation Committee uses the services of external compensation consultants to obtain relevant information on compensation practices and trends within the peer group and among the broader market. 
Beginning in 2015, and as it related to the process for developing executive and director compensation for subsequent years, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford Surveys ("Radford"), a division of Aon Corporation, as its compensation consultant. Radford was engaged by, and reported directly to, the Compensation Committee. Management did not participate in the selection process for the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee is not aware of any conflict of interest on the part of Radford or any factor that would otherwise impair the independence of Radford relating to the services it performed for the Compensation Committee. Radford does not perform any other services for the Company. 
In its advisory role, Radford assisted the Compensation Committee in the design and implementation of our executive and director compensation programs. This included advising the Compensation Committee with respect to the competitiveness of our executive and director compensation program in comparison to industry practices, and the identification of any trends in executive and director compensation in our peer group. The Compensation Committee considered the market comparison data and peer group data in making compensation decisions. Radford also assisted the Compensation Committee in selecting the key elements to include in its compensation program and the establishment of performance targets.  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee had three (3) meetings in 2018. All of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's responsibilities include:

We have elected to provide compensation disclosure pursuant to the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. 
Our executive compensation program, consisting of a three-part compensation strategy that includes base salary, annual performance- based cash bonuses and long-term equity incentive compensation, is designed to (i) pay for performance to encourage both Company and individual achievement; (ii) encourage efficient use of Company resources; and (iii) provide market competitive compensation to attract and retain highly qualified individuals who are capable of making significant contributions to the long-term success of the Company. 
The Company does not adopt express formulae for weighting different elements of compensation or for allocating between long-term and short-term compensation but strives to develop comprehensive packages that are competitive with those offered by other companies with which the Company competes to attract and retain talented executives. Under the Company's compensation practices, cash compensation consists of an annual base salary and performance-based bonuses, and equity-based compensation primarily consists of grants of stock options.

 Employment Arrangements 
Steven C. Gilman 
During 2018, Dr. Gilman served as our President and Chief Executive Officer under the terms of a letter agreement entered into on July 21, 2016, and amended effective as of May 29, 2018 (together, the "Gilman Agreement"). The current term of the Gilman Agreement expires on July 1, 2019, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with its terms, and entitles Dr. Gilman to receive base salary payments at the annualized rate of $525,000 as well as the opportunity to earn an annual performance-based bonus targeted at 75% of his base salary, with the ability to earn a bonus of up to 125% of his base salary for exceeding targeted performance. 
Dr. Gilman has also agreed to serve as Chairman of our board of directors, without additional compensation, for any period during the term of the Gilman Agreement that he is elected to serve as a Board member, and we have agreed to nominate Dr. Gilman for reelection to our board of directors by our stockholders upon any expiration of the term of Dr. Gilman's board service that occurs during the term of the Gilman Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing on September 21, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2018 (regardless of Dr. Gilman's continued employment), we offered Dr. Gilman and his eligible spouse and dependents medical, dental and vision insurance coverage at substantially the same benefit levels as provided from time to time to active executive officers of ours and to pay the full premiums for such coverage. Dr. Gilman is subject to non-competition and employee non-solicitation covenants during the term of the Gilman Agreement and thereafter through December 31, 2019. 
If, during the term of the Gilman Agreement, we terminate Dr. Gilman's employment without "cause" or Dr. Gilman resigns his employment for "good reason" (as these terms are defined in the Gilman Agreement), subject to Dr. Gilman signing and not revoking a general release of claims, Dr. Gilman will be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment in an amount equal to $300,000 (or, if the employment termination occurs on or within 12 months following a change in control, 150% of his then-current base salary) and accelerated vesting of all of his unvested stock options that are subject solely to service-based vesting conditions. Additionally, upon termination of Dr. Gilman's employment for any reason during the term of the Gilman Agreement, any vested stock options held by Dr. Gilman as of the employment termination date will generally remain exercisable for two years. Dr. Gilman's right to receive severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon his timely executing a general release of claims. 
Cara M. Cassino 
On August 24, 2015, we entered into an offer letter agreement with Dr. Cassino, our Chief Medical Officer, and amended the agreement on August 22, 2016 and again on March 15, 2017 (together, the "Cassino Offer Letter"). During 2018, Dr. Cassino was paid an annual base salary of $469,809 and was eligible to earn a target annual performance bonus in an amount equal to 45% of her base salary. Effective January 1, 2019, Dr. Cassino's annual base salary was increased to $483,903. 
The Cassino Offer Letter also entitles Dr. Cassino to the following severance payments and benefits upon her resignation for good reason or termination by us without cause: (i) an amount equal to the sum of 18 months of Dr. Cassino's then-current base salary plus 150% of Dr. Cassino's then-current target annual bonus, payable over 18 months following the date of termination, (ii) payment of any earned but unpaid bonuses, (iii) payment of the applicable premiums for coverage pursuant to COBRA for 18 months from the date of the termination and (iv) accelerated vesting of any then-outstanding Company stock options granted prior to June 14, 2016, with the vested portion of such stock options remaining outstanding and exercisable until the date that is two (2) years following Dr. Cassino's employment termination date, subject to the earlier final expiration dates of such options or treatment in accordance with their contractual terms in connection with certain corporate transaction. 
Dr. Cassino's right to receive severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon her timely executing a general release of claims.  Natalie Bogdanos 
On June 26, 2014, we entered into an offer letter agreement with Natalie Bogdanos, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and amended the agreement on November 2, 2015 (together, the "Bogdanos Offer Letter"). During 2018, Ms. Bogdanos was paid an annual base salary of $378,268 and was eligible to earn a target annual performance bonus in an amount equal to 30% of her base salary. Effective January 1, 2019, Ms. Bogdanos's annual base salary was increased to $389,616. 
The Bogdanos Offer Letter entitles Ms. Bogdanos to the following severance payments and benefits upon her termination by us without cause or her resignation for good reason: (i) base salary continuation for 12 months following the date of termination; (ii) a payment equal to 12 months of bonus; and (iii) payment of the applicable premiums for coverage pursuant to COBRA for 12 months from the date of termination for Ms. Bogdanos and her dependents. In the event that Ms. Bogdanos is terminated by us without cause or resigns for good reason, in each case, within one year following a change of control event, then, in addition to those benefits described above, all existing and outstanding stock options and other equity awards will become immediately fully vested and exercisable. Ms. Bogdanos's right to receive severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon her timely executing a general release of claims. 
Ms. Bogdanos has agreed not to divert certain corporate opportunities and not to solicit certain of our employees for one year following the termination of her employment. 
2018 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards 
Each Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive an annual non-equity incentive plan award based on performance. This award is based on the achievement of individual performance goals and Company goals, determined by our Compensation Committee at the beginning of each year. Each Named Executive Officer has a target maximum annual award amount, expressed as a percentage of the Named Executive Officer's base salary. In 2018, Dr. Gilman was eligible to receive a non-equity incentive plan award targeted at 75% of his base salary, or $393,750. The amount of this award was based upon the level of achievement of pre-determined corporate goals comprising activities necessary to achieve certain pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory, research and financial milestones of the Company, and his performance as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Dr. Cassino was eligible to receive a non-equity incentive plan award targeted at 45% of her base salary, or $211,414. The amount of this award was based upon the level of achievement of pre-determined goals, comprised of 70% corporate goals, and 30% individual goals. These performance-based goals included, but were not limited to, activities necessary to achieve certain pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory, research and financial milestones of the Company. Ms. Bogdanos was eligible to receive a non-equity incentive plan award targeted at 30% of her base salary, or $113,480. The amount of this award was based upon the level of achievement of pre-determined goals, comprised of 70% corporate goals, and 30% individual goals. These performance-based goals included, but were not limited to, activities necessary for the Company to achieve certain pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory, research and financial milestones, and activities required for the Company's successful operation as a publicly traded company. 
As soon as practical after the year is completed, our Compensation Committee reviews actual performance against the stated Company goals and individual goals and determines subjectively what it believes to be the appropriate level of the award, if any, for the Named Executive Officers. 
In February 2019, our Compensation Committee reviewed the performance of the Company and of each individual executive against the 2018 Company and individual goals and objectives and elected to pay non-equity incentive plan awards to the Named Executive Officers. The cash amounts awarded to each Named Executive Officer for 2018 performance are set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in the column entitled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation."  Equity and Other Compensation Plans 
We generally offer stock options to our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, as the long-term incentive component of our compensation program. Our stock options generally allow employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and may be intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Our stock options typically vest either (a) as to 25% of the shares subject to the option on the first anniversary of the date of grant and in equal quarterly installments over the ensuing 36 months or (b) as to all of the shares subject to the option, ratably on a quarterly basis over a four-year period following the date of grant, in either case subject to the holder's continued employment with us as of each applicable vesting date. From time to time, our board of directors may also construct alternate vesting schedules as it determines are appropriate to motivate particular employees. 
We awarded stock options to our Named Executive Officers during 2018 in the following amounts: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    2018 Options Granted   
 Steven C. Gilman, Ph.D.      250,000   
 Cara M. Cassino, M.D.      230,000

[END TABLE]

401(k) Retirement Plan 
We maintain a retirement plan that is intended to be a tax-qualified defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, all of our employees are eligible to participate beginning on the first day of their employment. The 401(k) plan includes a salary deferral arrangement pursuant to which participants may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed limit, generally equal to $18,500 for 2018, and have the amount of the reduction contributed to the 401(k) plan. The Company has implemented a cash matching program whereby it contributes, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, an amount equal to 50% of employee contributions up to 3% of an employee's salary.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Indemnification Agreements 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers in which we agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and also advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, from damage arising from the fact that such person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. We maintain insurance policies for director and officer liability providing for maximum coverage in the amount of $20 million. 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
Our board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or 1 percent of the average of the Company's total assets at fiscal year-end for the last two completed years, and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5% stockholders, or their immediate family members, each of whom we refer to as a "related person", has a direct or indirect material interest. 
Company management is responsible for determining whether a transaction meets the requirements of a related person transaction requiring review under the related person transaction policy. If review is deemed to be required under the policy, it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to review related person transactions and approve, ratify, revise or reject related person transactions. The Audit Committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances and will only ratify those transactions that are in our best interests. If a related party transaction involves a related person who is a director or immediate family member of a director, such director may not participate in the deliberations or vote respecting such transaction; provided, however, that such director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Audit Committee which considers such transaction. If management determines it is impractical or undesirable to wait until an Audit Committee meeting to consummate a transaction with a related person, the chairperson of the Audit Committee may approve the transaction with the related person. Any such approval must be reported to the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting. 
The following transactions involving related persons are pre-approved under the related party transaction policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any employment by us of an executive officer, if: (i) the related compensation is required to be reported in  our proxy statement under Item 402 of the SEC's compensation disclosure requirements (generally applicable to "named executive officers"); or (ii) the executive officer is not an immediate family member of another related person, the  related compensation would be reported in our proxy statement under Item 402 of the SEC's compensation disclosure requirements if the executive officer was a "named executive officer," and the Compensation Committee approved (or  recommended that the Board approve) such compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any compensation or benefits paid to a director for service as a director, as long as such compensation or  benefits is required to be reported in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K and has been approved by the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any transaction with another company at which a related person does not have any relationship other than as a  director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that company's shares, or a partnership in which the related person and all other related persons, in the aggregate, have an interest of less than 10%, and the related person is not a general  partner of and does not have another position in the partnership, in each case if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 5 percent of the other company's or partnership's total annual revenues;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by us to a charitable organization, foundation or university in  which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     officer), or a director or trustee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 5 percent of the charitable organization's total annual receipts;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any transaction where the related person's interest arises solely from the ownership of a class of our  equity securities and all holders of that class of equity securities received the same benefit on a pro rata basis (e.g., dividends); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any transaction involving a related person where the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive  bids.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the board of directors, which is reviewed at least annually. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the Corporate Governance page of our website at http://ir.contrafect.com/governance-docs. The members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. David N. Low, Jr. (Chairman), Roger J. Pomerantz, M.D., F.A.C.P. and Cary W. Sucoff, each of whom meets the independence standards established by Nasdaq and the rules of the SEC. 
The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the board of directors and is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of our accounting, auditing, financial reporting, internal control and legal compliance functions. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management is responsible for our financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible in its report for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the various communications that such independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide to the Audit Committee, including those matters required by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from the Company. 
Based upon the reviews and discussions outlined above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and Nasdaq. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all copies of Section 16(a) forms they file. Specific due dates for these reports have been established and we are required to identify in this proxy statement those persons who failed to timely file these reports. Based solely on our review of these forms and written representations from the officers and directors received by us, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were complied with in a timely fashion.  PAYMENT OF COSTS 
The expense of printing and mailing proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies will be borne by us. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, solicitation may be made by our directors, officers and other employees by personal interview, telephone or facsimile. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or employees for such solicitation. We will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to beneficial owners of our common stock.
