                      Include all independent directors on the Compensation Committee.                        Allow executives or independent directors to short-sell the Company stock or hedge to offset a possible decrease in the market value of Company stock held by them.  
                      Impose stock ownership and retention requirements on our independent directors, NEOs, and other select members of senior management.                        Enter into change-in-control agreements with any of our executive officers.  
                      Emphasize variable compensation, including long-term equity incentive compensation.                        Provide excise tax gross-ups.  
                      Award RSUs that are subject to a 12-month objective performance-based earning period and a five-year ratable vesting schedule. In 2019, performance-based RSUs will be                  subject to a three-year performance goal.                        Enter into broad-based employment agreements with our United States-based executive officers.  
                      Impose double-trigger vesting on acceleration of awards granted under our 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2012 Incentive Plan) in the event we are acquired or taken over by                  another company.                        Pay dividends on unearned performance-based RSUs.  
                      Engage an independent compensation consultant who provides services only to the Compensation Committee and provides no other services to the Company or its management.                        Accelerate the vesting of equity awards on an executive officer's retirement.  
                      Use a comprehensive risk management program designed to identify, evaluate, and control risks and our compensation and stock ownership programs work within this risk                  management framework.                        Permit the repricing or exchange of equity awards in any scenario without stockholder approval.  
                      Have a recoupment policy for both cash and equity incentive compensation in place for executive officers in the event of a material restatement of our financial results                  within three years of the original reporting.                        Sponsor any supplemental executive retirement plans or provide significant perquisites and other personal benefits to our executive officers.
