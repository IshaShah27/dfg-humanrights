QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Why did I receive this proxy statement? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The Board is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting because you were a member of the Company at the close of business on February 22, 2019, the record date, and are entitled to vote at the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: When and where is the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The 2019 Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, April 4, 2019, at the Waucoma Event Center, 308 Riverview Drive, Waucoma, Iowa 52171.  Registration and lunch will begin at 11:30 a.m.  The 2019 Annual Meeting will commence at approximately 12:30 p.m.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What am I voting on? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You are voting on the election of three directors to the Board.  The nominees for the director election are Patrick Boyle, Nick Bowdish, and Chad Kuhlers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How many votes do I have? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: On any matter which may properly come before the meeting, each member entitled to vote will have one vote for each membership unit owned of record by such member as of the close of business on February 22, 2019.  For the director election, each open director seat is considered a separate matter so members will be able to vote for three nominees for each unit owned of record as of the record date.  Pursuant to the requirements of the Company's Amended and Restated Operating Agreement dated April 4, 2013, as amended (the "Operating Agreement"), any member entitled to directly appoint a director to the Board is precluded from voting in the general election of directors.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the voting requirement to elect the directors and what is the effect of a withhold vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In the election of directors, the three nominees receiving the greatest number of votes relative to the votes cast for their competitors will be elected, regardless of whether any individual nominee receives votes from a majority of the quorum.  Members do not have cumulative voting rights.  In the director election, because directors are elected by plurality vote, withheld votes will not be counted either FOR or AGAINST any nominee.  Withheld votes will be included when counting units to determine whether a sufficient number of the voting membership units are represented to establish a quorum.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Do I have dissenters' rights? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Pursuant to Section 6.19 of the Operating Agreement, members have no dissenters' rights.  Dissenters' rights are generally the right of a security holder to dissent from and obtain the fair value for their securities in certain events, such as mergers, share exchanges, and certain amendments to a company's governance agreements. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How many membership units are outstanding? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: On February 22, 2019, the record date, there were 90,420 outstanding membership units.  However, the Company and Steve Retterath signed an agreement in June 2013 pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed that the Company would repurchase and retire Mr. Retterath's entire interest in the Company.  Mr. Retterath subsequently refused to complete the repurchase by the August 1, 2013 closing date.  The Company believes that it has a binding agreement with Mr. Retterath and has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Retterath to require him to complete the membership unit repurchase.  Mr. Retterath contends he is not bound by the agreement.  The Company's position is that as of the closing date, Mr. Retterath is no longer the equitable owner of any membership units in the Company.  Golden Grain Energy, LLC will also not be permitted to vote in the general director election since it is an "Appointing Member" pursuant to the Operating Agreement.  This means that there may be 59,560 votes for the general election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What constitutes a quorum? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The presence of members holding 30% of the total outstanding membership units entitled to vote on the matters presented, or 17,876 membership units for the director election constitutes a quorum.  If you submit a properly executed proxy card, then you will be counted as part of the quorum.       
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Membership units can be voted only if the holder of record is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy.  You may vote using either of the following methods: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy card.  You may cast your votes by executing a proxy card for the 2019 Annual Meeting and submitting it to the Company prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Completed proxy cards must be RECEIVED by the Company by 5:00 p.m. local time on Wednesday, April 3, 2019 in order to be valid.  The Company urges you to specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on your proxy card for the 2019 Annual Meeting.  After you have marked your choices, please sign and date the proxy card and return it to the Company, either by mail at 2779 Highway 24, Lawler, Iowa 52154, or fax it to the Company at (563) 238-5557.  If you sign and return the proxy card without specifying any choices, your membership units will be voted FOR the incumbent directors Patrick Boyle, Nick Bowdish and Chad Kuhlers. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  All members of record as of February 22, 2019 entitled to vote on the matters presented may vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my units? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You may revoke your proxy by: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Giving written notice of the revocation to the Company's CFO, Beth Eiler, prior to the commencement of the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What happens if I mark too few or too many boxes on the proxy card? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If you do not mark any choices on the proxy card, then the proxies will vote your units FOR the incumbent directors Patrick Boyle, Nick Bowdish and Chad Kuhlers. You may wish to vote for only one or two of the director nominee(s). In this case, your vote will only be counted for the director nominee(s) you have selected. If you mark contradicting choices on the proxy card, such as both FOR and WITHHOLD for a nominee, your vote will not be counted with respect to the director nominee for which you marked contradicting choices. However, each fully executed proxy card will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]

In addition, a member who is entitled to vote in the director election can nominate a candidate for director by following the procedures explained in Section 5.3(b) of the Operating Agreement.  Section 5.3(b) of the Operating Agreement requires that written notice of a member's intent to nominate an individual for director must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Company not less than 120 calendar days prior to the one year anniversary of the date when the Company's proxy statement was released in connection with the previous year's annual meeting. Director nominations submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Operating Agreement must be submitted to the Company by October 25, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is a member proposal? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: A member proposal is your recommendation or requirement that the Company and/or the Board take action, which you intend to present at a meeting of the Company's members.  Your proposal should state as clearly as possible the course of action that you believe the Company should follow.  If your proposal is included in the Company's proxy statement, then the Company must also provide the means for members to vote on the matter via the proxy card.  The deadlines and procedures for submitting member proposals are explained in the following question and answer.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: When are member proposals due for the 2020 annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In order to be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, member proposals must be submitted in writing to the Company by October 25, 2019.  The Company suggests that proposals for the 2020 annual meeting of the members be submitted by certified mail-return receipt requested.    
[END TABLE]
Members who intend to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of members without including such proposal in the Company's proxy statement, must provide the Company notice of such proposal no later than January 8, 2020.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.
If the Company does not receive notice of a member proposal intended to be submitted to the 2020 annual meeting by January 8, 2020, the persons named on the proxy card accompanying the notice of meeting may vote on any such proposal  in their discretion, provided the Company has included in its proxy statement an explanation of its intention with respect to voting on the proposal.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the effect of a broker non-vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: While we do not believe that any of our units are held in street name by brokers, broker non-votes, if any, will count for purposes of establishing a quorum at the 2019 Annual Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when an individual owns units which are held in the name of a broker. The individual is the beneficial owner of the units, however, on the records of the Company, the broker owns the units. If the individual who beneficially owns the units does not provide the broker with voting instructions on non-routine matters, including the proposals presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, this is considered a broker non-vote. For such non-routine matters, the broker cannot vote either way and reports the units as "non-votes." These broker non-votes function as abstentions under our governing documents. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The entire cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by the Company.  The cost will include the cost of supplying necessary additional copies of the solicitation materials for beneficial owners of membership units held of record by brokers, dealers, banks and voting trustees and their nominees and, upon request, the reasonable expenses of such record holders for completing the mailing of such material and report to such beneficial owners.                                             
[END TABLE]

Required Vote and Board Recommendation
Each member entitled to vote in the general election of directors may vote for three nominees for each unit the member owns.  As indicated on the proxy card, if you do not mark any choices for directors on the proxy card, then your votes will be cast FOR Nick Bowdish, Patrick Boyle, and Chad Kuhlers.  Withheld votes for director elections will not be counted either for or against any nominee because directors are elected by plurality vote, meaning that the persons receiving the greatest number of votes relative to the other nominees will be elected.  If you mark only one or two choices on the proxy card for the director election, the proxies will vote your units ONLY for the nominee(s) you have selected.  If you mark contradicting choices on the proxy card, such as both FOR and WITHHOLD for a nominee, your votes will not be counted with respect to the director nominee(s) for whom you have marked contradicting choices. If any nominee should withdraw or otherwise become unavailable, which is not expected, such nominee's votes will be disregarded in determining which nominees received the greatest number of votes.  Members who neither submit a proxy card nor attend the meeting will not be counted as either a vote for or against any nominee in the election of directors.  Any member entitled to vote who submits a signed proxy card will be treated as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Each of the members of the Company who beneficially own 5% or more of the Company's units has sole voting and sole investment power for all units beneficially owned by that member.  Each of our 5% owners can be contacted at the Company's address, Homeland Energy Solutions, LLC, 2779 Highway 24, Lawler, Iowa 52154.
The Company and Steve Retterath, who is listed below as a 5% or more owner, signed an agreement in June 2013 pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed that the Company would repurchase and retire Mr. Retterath's entire interest in the Company.  Mr. Retterath subsequently refused to complete the repurchase by the August 1, 2013 closing date.  The Company believes that it has a binding agreement with Mr. Retterath and has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Retterath to require him to complete the membership unit repurchase.  Mr. Retterath contends he is not bound by the agreement.  The Company's position is as of the closing date, Mr. Retterath is no longer the equitable owner of any membership units in the Company, but until the court has a chance to rule on this and the other issues raised in the litigation, the Company will accept Mr. Retterath's proxy card or allow him to vote in person  at the 2019 Annual Meeting on any matters presented for which he is entitled to vote, without conceding that he is entitled to vote or that he has any equitable interest in the Company.
As of February 22, 2019, the following members beneficially owned 5% or more of our outstanding units, subject to the Company's position with respect to Mr. Retterath as set forth above:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES
The Board generally meets once per month.  The Board held twelve regularly scheduled and four special meeting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 during the time each served on the Board.  
The Board does not have a formalized process for holders of membership units to send communications to the Board. The Board feels this is reasonable given the accessibility of our directors.  Members who wish to communicate with the Board are free to do so by contacting a director.  The names of our directors are listed on the Company's website at www.homelandenergysolutions.com or are available by calling the Company's office at (563) 238-5555.  
The Board does not have a policy with regard to director attendance at annual meetings. Last year, all of the directors attended the Company's annual meeting.  Due to this high attendance record, it is the view of the Board that such a policy is unnecessary.
Director Independence
During our 2018 fiscal year, all of our directors and director nominees were independent, as defined by NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2).  In evaluating the independence of our directors and nominees, we considered the following factors as set forth in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2): (i) the business relationships of our directors and nominees; (ii) positions our directors and nominees hold with other companies; (iii) family relationships between our directors and nominees and other individuals involved with the Company; (iv) transactions between our directors/nominees and the Company; and (v) compensation arrangements between our directors/nominees and the Company. 
Board Leadership Structure and Role In Risk Oversight
The Company is managed by a management team which oversees each area of our operations in which such manager has expertise.  Our management team consists of our President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Commodities Manager/Vice-President, Chief Operating Officer, and our Human Resources Manager.  The Chairman of our Board is separate from our Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for coordinating the management efforts of our managers.  The Board has determined that its leadership structure is effective to create checks and balances between the executive officers of the Company and the Board.  The Board is actively involved in overseeing all material risks that face the Company, including risks related to changes in commodity prices.  The Board administers its oversight functions by reviewing the operations of the Company, by overseeing the executive officers' management of the Company, and through its risk management committee.  
Code of Ethics
The Board has adopted a Code of Ethics that sets forth standards regarding matters such as honest and ethical conduct, compliance with the law, and full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications.  The Code of Ethics applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  The Code of Ethics is available free of charge on written request to Homeland Energy Solutions, LLC, 2779 Highway 24, Lawler, Iowa 52154.  
Audit Committee
The Company has a separately-designated standing audit committee.  The audit committee of the Board operates under a charter adopted by the Board in February 2009.  A copy of the audit committee charter is available on the Company's website, www.homelandenergysolutions.com.  Under the charter, the audit committee must have at least three members.  Our audit committee members are Christine Marchand, Steven Core, Patrick Boyle (Chair), Mathew Driscoll and Leslie Hansen.  The audit committee held four meetings during the Company's 2018 fiscal year.  Each of the members of the audit committee attended at least 75% of the audit committee meetings except Leslie Hansen who attended one meeting.  
The audit committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  Our audit committee charter requires a majority of our audit committee to be "independent" in accordance with the definition provided for in such charter.   All of our audit committee members are independent within the definition of independence  provided by NASDAQ rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2).  The Board has determined that Christine Marchand qualifies as an audit committee financial expert based on her prior education and position as the Chief Financial Officer of a publicly reporting company.
Audit Committee Report
The audit committee delivered the following report to the Board on February 20, 2019. The following report of the audit committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any previous or future documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the report by reference in any such document.
The audit committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles. The committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The committee has discussed with RSM US LLP its independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 61, Communications with Audit Committees. The committee has received from the independent registered public accounting firm written disclosures regarding the auditors' independence required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Independence Rule 3526, Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm, the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. The committee has considered whether the provision of services by RSM US LLP, not related to the audit of the financial statements referred to above and to the reviews of the interim financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q are compatible with maintaining RSM US LLP's independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

RSM US LLP has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2010. In support of the reappointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the audit committee considered the following factors:

One hundred percent of all audit services, audit-related services and tax-related services were pre-approved by our audit committee. 
Nominating Committee
The Board appointed Christine Marchand (Chair), Steven Core, Maurice Hyde and Steve Dietz to the nominating committee.  The nominating committee held one meeting to nominate candidates for the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Each member of the nominating committee attended at least 75% of the nominating committee meetings.  
The nominating committee oversees the identification and evaluation of individuals qualified to become directors and nominates the director nominees for each annual meeting of the members. The major responsibilities of the nominating committee are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Identify, recruit and evaluate candidates for open director positions on the Board, including incumbent directors; 
• Make recommendations to the Board concerning the composition of the Board, including its size and qualifications for membership; 
• Develop a nomination process for director candidates; 
• Annually nominate candidates to run for election or re-election to the Board; and 
• Present to the Board, as necessary, candidates to fill vacancies on the Board. 
[END TABLE]
The following list represents the types of criteria the nominating committee takes into account when identifying and evaluating potential nominees:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Agricultural, business, legal, technical/engineering, accounting and financial background and experience; 
• Community or civic involvement; 
• Independence from the Company (i.e. free from family, material business or professional relationships with the Company); 
• Lack of potential conflicts of interest with the Company; 
• A candidate's reputation for integrity, good judgment, commitment and willingness to consider matters with objectivity and impartiality; and 
• Specific needs of the Board relative to any particular candidate so that the overall composition of the Board reflects a mix of talents, experience, expertise and perspectives appropriate to the Company's circumstances. 
[END TABLE]
The nominating committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board in March 2013.  A copy of the nominating committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.homelandenergysolutions.com.  The nominating committee does  not have a policy for receiving nominations for director positions from the Company's members.  The Company believes this is reasonable because the Operating Agreement provides a procedure for the members to nominate individuals to stand for election as directors.  The nominating committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  Each member of the nominating committee is independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.  The nominating committee does not have a formal policy regarding consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, however, any member may nominate a director nominee pursuant to the procedures described below.   
The Board and nominating committee personally solicited nominations for individuals to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting and notified the members that the nominating committee was accepting applications in the Company's newsletter.  The Company, through the nominating committee, received the names of four potential nominees from the members and the nominating committee nominated three of these potential nominees to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
Member Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting
Nominations for Director Positions
Notice of member nominations for the election of directors for the 2020 annual meeting must be submitted in writing to the Company by October 25, 2019, either by personal delivery or by United States Mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Company.  The Company suggests that nominations for the 2020 annual meeting of the members be submitted by certified mail-return receipt requested.  
The notice of member nominations must contain: (i) the name and address of the member who intends to make the nomination; (ii) a representation that the member is a holder of units of the Company entitled to vote at the annual meeting and intends to appear personally or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation or employment of each nominee; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the member and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the member; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by the member as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; (vi) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected; and (vii) a nominating petition signed and dated by the holders of at least five percent (5%) of the then outstanding units and clearly setting forth the proposed nominee as a candidate of the director's seat to be filled at the next election of directors.  If a presiding officer at a meeting of the members determines that a nomination is not made in accordance with this procedure, the officer must declare that the nomination was defective and therefore must be disregarded.  In addition, the Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information that may be reasonably required to determine the eligibility of such nominee to serve as a director of the Company.  
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
We engaged in the following transactions with related parties during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018:
Art's Milling Service
Randy Bruess is the General Manager of Art's Milling Service, Inc. from which the Company purchases corn.  The Company purchased approximately $3,641,000 worth of corn from Art's Milling Service, Inc. during our 2018 fiscal year.  Mr. Bruess serves on the Board.  The Company could not determine the amount of Mr. Bruess' individual interest in the transactions listed above without unreasonable expense. The Company believes that these purchases from Art's Milling Service, Inc. were on terms no less favorable than the Company could have received from independent third parties.
Related Party Transaction Review Policies and Procedures
The Board reviews and/or ratifies all transactions with related parties, as that term is defined by Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K, or any transaction in which related persons have an indirect interest.  The Operating Agreement includes a written policy that requires that any such related transaction be made on terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the Company than if the transaction had been made with an independent third party.  Further, the Operating Agreement requires our directors to disclose any potential financial interest in any transaction being considered by the Board.  The Company is not aware of any related party transactions that were approved during the Company's 2018 fiscal year which did not comply with this policy. Family Relationships
No family relationships currently exist between any of the directors, nominees, officers, or key employees of the Company. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
In December 2015, the Company appointed James Broghammer as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Broghammer's engagement is set forth in an agreement dated December 1, 2015 which was amended and restated on September 29, 2016 and again on February 6, 2019.  For a period of time during our 2017 fiscal year, Christine Marchand served as our Interim Chief Financial Officer until a replacement was hired.  During our 2018 fiscal year, the following individuals were part of our management team: Beth Eiler served as our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Howes served as our Chief Operating Officer, Stan Wubbena served as our Commodity Manager/Vice-President and Katherine Balk served as our VP of Human Resources.  Throughout this proxy statement, James Broghammer, Beth Eiler, Kevin Howes, Stan Wubbena and Katherine Balk are referred to as the "executive officers."  As discussed below, the Board sets the compensation paid to the executive officers.
Executive Compensation Committee
In April 2010, we established an executive compensation committee.  Mathew Driscoll (Chair), Steven Core and Leslie Hansen currently serve on our executive compensation committee.  Each member of the executive compensation committee is independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.  The compensation committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board in March 2013.  A copy of the executive compensation committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.homelandenergysolutions.com.  The compensation committee participates in benchmarking surveys and uses this information to establish compensation for the Company's employees, including the executive officers.  During our 2018 fiscal year, the executive compensation committee held one meeting, and each member of the committee attended at least 75% of the meetings.
The executive compensation committee considers compensation paid to the Company's employees, including the Company's executive officers.  The executive compensation committee has responsibility for establishing, implementing and regularly monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives and considering whether the compensation paid by the Company is competitive.  The executive compensation committee is responsible for exploring compensation arrangements for our executive officers, including determining whether compensation paid to our executive officers is competitive with other companies in our industry.  The executive compensation committee of the Board has responsibility for establishing, implementing and regularly monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives.   
The executive compensation committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) establishes and administers a compensation policy for the executive officers; 
(2) reviews and approves the compensation policy for all of our employees other than executive officers; 
(3) reviews and monitors our financial performance as it affects our compensation policies or the administration of those policies; 
(4) reviews and monitors our succession plans; 
(5) approves awards to employees pursuant to our incentive compensation plans; and 
(6) approves modifications in the employee benefit plans with respect to the benefits salaried employees receive under such plans. 
[END TABLE]
All of the committee's actions are reported to the Board and, where appropriate, submitted to the Board for ratification.  From time to time, the compensation committee may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to implement certain decisions of the committee, to set compensation for lower executive officers, including the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Commodity Manager/Vice-President and VP Human Resources, or to fulfill administrative duties.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Our compensation programs are designed to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and talented executives who will contribute to the Company's success by reason of their ability, ingenuity and industry; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Link compensation realized to the achievement of the Company's short and long-term financial and strategic goals; 
• Align management and member interests by encouraging long-term member value creation; 
• Maximize the financial efficiency of the compensation program from tax, accounting, cash flow and dilution perspectives; and 
• Support important corporate governance principles and comply with best practices. 
[END TABLE]
To achieve these objectives, the executive compensation committee expects to implement and maintain compensation plans that tie a portion of the executives' overall compensation to the Company's financial performance. 
Cornerstone Resources, LLC Agreement
Effective December 1, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Cornerstone Resources, LLC pursuant to which Cornerstone Resources, LLC agreed to provide James Broghammer to serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer for the Company.

Executive Compensation
During our 2018 fiscal year, our executive compensation committee reviewed the compensation paid to the Company's management employees.  We expect our executive compensation committee to perform this evaluation approximately annually.  The performance of each management employee whose compensation is set by the Board was discussed by the Board.  The Board received input and salary recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer regarding the management employees that report to him.  In addition, the Board received input and salary recommendations from our Chief Operating Officer regarding the performance of the management employees that report to him.  The executive compensation committee took into account the members' approval of the Say-on-Pay vote at its 2018 annual meeting.  Following these reports and recommendations, the Board approved the salaries of the Company's management employees.  
Compensation Components
Base Salary
Base salaries for the executive officers which are employed by the Company are established based on the scope of their roles, responsibilities, experience levels and performance, and taking into account competitive market compensation paid by comparable companies for similar positions.  Base salaries are reviewed approximately annually, and may be adjusted from time to time to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual performance and experience.

Certain members of the Company's management team, including the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Beth Eiler, Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Howes, our VP of Human Resources, Katherine Balk and Commodity Manager/Vice-President, Stan Wubbena, (the "Management Team") participate in our Executive Compensation Plan.  Our Chief Executive Officer, James Broghammer, receives a bonus based on his contract with the Company which is calculated based on the net income of the Company and is subject to a cap equal to the total amount of compensation paid for the year for Mr. Broghammer's services.  The Company adopted a new executive compensation plan effective as of January 1, 2016 (the "Executive Compensation Plan").  The Executive Compensation Plan provides for an annual bonus to be paid to the Management Team based on the Company's net income and subject to certain reductions based on contingencies in the Executive Compensation Plan. 
Net Income Bonus
Executive Compensation Plan
Pursuant to the Executive Compensation Plan, the Company paid to the Management Team an annual bonus equal to 1% of the Company's net income for the 2018 fiscal year.  Each participant's portion of the bonus was determined by the participant's  base salary compared to the base salaries of the other participants.  This award is subject to a cap of 75% of the participant's base salary.  The net income bonus was subject to reductions based on the Executive Compensation Plan, including as a result of violations of the Company's employee handbook, whether the non-management employees earned a bonus for the year and individual performance by the Management Team members. The net income bonus under the Executive Compensation Plan is paid shortly after the end of each fiscal year.  For any employee who was employed for less than three years, a bonus award is subject to vesting.  For employees subject to vesting, 50% of the award is paid shortly after the end of the year when the bonus is awarded, 25% is paid the next year and 25% is paid two years after the bonus is awarded.  Beth Eiler, our CFO is the only member of the Management Team whose bonus is subject to vesting.
Members of the Management Team may elect to defer all or any portion of the net income bonus in any year.  If a member of the Management Team elects to defer payment of any portion of the net income bonus, such deferral shall be for five years.  Members of the Management Team may re-defer payment of the net income bonus after the initial deferral period has expired.  
For our 2018 fiscal year, the net income bonus was paid to our Chief Financial Officer, Beth Eiler, Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Howes, VP of Human Resources, Katherine Balk and Commodity Manager/Vice-President, Stan Wubbena.  The Company believes that the net income bonus is reasonable as it ties the bonus paid to these management employees and executive officers to the financial success of the Company and is easily quantified by the Company.
The Company paid an annual net income bonus for its 2018 fiscal year of  $200,259.  The Company paid an annual bonus for its 2017 fiscal year of $170,579.  The Company paid an annual bonus for its 2016 fiscal year of $346,392. 
Benefits and Perquisites
We do not provide any material executive perquisites.  We have no supplemental retirement plans or pension plans and we have no intentions of implementing any such plans in our 2018 fiscal year. Stan Wubbena, our Commodities Manager/Vice-President is provided a truck by the Company, the use of which is valued at $3,900 per year.
No Pension Benefit Plan
We offer no pension benefit plans to our executive officers.  
Change in Control Agreements
On February 25, 2013, the Company executed Change in Control Agreements (the "Agreements") with two current members of its senior management team, Stan Wubbena and Kevin Howes.  On December 3, 2018, the Company executed Change in Control Agreements with Beth Eiler and Katherine Balk.  The Agreements provide for the payment of two years' salary and provision of other benefits to these members of the Company's senior management team in the event they are dismissed without cause after the Company experiences a material change in the Company's ownership or management as defined by the Agreements. The purpose of the Agreements is to provide an incentive for these members of our senior management team to maintain their employment with the Company and preserve management continuity in the event the Company experiences a change in control. If the Company does not experience a change in control or if these senior managers maintain their employment with the Company after a change in control, no payments will be made pursuant to the Agreements. 
Accounting and Tax Treatment of Awards
None of our executive officers, directors, or employees receives compensation in excess of $1,000,000 and therefore the entire amount of their compensation is deductible by the Company as a business expense. Certain large executive compensation awards are not tax deductible by companies making such awards. None of our compensation arrangements are likely to reach this cap in the foreseeable future.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of the executive compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of the Company.  There are no interlocking relationships between the Company and other entities that might affect the determination of the compensation of our executive officers.  Executive Compensation Committee Report
The executive compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.  Based upon this review and discussion, the executive compensation committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

CEO Pay Ratio
As a result of rules adopted by the SEC, we are disclosing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018:
• The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) was $73,903.
• The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, as reported on our Summary Compensation Table, was $179,077.
• Based on this information, the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to our median employee was 2.43:1.00.
Our employee population as of December 31, 2018 (the date we selected to identify our median employee), consisted of 58 individuals, with all of these individuals located in the United States. We identified our median employee based on the annual total compensation paid during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. In addition, for purposes of reporting the ratio of annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee, both the Chief Executive Officer and median employee's total compensation paid during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, were calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. The Company has not made any of the adjustments permissible by the SEC, nor have any material assumptions or estimates been made to identify the median employee or to determine annual total compensation.
