SUMMARY 
IDEX Corporation (the Company or IDEX) has prepared this proxy statement (Proxy Statement) in connection with the solicitation by the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) of proxies for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Friday, May 10, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time, at the DoubleTree Hotel, 5460 N. River Road, Rosemont, Illinois 60018 (the Annual Meeting). The Company commenced distribution of, or otherwise made available, this Proxy Statement and the accompanying materials on March 22, 2019. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
You are entitled to vote if you owned shares of IDEX's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Common Stock) as of the close of business on March 15, 2019, the record date of the Annual Meeting. On the record date, a total of 75,793,975 shares of Common Stock were outstanding. Each share of Common Stock entitles its holder of record to one vote on each matter upon which votes are taken at the Annual Meeting. There is no cumulative voting. No other securities are entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote? 
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we encourage you to vote as soon as possible, using one of the methods listed below.

[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" (that is, they are held in the name of a broker, financial institution or other nominee), you will receive instructions with your materials that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. Please review your voting instruction form to determine whether you will be able to vote by telephone or over the Internet.  What is a quorum for the Annual Meeting? 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to take action at the Annual Meeting. A majority of outstanding shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum. The Company will appoint election inspectors to determine whether or not a quorum is present, and to tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person. Under certain circumstances, a broker or other nominee may have discretionary authority to vote shares of Common Stock if instructions have not been received from the beneficial owner or other person entitled to vote. 
The election inspectors will treat directions to withhold authority, abstentions and broker non-votes (which occur when a broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because such broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner) as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. 
What are the voting requirements? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Election of Directors   "Plurality Plus" Standard   No effect   No effect 
 Advisory Vote on  Executive Compensation   The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter   No effect   "Against" 
 Advisory Vote on  Executive Compensation   The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter   No effect   "Against" 
[END TABLE]
What is the "Plurality Plus" Standard? 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for a Plurality Plus Standard with respect to the election of directors. Any nominee who receives a greater number of withhold votes than affirmative votes in an uncontested election is required to submit an offer of resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board within 90 days from the date of election. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must then consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to the offer of resignation.  How does the Board recommend that I vote? 
The Board recommends that you vote: 
1. FOR the election of the Company's nominees as directors. 
2. FOR the approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
3. FOR the ratification of the appointment of auditors. 
What happens if I do not specify a choice for a matter when returning my proxy card? 
If you sign and return your proxy card but do not give voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board, and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to any other business which may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares? 
You can revoke a proxy prior to the completion of voting at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Mailing a new proxy card with a later date.  
2.  Casting a new vote on the Internet or by telephone.  
3.  Sending a written notice of revocation addressed to Denise R. Cade, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and  Corporate Secretary, IDEX Corporation, 1925 West Field Court, Suite 200, Lake Forest, Illinois 60045.  
4.  Voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name," please contact your broker, financial institution or other nominee and comply with such nominee's procedures if you want to change or revoke your previous voting instructions. 
Who will solicit the proxies and who will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
The Company will bear the costs of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement and other costs of the proxy solicitation made by the Board. Certain of the Company's officers and employees may solicit the submission of proxies authorizing the voting of shares in accordance with the Board's recommendations, but no additional remuneration will be paid by the Company for the solicitation of those proxies. Any such solicitations may be made by personal interview, telephone, email or facsimile transmission. 
The Company has made arrangements with brokerage firms and other record holders of its Common Stock to forward proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of such Common Stock. The Company will reimburse those brokerage firms and others for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this work. 
In addition, the Company has engaged Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, Connecticut, to assist in proxy solicitation and collection at a cost of $6,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses.  Why did I receive a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" but no proxy materials? 
As permitted under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making our proxy materials available to stockholders electronically via the Internet. We believe electronic delivery expedites receipt of our proxy materials by stockholders, while lowering the costs and reducing the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. 
If you receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail unless you specifically request them. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability will provide instructions as to how you may review the proxy materials and submit your voting instructions over the Internet. 
If you receive the Notice of Internet Availability by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions in the notice for requesting a printed copy. In addition, the proxy card contains instructions for electing to receive proxy materials over the Internet or by mail in future years.  PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED ON AT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING

Framework for Corporate Governance 
The Board of Directors has the ultimate authority for the management of the Company's business. The Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of the Board committees, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and the Standards for Director Independence (Governance Documents) provide the framework for the governance of the Company. Copies of the current Governance Documents are available under the Investors link on the Company's website at www.idexcorp.com. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines address matters such as election of directors, size and retirement age for the Board, Board composition and membership criteria, the role and responsibilities of the Board and each of its committees, Board evaluations and the frequency of Board meetings (including meetings to be held without the presence of management). 
The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth the guiding principles of business ethics and certain legal requirements applicable to all of the Company's employees and directors. 
Director Independence 
The Board has adopted standards for determining whether a director is independent. These standards are based upon the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and applicable laws and regulations, and are available on the Company's website as described above. The Board also reviewed commercial relationships between the Company and organizations with which directors were affiliated by service as an executive officer. The relationships with these organizations involved the Company's sale or purchase of products or services in the ordinary course of business that were made on arm's-length terms and other circumstances that did not affect the relevant directors' independence under applicable law and NYSE listing standards. 
The Board has affirmatively determined, based on these standards and after considering the relationships described immediately above, that the following directors are independent: Messrs. Beck, Buthman, Cook, Mrozek, Parry and Satterthwaite, and Mss. Helmkamp and Warner. The Board has also determined that Mr. Silvernail is not independent because he is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. All standing Board committees are, and throughout fiscal year 2018 were, composed entirely of independent directors. 
Director Nominations 
The Board believes that maintaining a diverse membership with varying backgrounds, skills, expertise and other differentiating personal characteristics promotes inclusiveness, enhances the Board's deliberations and enables the Board to better represent all of the Company's constituents. Accordingly, the Board is committed to seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences as part of each Board search the Company conducts. The Board considers the following in selecting nominees for the Board: 
Experience (in one or more of the following):  Personal attributes and characteristics: 
Qualified candidates for membership on the Board shall not be discriminated against with regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation or disability. In the past, the Company has engaged executive search firms to help identify and facilitate the screening and interviewing of director candidates. Any search firm retained by the Company to find director candidates is instructed to take into account all of the considerations used by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including diversity. After conducting an initial evaluation of a candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will interview that candidate if it believes the candidate is suitable to be a director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also ask the candidate to meet with other members of the Board. 
If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes a candidate would be a valuable addition to the Board, it will recommend to the full Board appointment or election of that candidate. Annually, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the qualifications and backgrounds of the directors, as well as the overall composition of the Board, and recommends to the full Board the slate of directors for nomination for election at the annual meeting of stockholders. 
Board Leadership 
The Company's Bylaws permit the Board to select its Chairman in the manner it determines to be most appropriate. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, if the Chairman of the Board is not the Chief Executive Officer, and is an independent director, there shall be no Lead Director. If the Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer or is not an independent director, the independent directors shall elect an independent Lead Director. 
William M. Cook has served as Lead Director since immediately following the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The responsibilities of the Lead Director include: 
The independent non-management directors of the Board meet separately as a group at every regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Lead   Director generally presides at these non-management executive sessions. During 2018, the Board held seven meetings. 
The Board believes that its current leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement while deriving the benefit of having the Chief Executive Officer also serve as Chairman of the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer, as the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company's day-to-day operations, is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings and to oversee discussion on business and strategic issues. Coupled with the existence of a Lead Director and regular executive sessions of the non-management directors, this structure provides independent oversight, including risk oversight, while facilitating the exercise of the Board's responsibilities. 
During 2018, each director attended more than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of committees of the Board of which he or she was a member. The Company encourages its directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders but has no formal policy with respect to that attendance. All of the current directors, with the exception of Mr. Parry, attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees an annual assessment of enterprise risk exposure, and the management of such risk, conducted by the Company's executives. 
When assessing enterprise risk, the Board focuses on the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term performance and enhance stockholder value. Direct oversight allows the Board to assess management's inclination for risk, to determine what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company and to discuss with management the means by which to control risk. 
Board and Committee Assessment Process 
On an annual basis, the Board and each Committee conduct assessments, which consist of written self-assessment questionnaires, supplemented by individual interviews of each director conducted by the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The results of the assessment process are then reviewed and discussed by the Board and each Committee and have led to process and oversight improvements. 
Board's Engagement with Management 
The Board approves the Company's executive officers, delegates responsibilities for the conduct of the Company's operations to those officers, and monitors their performance. In addition, members of the Board informally mentor executive officers, meeting with such officers individually to share insights and experiences accumulated over the course of the directors' careers. 
Each year, some directors visit Company manufacturing facilities and meet with their leaders, and some directors attend the Company's annual global leadership conference of about 150 leaders. In addition, each year the Board holds at least one meeting at a Company manufacturing facility where all directors attend a daily management meeting, receive a tour of the facility and participate in an operational review with senior leadership. 
Board's Role in Talent Development and Strategic Planning 
Our Board calendar includes at least one meeting per year at which the Board participates in an extensive review of the Company's talent management and retention strategies, leadership development pipeline and succession plans for senior management. 
Each fall the Board participates in a multi-day three-year enterprise strategy review with the Company's executive officers and other senior management. Management and the Board agree   upon a strategy and it is used as a lens for decision making at each Board meeting following the annual comprehensive review. As a result, strategy discussions are a regular feature of Board meetings throughout the year. 
Director Onboarding and Education 
All new directors participate in our director onboarding program. The onboarding process includes in-person meetings at the Company's headquarters with senior leaders to familiarize new directors with the Company's strategic vision, values and culture; operational and financial reporting structure; and legal, compliance and governance framework. In addition, new directors have also attended training courses led by IDEX senior leaders covering the 80/20 business process that serves as the foundation of IDEX's operating model and seeks to accelerate profitable growth by focusing resources on our highest value opportunities. 
The Board encourages all directors to participate in continuing director education programs, either individually or together with other Committee members, and directors are reimbursed for their expenses for such programs. Over the past eighteen months, directors attended off-site education seminars covering a variety of topics, including board and audit committee leadership, strategy, regulatory developments, diversity and inclusion, social media, emerging technologies and cybersecurity. In addition, last fall all directors participated in an educational session led by an outside expert on environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics, which was delivered as part of a regularly-scheduled Board meeting. 
Investor Outreach 
We value the input of our stockholders and believe that it is important to understand their questions and concerns about the Company. During 2018, we met with a number of our stockholders and prospective stockholders to answer questions about the Company and learn about matters that are important to them. We plan to continue our investor outreach efforts during 2019. 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
As an embodiment of our commitment to focus on what matters to our various stakeholders, in the summer of 2018, we partnered with a third-party facilitator to conduct a materiality assessment to help us identify and prioritize those ESG topics that are most impactful to IDEX and our stakeholders. These efforts are consistent with our mission to improve the lives of the more than 7,000 people who are part of the IDEX family, the communities in which we live and work, as well our investors, customers and users of our products. We utilized the results from the materiality assessment to inform our first Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which was published in March 2019 and is available under the Corporate Social Responsibility link on our website at www.idexcorp.com. 
Communications with Our Board 
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact the Board and the directors by writing to Denise R. Cade, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, IDEX Corporation, 1925 West Field Court, Suite 200, Lake Forest, Illinois 60045. Inquiries sent by mail will be reviewed, sorted and summarized by Ms. Cade before they are forwarded to any director. 
BOARD COMMITTEES 
Important functions of the Board are performed by committees comprised of members of the Board. There are three standing committees of the Board: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each committee has a written charter that is available on the Company's website as described above. 
Subject to applicable provisions of the Company's Bylaws and based on the   recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board as a whole appoints the members of each committee each year at its first meeting. The Board may, at any time, appoint or remove committee members or change the authority or responsibility delegated to any committee, subject to applicable law and NYSE listing standards. 
The following table summarizes the current membership of the committees of the Board.

While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk management and exposure, and legal compliance. The Audit Committee receives an annual risk assessment report from the Company's internal auditors and reviews and discusses the Company's financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor, control and report those exposures. 
During 2018, Messrs. Beck, Buthman, Cook and Mrozek served as members of the Audit Committee, and the Board determined that each of them is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by SEC rules. Mr. Mrozek served as Chair of the Audit Committee during 2018 and through the filing of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 in February 2019, after which Mr. Buthman was elected as Chair, effective as of March 2, 2019. 
The Audit Committee has adopted a written Related Person Transactions Policy regarding the review, approval or ratification of transactions with related persons. All related person transactions are approved by the Audit Committee. If the transaction involves a related person who is an Audit Committee member or immediate family member of an Audit Committee member, that Audit Committee   member will not be included in the deliberations or vote regarding approval. In approving the transaction, the Audit Committee must determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company. At the first Audit Committee meeting of each calendar year, or a subsequent meeting if the Audit Committee so chooses, the Audit Committee reviews any previously approved or ratified related person transactions that remain ongoing and have a remaining term of more than six months or remaining amounts payable to or receivable from the Company of more than $10,000. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, taking into consideration the Company's contractual obligations, the Audit Committee determines if it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue, modify or terminate any such related person transactions. 
During 2018, the Audit Committee held eight meetings. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee's primary purpose and responsibilities are to: 
To assist the Compensation Committee in discharging its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (F.W. Cook) to act as an outside consultant. F.W. Cook is engaged by, and reports directly to, the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed the nature of the relationship between itself and F.W. Cook, including all personal and business relationships between the committee members, F.W. Cook and the individual compensation consultants who provide advice to the Compensation Committee. Based on its review, the Compensation Committee did not identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest in F.W. Cook's engagement as an independent consultant. 
F.W. Cook works with the Compensation Committee and management to structure the Company's compensation programs and to evaluate the competitiveness of its executive compensation levels. F.W. Cook's primary areas of assistance to the Compensation Committee are:  F.W. Cook periodically provides the Compensation Committee and management market data on a variety of compensation-related topics. The Compensation Committee has authorized F.W. Cook to interact with the Company's management, as needed, on behalf of the Compensation Committee, to obtain or confirm information. 
During 2018, Ms. Helmkamp, Mr. Parry, Mr. Satterthwaite and Ms. Warner served as members of the Compensation Committee. None of these directors (i) was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during 2018, (ii) was formerly an officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. There were no relationships between the Company's executive officers and the members of the Compensation Committee that require disclosure under Item 407(e)(4) of Regulation S-K. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee held four meetings. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's primary purpose and responsibilities are to: 
It is the policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider nominees for the Board recommended by the Company's stockholders in accordance with the procedures described under "STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS" below. Stockholder nominees who are nominated in accordance with these procedures will be given the same consideration as nominees for director from other sources. 
During 2018, Ms. Helmkamp, Mr. Parry, Mr. Satterthwaite and Ms. Warner served as members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
During 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings.  COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
The objectives of our director compensation program are to attract highly-qualified individuals to serve on our Board and to align our directors' interests with the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the program to ensure that it continues to meet these objectives. 
The Company believes that to attract and retain qualified directors, pay levels should be targeted at the 50th percentile (or median) of pay levels for directors at comparable companies. On at least a biennial basis, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of F.W. Cook, evaluates the competitiveness of director compensation. The primary reference point for the determination of market pay is the peer group of companies. The peer group used in this analysis was the same peer group used for the Company's executive compensation analysis. 
For further details on this topic, refer to "Peer Companies" under "Setting Executive Compensation" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis below. Market composite data derived from pay surveys available to F.W. Cook and to the Company is also used. 
Our director compensation for 2018 was as follows:

Initial equity grant values are equal to the annual grant value prorated for the remaining period of time until the next Annual Meeting. Annual equity grants to continuing directors are made on the date of the Annual Meeting. All grants are structured to provide 100% of the expected value in the form of restricted stock unit awards, and are made under the IDEX Corporation Incentive Award Plan (Incentive Award Plan). 
The restricted stock units vest in full on the earliest of the third anniversary of the grant date, retirement, failure of the director to be re-elected to the Board, or a change in control of the Company. The restricted stock units are non-transferable until the recipient is no longer serving as a director, and are subject to forfeiture if the director terminates service as a director for reasons other than death, disability, retirement, or failure to be re-elected to the Board.  Since the start of 2015, directors have had the ability to defer payment of all or a portion of their annual equity grant. 
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the Company's Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, directors are permitted to defer their cash compensation as of the date their compensation would otherwise be payable. In general, directors must make elections to defer fees payable during a calendar year by the end of the preceding calendar year. Newly appointed directors have up to 30 days from their appointment to elect to defer future fees. 
All amounts deferred are recorded in a memorandum account for each director and are credited or debited with earnings or losses as if such amounts had been invested in an interest- bearing account or certain mutual funds, at the option of the director. The deferred compensation credited to the interest-bearing account is adjusted on at least a quarterly basis with hypothetical earnings equal to the lesser of the Barclays Capital Long Term Bond AAA — Corporate Bond Index as of the first business day in November of the calendar year preceding the year for which the earnings are to be credited or 120% of the long-term applicable federal rate as of the first business day in November. 
In accordance with SEC rules, no earnings on deferred compensation are shown in the Director Compensation table below because no "above market" rates were earned on deferred amounts in 2018. Directors must elect irrevocably to receive the deferred funds either in a lump sum or in equal annual installments of up to 10 years, and to begin receiving distributions either at termination of Board service or at a future specified date. 
If a director should die before all amounts credited under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan have been paid, the unpaid balance in the participating director's account will be paid to the director's beneficiary. The memorandum accounts are not funded, and the right to receive future payments of amounts recorded in these accounts is an unsecured claim against the Company's general assets. 
Stock Ownership Guideline 
Under the Director Compensation Policy, non-management directors are subject to a stock ownership guideline. Non-management directors are required to maintain direct ownership of shares of Common Stock equal to or greater in value to five times the current annual Board service retainer. No non-management director is permitted to sell shares of Common Stock until the director satisfies the stock ownership guideline, and after a director meets the stock ownership guideline, the director may not sell shares if the sale would put the director below the stock ownership guideline. 
As of March 15, 2019, all non-management directors were in compliance with the stock ownership guideline or the mandatory holding requirement until the ownership guideline is met.  2018 Director Compensation 
The following table summarizes the total compensation earned in 2018 for the Company's non-management directors. Mr. Silvernail receives no additional compensation for his service as a director.

Except as indicated by the notes to the following table, the holders listed below have sole voting power and investment power over the shares beneficially held by them. Under SEC rules, the number of shares shown as beneficially owned includes shares of Common Stock subject to options that are exercisable currently or will be exercisable within 60 days of March 15, 2019. Shares of Common Stock subject to options that are exercisable within 60 days of March 15, 2019, are considered to be outstanding for the purpose of determining the percentage of shares held by a holder, but not for the purpose of computing the percentage held by others. An * indicates ownership of less than one percent of the outstanding Common Stock.

Key Takeaways of our 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
For 2018, our executive compensation programs were designed to directly link compensation opportunities to the financial performance metrics that we believe are the best measures of success in our business: EPS, cash flow conversion, organic sales growth and relative TSR. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 bonus payouts were 164% of target, which reflect record performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our TSR for the 2016-2018 period was 76%, which resulted in an 83rd percentile performance compared to the  companies in the Russell Midcap Index and resulted in a 250% payout of performance stock units (PSUs).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 long-term incentive awards were granted at values greater than the 2017 awards, reflecting financial and  operational outperformance against peers and prior-year goals, including historically strong stock price performance. This resulted in a 2018 long-term incentive grant value for Mr. Silvernail that was 19% greater than his 2017 grant. See  "2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards" under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — 2018 Executive Compensation Program" for further details.  
[END TABLE]
NEO Compensation Aligns with Company Performance 
The compensation opportunities of our executives are directly tied to the performance of the Company. Our pay-for-performance philosophy is demonstrated by the following elements of our executive compensation program for 2018: 
Approximately 83% of our CEO's 2018 total targeted pay was performance-based, and an average of approximately 71% of our other NEOs' total targeted pay in 2018 was performance-based. The charts   below show the allocation of 2018 targeted pay across base salary, the annual cash incentive award, and the long-term incentive award for our CEO and other NEOs. 
In 2018, our long-term incentives continued to represent the single largest component of our CEO's and other NEOs' targeted pay, representing approximately 63% and 50% of total targeted pay, respectively. 
Maintaining a balanced perspective is a core part of the Company's business strategy, which requires employees to take calculated risks to capitalize on anticipated changes in the Company's numerous businesses. The Compensation Committee believes that balancing the proportion of cash and non-cash awards, as well as short-term versus long-term awards, is important to motivate performance while mitigating risk. Cash-based awards are important in motivating executives for the short-term, while long-term incentives focus executives who have the greatest ability to impact business results on managing the business for the long-term, and reinforce the link between their earnings opportunity and the long-term growth of the Company. 
Our 2018 incentive awards are directly tied to performance metrics that balance absolute and relative performance goals: EPS, cash flow conversion, organic sales growth and TSR (measured on a relative basis). We believe these are the best measures of our financial success and support the creation of stockholder value. 
Role of Say-on-Pay 
The Company held an advisory vote on executive compensation (say-on-pay) at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The say-on-pay advisory vote received support from over 98% of the shares voted at the 2018 Annual Meeting. The Compensation Committee believes this affirms stockholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not make any material changes to the underlying structure of our executive compensation program for fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee will continue to review and consider the outcome of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the NEOs.  2018 Executive Compensation Program 
The following discussion describes our 2018 compensation elements and 2018 compensation decisions related to our NEOs. 
2018 Key Compensation Elements 
The material elements of 2018 compensation for the NEOs are outlined below: 
Base Salary 
Base salaries are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect market data, as well as individual responsibility, experience and performance. The table below highlights the change in 2018 base salary for each NEO, reflecting one or more of the following: annual merit increase, market and performance-related adjustments.

[END TABLE]
 Short-Term Incentives 
The Company administers the short-term incentive plan under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (MICP). The amount of the annual cash bonus paid to each participant is determined under the following formula: 
Annual Bonus = Base Salary x Individual Target Bonus Percentage x Business Performance Factor 
Individual Target Bonus Percentage for the year is a percentage of the participant's base salary and is based on the participant's position and market data. The Business Performance Factor (discussed in more detail below) is calculated based on measurable corporate quantitative objectives, which are given a combined 70% weighting, and one strategic measure with a 30% weighting. 
For 2018, the measurable quantitative objectives within the Business Performance Factor were adjusted EPS and adjusted cash flow conversion. Adjusted EPS excludes from reported earnings per share the impact of acquisition and divestiture-related income and charges, and restructuring charges (EPS Adjustments). Adjusted cash flow conversion is cash flow as a percent of net income excluding the impact of the EPS Adjustments. The payout of each quantitative objective is a function of the amount by which actual performance exceeds or falls short of goal, with a maximum payout of 200% of target for each objective. 
For 2018, the 30% strategic measure was organic sales growth. Organic sales growth is a critical business metric and helps identify the underlying health of the Company's businesses and management's ability to increase sales through innovation and customer focus. Organic sales is defined as net sales of the Company adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and sales from acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership. The goal for organic sales growth is established relative to expected growth in key markets, such as industrial, health and science instrumentation, energy and fire and rescue. 
For 2018, the relative weightings and the performance against the quantitative and strategic measures resulted in a recommended Business Performance Factor of 164%, as shown in the table below.

[END TABLE]
Prior to 2018, the Company also provided short-term incentive payments under the Incentive Award Plan (IAP) to allow performance-based bonuses to certain executives to be fully deductible under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m). The Tax Cut and Jobs Act eliminated the deductibility of excess qualified performance-based compensation under IRC Section 162(m). The MICP, under which the 2018 short-term incentives were administered, is the plan that governs annual incentives for the broader executive population and also the plan under which the CFO received short-term incentive awards prior to 2018 and final awards are calculated the same as those under the IAP. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Long-term incentive awards are generally made on an annual basis, or at the time of a special event (such as upon hiring or promotion). We typically grant awards on the date of the first 
Board meeting of a year, or the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. We attempt to make awards during periods when we do not have non-public information that could impact our stock price. Working with its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee granted long-term incentive awards to the NEOs in early 2018. Other than the CEO, each NEO has a long-term incentive target stated as a percentage of base salary. The long-term incentive targets are established on an individual basis taking into consideration market practice for each role, and individual impact and performance. 
In 2018, the NEOs received annual long-term incentive awards consisting of PSUs and stock options, which are intended to emphasize the link between pay and performance. The target number of PSUs granted was determined by dividing the 
 PSU award value by the closing price of Common Stock on the date of grant. The number of stock options granted was determined by dividing the stock option award value by the grant date fair value, utilizing the Binomial lattice option-pricing model. For additional details of the assumptions made in the valuation of such awards, see note 14 "Share-Based Compensation" of the financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Compensation Committee may grant awards above or below target based on individual and Company performance. In 2018, the Committee reviewed the Company's performance compared to one- and three-year TSR, revenue and EPS growth of companies in the executive pay peer group (listed below), as well as performance against strategic goals established at the beginning of the year. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee determined to grant above-target long-term incentive award values to the NEOs for 2018 due to the Company's strong performance. The Compensation Committee intends to perform a   similar review annually and may adjust annual long-term incentives above or below target levels as appropriate to support the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy. 
2018 CEO Awards. For 2018, the Board granted Mr. Silvernail an award at a value that was greater than his 2017 award based on the same analysis. The grant value was determined based on the Compensation Committee's recommendation, which considered Mr. Silvernail's compensation position relative to the market, his outstanding performance in leading the Company, and the Company's strong performance during the prior three-year period. The following chart shows the grant value recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board, and the Summary Compensation Table reported value of Mr. Silvernail's long-term incentive awards for 2017 and 2018. The Summary Compensation Table reported value reflects the grant date fair value determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Similar to the other NEOs, the Compensation Committee and the Board will consider similar criteria in assessing future awards for Mr. Silvernail to determine whether an upward or downward adjustment is warranted.

[END TABLE]
Objectives of Long-Term Incentive Vehicles 
The Compensation Committee believes that PSUs and stock options both motivate management actions that drive the creation of stockholder value and promote executive stock ownership. However, each long-term incentive component has different characteristics. The value of the PSUs after the three-year performance period is directly linked to relative TSR, as described above, as well as the stock price movement during the performance period. Stock options provide value only to the extent that the Company's stock price appreciates above the stock price on the date of grant. 
PSU Design Features 
The PSUs have a three-year performance period and measure the Company's relative TSR against the TSR of companies in the Russell Midcap Index at the end of such period. If the Company achieves 50th percentile TSR performance as compared to the group of companies, each NEO will receive the target number of performance units, paid out in shares of Common Stock. Threshold performance is at the 33rd percentile, which will result in a payout equal to 33% of target; performance below this level will result in zero payout. Maximum payout is 250% of the target number of shares for 80th percentile performance or higher. Payouts are interpolated between the 33rd percentile and 50th percentile and between the 50th percentile and 80th percentile performance. Cumulative dividend equivalent payments will be made at the end of the performance period based on the number of shares of Common Stock received by each executive. 
In selecting relative TSR as the measure, the Compensation Committee noted that TSR is highly correlated with a combination of other metrics that are important to the Company and to investors, notably: return on invested capital, operating profit margin and compound annual sales growth rate (CAGR). 
Consistent with 2017, the Compensation Committee selected the Russell Midcap Index companies as the comparator group for relative TSR for the 2018 PSU grant. In selecting the Russell Midcap Index companies, the Compensation Committee's objective was to have a sizeable group of companies similar in revenue and market capitalization to the Company. In addition, the Compensation Committee seeks to align with the mutual funds within the Company's largest stockholders as they generally hold a broad range of investments covering multiple industries. 
Our PSU grant for the 2016-2018 performance period resulted in a 250% payout based on a   76% TSR, which placed the Company in the 83rd percentile of companies in the Russell Midcap Index. 
Setting Executive Compensation 
Role of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee establishes the Company's compensation philosophy, structures the Company's compensation programs to be consistent with that philosophy, and approves each element of NEO compensation. In the case of the CEO, the Board reviews, ratifies and approves compensation recommendations made by the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee performs periodic reviews of executive pay tally sheets. The tally sheets outline each executive's recent annual target and actual pay history, unvested equity holdings and termination payments under various scenarios. Data from the tally sheets is considered by the Compensation Committee when setting target total compensation. Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews and adjusts target total compensation levels annually. Actual total compensation may vary from target based on performance and changes in stock price over time. 
Generally, the amount of compensation realized historically, or potentially realizable in the future, from past equity awards does not directly impact the level at which future pay opportunities are set. When granting equity awards, the Compensation Committee considers market data and Company and individual performance. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and replace, as necessary, compensation consultants to provide it with independent advice. The Compensation Committee has engaged F.W. Cook as its independent consultant to advise it on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. This selection was made without the input or influence of management. 
Under the terms of its agreement with the Compensation Committee, F.W. Cook will not provide any other services to the Company, unless directed to do so by the Compensation Committee. During fiscal year 2018, F.W. Cook provided no services to the Company other than to advise the Compensation Committee on executive and non-employee director compensation issues. In its review, the Compensation Committee did not identify any conflicts of interest raised by the work F.W. Cook performed in fiscal year 2018, nor any business or personal relationships that would impair F.W. Cook's independence. 
Setting Individual Executive Pay 
The Compensation Committee formulates a recommendation of CEO pay based on the financial and operating performance of the Company, the Compensation Committee's assessment of the CEO and a thorough review of the market benchmarking data discussed below. The CEO pay recommendations put forth by the Compensation Committee are then reviewed and subject to approval by the Board. 
The pay packages for the other NEOs are set by the Compensation Committee after taking into consideration the recommendations of the CEO. Individual pay decisions are based on an assessment of the individual executive, utilizing the following criteria:

The Compensation Committee reviews pay data from two primary sources (third party surveys and peer company data) as one input in determining appropriate target compensation levels. The Compensation Committee utilizes the expertise of its independent compensation consultant, F.W. Cook, in developing compensation recommendations for the NEOs, including the CEO. The Compensation Committee believes that to attract and retain qualified management, total direct compensation should be competitively targeted within a range that includes the market median for comparable positions at comparable companies, with market compensation data being only one of many factors considered by the Compensation Committee when setting the compensation levels for any particular executive. While an individual executive's target compensation is positioned within the competitive range based on the individual factors listed above, actual compensation in any given year should and does vary from target based on Company and individual performance. 
The Compensation Committee undertook a review and analysis to ensure that the 2018 executive compensation programs appropriately reflected the market for talent. The Compensation Committee considered relevant market pay practices to ensure the Company's ability to recruit and retain high performing talent across its diversified markets and global footprint. Two surveys and a peer group analysis were utilized for the 2018 executive compensation market analysis for the NEOs. 
Survey Data 
The Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Database Survey and the Equilar Top 25 Survey were used because they include a broad range of manufacturing companies that are comparable to the Company in size, geography and industry.  Peer Companies 
The peer group of companies identified below consists of companies that are similar to the Company in terms of their size (i.e., revenue, and market capitalization), diversified industry profile (ranging from customized manufacturing solutions to emerging markets in highly specialized health science technology), investment in research and development and global presence. In addition, the peer companies have executive officer positions that are comparable to the Company's in terms of breadth, complexity and scope of responsibilities. F.W. Cook reviewed the composition of the peer group used to benchmark pay in 2017 with the Compensation Committee. Based on that review, for 2018 the Compensation Committee removed CLARCOR Inc. because it was acquired by Parker-Hannifin Corporation.

The Compensation Committee believes that multiple data sources provide for a clearer perspective of the market. As such, with the assistance of management and F.W. Cook, the Compensation Committee developed an aggregate composite of the market data to establish target compensation levels for the executives weighted as follows:

Other Compensation Components 
Employee Benefits 
The NEOs participate in group health, welfare and qualified retirement programs available to all of the Company's employees. The NEOs also participate in nonqualified supplemental retirement plans, deferred compensation arrangements and supplemental disability benefits. Participation in these nonqualified plans is intended to provide the NEOs with the   opportunity to accumulate retirement benefits at levels above the limitations imposed by tax qualified plans. For a more complete explanation of these plans, see the "Narrative to 2018 Summary Compensation Table," the "Narrative to Nonqualified Deferred Compensation at 2018 Fiscal Year End Table," and the discussion under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Severance and Change in Control Benefits 
Each of the NEOs is entitled to severance benefits under the terms of written agreements in the event that their employment is actually or constructively terminated without cause. The amount of the benefit, which varies with the individual, depends on whether or not the termination is in connection with a change in control. The level of each NEO's severance benefits reflects the Company's perception of the market for their positions at the time the agreements were put in place. For additional information, see the section below entitled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Perquisites 
The Compensation Committee believes in providing limited perquisites in line with market practice. The NEOs are provided a car allowance. The CEO is entitled to limited use of the Company's leased aircraft for non-business purposes. For further details on these perquisites, see the "Narrative to 2018 Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Other Executive Compensation Matters 
Stock Grant Practices 
For all newly issued stock option awards, the exercise price of the stock option award will be the closing price of Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant. If the grant date for the annual awards falls on a weekend, the exercise price of stock option awards will be the closing price of Common Stock on the NYSE on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. 
Stock Ownership 
Consistent with its executive pay philosophy, the Company requires that executive officers maintain minimum ownership levels of Common Stock as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive              Ownership as a Multiple   of Base Salary     
Executive              Ownership as a Multiple   of Base Salary     
 CEO     5x    
 CFO,  COO     3x    
 Other  NEOs     2x    
[END TABLE]
NEOs must comply with these ownership requirements within five years of their date of hire or promotion. Counted for purposes of satisfying ownership requirements are shares directly owned, unvested restricted shares and PSUs at target. As of December 31, 2018, all NEOs met or exceeded the ownership guidelines. 
Hedging and Pledging 
All directors and officers of the Company are prohibited from (i) pledging Company securities (including through holding Company securities in margin accounts) and (ii) engaging in any transaction in which they may profit from short-term speculative swings in the value of the Company's securities ("hedging"). For this purpose, "hedging" includes "short-sales" (selling borrowed securities that the seller hopes can be purchased at a lower price in the future) or "short sales against the box" (selling, but not delivering, owned securities), "put" and "call" options (publicly available rights to sell or buy securities within a certain period of time at a specified price or the like), and other hedging transactions designed to minimize the risk inherent in owning Common Stock, such as zero-cost collars and forward sales contracts.  Clawbacks 
To the extent not in violation of applicable law, the Company reserves the right to recover, or clawback, from current or former directors and officers any wrongfully earned performance-based compensation, including stock-based awards, upon the determination by the Compensation Committee that: 
Tax Gross-Up Provisions 
The Company has not entered into any new agreements that include excise tax gross-up provisions with respect to payments contingent upon a change in control since the adoption of such a policy by the Compensation Committee in February 2011. No executives are eligible for an excise tax gross-up. 
The Compensation Committee has exclusive authority to modify, interpret and enforce this policy in compliance with applicable law. 
Accounting and Tax Implications — Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
In developing compensation programs, the Compensation Committee reviews the estimated accounting and tax impact of all elements of the executive compensation program. Generally, an accounting expense is accrued over the requisite service period of the particular pay element (generally equal to the performance period) and the Company realizes a tax deduction upon payment to, or realization by, the executive. Previously, many of the awards granted were generally intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under IRC Section 162(m). However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), which became law on December 22, 2017, significantly amended IRC Section 162(m). Pursuant to the Act, the definition of "covered employees" under IRC Section 162(m) was amended to expand the scope of executive officers subject to the deduction limitation, including coverage of a company's chief financial officer. The Act also eliminated the performance-based compensation exception with respect to tax years beginning January 1, 2018, but included a transition rule with respect to compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified after that date. Accordingly, commencing in 2018, the Company's tax deduction with regard to compensation of "covered employees" is limited to $1 million per taxable year for each officer. 
While it is a goal of the Compensation Committee to maximize the deductibility of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to compensate officers in a manner commensurate with performance and the competitive environment for executive talent, while also consistent with its compensation philosophy and in the Company's and its stockholders' best interests. Accordingly, achieving these goals may have resulted (and may continue to result, in light of the recent changes in law) in compensation that, in certain cases, is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The Compensation Committee did not make any significant changes to the Company's executive compensation program for 2018 in response to the changes to IRC Section 162(m).  Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the potential risks arising from our compensation policies, practices and programs to determine whether any potential risks are material to the Company. In approving the 2018 compensation program design, the Compensation Committee engaged in discussions with its independent compensation consultant and management regarding any potential risks and concluded that the Company's compensation policies and practices are designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to the Company's overall business strategy, do not incentivize employees, including executive officers, to take unnecessary or excessive risks, and that any risks arising from the Company's policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
In this review, the Compensation Committee considered the attributes of the Company's policies and practices, including:

  (a)  Consists of auto and gas allowance and supplemental disability premiums.  
  (b)  Represents Mr. Silvernail's personal use of the Company's leased aircraft. The Company's  methodology for calculating the value of the personal use of the Company leased aircraft is to calculate the incremental costs of such usage to the Company, which includes fuel, landing fees, hangar fees, catering, additional expenses related to the  crew and other expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred by the Company if the aircraft had not been used for personal travel.

 Narrative to 2018 Summary Compensation Table 
Perquisites and Supplemental Disability 
In addition to benefits generally available to all other U.S.-based non-union employees, the CEO and other NEOs receive an auto allowance and participate in a supplemental long-term disability program. The supplemental disability benefit is in addition to the group long-term disability benefit generally available to all U.S.-based non-union employees. The group long-term disability plan provides an annual benefit of 60% of the first $300,000 of base salary, or an annual maximum benefit of $180,000 per year. For the NEOs, the supplemental program provides an annual benefit of 60% of their base salary above $300,000, with a maximum supplemental benefit of $60,000 per year. The CEO is also offered the personal use of the Company leased aircraft (limited to 25 hours per year covered by the Company and up to an additional 25 hours per year for which the CEO is required to reimburse the Company for all incremental costs related to such additional use). 
Retirement Benefits 
The Company maintains a tax-qualified retirement plan for employees, the IDEX Corporation Savings Plan, in which the CEO and other NEOs participate, which consists of a 401(k) with a prescribed matching contribution (401(k)) and a defined contribution portion (Defined Contribution). 
Defined Contribution 
The Defined Contribution portion of the IDEX Corporation Savings Plan is an ongoing tax-qualified "defined contribution" plan that provides contributions based on a participant's compensation and a combination of the participant's age and years of service as shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Age + Years of Service   Company Contribution 
 Age + Years of Service   Company Contribution 
[END TABLE]
Under the plan, participants are entitled to receive the lump-sum value of their vested account at termination of employment subject to distribution rules under the law. Account balances are 100% vested after three years of service. 
401(k) 
The 401(k) is an ongoing tax-qualified "401(k)" plan that provides a matching contribution based on the employee's contribution up to 8% of eligible compensation. The maximum matching contribution by the Company is 4% of eligible compensation. The matching contribution vests 20% for each year of service and is 100% vested after 5 years of service.  2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards

(1)  Amounts reflect payment levels under the MICP at a percentage of base salary for each executive and a Business  Performance Factor of 0% for threshold, 100% for target and 200% for maximum. See "Short-Term Incentives" under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — 2018 Executive Compensation Program." The amounts actually earned by the  NEOs are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.  
(2)  Reflects the range of the number of shares of Common Stock that could be issued pertaining to the PSUs awarded  in 2018 under the IAP. The target number of PSUs is used to determine the grant date fair value for this award.  
(3)  Reflects closing price of Common Stock on the grant date, which is the fair market value of the stock under the  terms of the IAP.  
(4)  Represents the grant date fair value of PSUs and stock options granted under the IAP to each NEO in accordance  with FASB ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of those awards, see note 14 "Share-Based Compensation" of the financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. For PSUs, the grant date fair value is based on the probable outcome of the related performance conditions which reflects the target level of performance. The grant  date fair value of the PSUs granted in 2018 based on the maximum level of performance is as follows: Mr. Silvernail, $10,293,440; Mr. Grogan, $1,962,847; Mr. Ashleman, $2,785,889; Ms. Cade, $1,754,379; and Mr. Bucklew,  $1,334,736. With respect to PSUs, cumulative dividend equivalents are paid based on actual number of shares delivered at the end of the performance period. For options, the actual value an NEO realizes from the stock option will depend on the  difference between the market price of the underlying share at exercise and the exercise price of the stock option established at the time of the grant.

 Narrative to Nonqualified Deferred 
Compensation at 2018 Fiscal Year End Table 
Supplemental Executive Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plan 
Eligible employees may defer until a future date payment of all or any portion of their annual salary or bonus under the defined contribution portion of the SERP. Deferral elections may be made annually. These amounts are fully vested. The Company also contributes to an eligible employee's account additional amounts, as described below, that are fully vested after the employee has completed three years of service. 
The Company contributes an amount equal to 4% of the eligible employee's compensation up to the IRS limit on compensation reduced by the amount of any Company matching contribution that is made to the 401(k) Plan. Additionally, the Company makes annual contributions to the accounts of eligible employees based on the employee's compensation above the IRS limit on compensation in the Defined Contribution Plan, determined based on the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Sum of Participant's Age Plus Years of Service   Contribution Percentage   
 Sum of Participant's Age Plus Years of Service   Contribution Percentage   
 Less than 40     7.5   
 40 but less than 55     8.0   
 55 but less than 70     8.5   
 70 or more     9.0   
[END TABLE]
Certain eligible employees designated by the Compensation Committee, including the NEOs, also receive an additional contribution equal to 2% of the employee's compensation. 
Deferred Compensation Account 
All amounts deferred are recorded in a memorandum account for each employee and are credited or debited with earnings or losses as if such amounts had been invested in either an interest-bearing account or receive an investment return as if the funds were invested in certain mutual funds, as selected by the employee. The deferred compensation credited to the interest-bearing account is adjusted on at least a quarterly basis with hypothetical earnings equal to the lesser of the Barclays Capital Long Term Bond AAA — Corporate Bond Index as of the first business day in November of the calendar year preceding the year for which the earnings are to be credited or 120% of the long-term applicable Federal rate as of the first business day in November. The memorandum accounts are not funded, and the right to receive future payments of amounts recorded in these accounts is an unsecured claim against the Company's general assets. 
The deferred compensation account amounts are payable upon separation of service within the meaning of IRC Section 409A; however, no benefits are payable prior to the date that is six months after the date of separation of service, or the date of death of the employee, if earlier. Account balances will be paid either in a single lump sum or in up to ten substantially equal annual installments, as elected by the employee at the time he or she first becomes eligible for the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
Prior to separation from service, amounts may be paid only on the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency, within the meaning of IRC Section 409A. On the occurrence of a change in control event within the meaning of IRC Section 409A, all amounts become vested and are distributed at that time in a single lump-sum payment. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or 
Change in Control 
Mr. Silvernail 
The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Silvernail effective as of February 22, 2018. The employment agreement provides for a term of approximately four years (expiring December 31, 2021) and is substantially similar to Mr. Silvernail's prior   employment agreement. If Mr. Silvernail's employment is terminated by the Company other than for "cause" and not in connection with a "change in control" (each as defined in the employment agreement), then, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims and his continued compliance with applicable restrictive covenants, he will receive (i) continuing salary payments and health benefits for 24 months following termination, (ii) a pro rata portion of his annual bonus for the year in which his termination occurs (based on the portion of the year he was employed), (iii) a payment equal to 200% of his base salary payable over 24 months commencing approximately 60 days after his termination, (iv) fully accelerated vesting and immediate exercisability of all unvested time-based equity awards (the "time-based acceleration"), and such awards will remain exercisable for one year following the date of termination of Mr. Silvernail's employment or until expiration of the option term, if earlier, and (v) vesting of all unvested performance-based equity awards granted prior to February 22, 2018 on the December 31 next following his termination of employment with respect to that number of shares of Common Stock (or performance units or dividend equivalents, as applicable) based on the performance level achieved with respect to the performance goal(s) under each such award from the beginning date of the performance period applicable thereto through such December 31 (the "performance-based acceleration"). Vesting of all unvested performance-based equity awards granted on or following February 22, 2018 will occur at the end of the applicable performance period with respect to that number of shares of Common Stock (or performance units or dividend equivalents, as applicable) based on the performance level achieved through the end of such performance period. 
If Mr. Silvernail's employment is terminated due to his disability or death, he or his estate, as applicable, will receive a pro rata portion of his annual bonus for the year in which his termination occurs (based on the portion of the year he was employed) as well as the time-based acceleration and the performance-based acceleration with respect to performance-based equity awards granted prior to February 22, 2018, as described above. With respect to the time-based acceleration, (i) for time-based awards granted before February 22, 2018, such awards will remain exercisable for one year following the date of such termination of employment or until expiration of the option term, if earlier, and (ii) for time-based awards granted on or following February 22, 2018, such awards will remain exercisable for five years following the date of termination of employment, or until expiration of the term, if earlier. Additionally, under Mr. Silvernail's employment agreement, in the case of such termination for disability or death, vesting of all unvested performance-based equity awards granted on or following February 22, 2018 will vest at the end of the applicable performance period with respect to that number of shares of Common Stock (or performance units or dividend equivalents, as applicable) based on the performance level achieved through the end of such performance period. 
If Mr. Silvernail's employment is terminated due to his retirement (as defined in the employment agreement) (i) he will receive the time-based acceleration, with such time-based awards granted before February 22, 2018 remaining exercisable for one year following the date of termination of employment or until expiration of the option term, if earlier, and with such time-based awards granted on or following February 22, 2018, remaining exercisable for five years following the date of termination of employment or until expiration of the option term, if earlier and (ii) he will receive (A) the performance-based acceleration with respect to performance-based equity awards granted prior to February 22, 2018 and (B) vesting at the end of the applicable performance period with respect to that number of shares of Common Stock (or performance units or dividend equivalents, as applicable) based on the   performance level achieved through the end of such performance period, with respect to all unvested performance-based equity awards granted on or following February 22, 2018. 
If Mr. Silvernail's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by him for "good reason" (as defined in the employment agreement), in either case, in contemplation of or within the 24 month period following a change in control, then, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims and his continued compliance with applicable restrictive covenants, he will receive (i) continuing salary payments and health benefits for 36 months following termination, (ii) a pro rata portion of his annual bonus for the year in which his termination occurs (based on the portion of the year he was employed), (iii) a payment equal to 300% of his base salary, payable over 36 months commencing approximately 60 days after his termination, (iv) time-based acceleration and (v) in lieu of performance-based acceleration, a cash payment in respect of all performance-based equity awards with respect to which he has not yet received payment, based on the performance level achieved with respect to the performance goal(s) under each such award from the beginning date of the performance period applicable thereto through such change in control, with such cash payment adjusted to reflect hypothetical earnings (equal to the lesser of the Barclays Long Aaa US Corporate Index or 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, in each case, determined as of the first business day of November of the calendar year preceding the change in control and compounded) for the period between such change in control and the date of payment. 
In addition, to the extent that any payment or benefit received in connection with a change in control would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the IRC, such payments and/or benefits will be subject to a "best pay cap" reduction if such reduction would result in a greater net after-tax benefit to Mr. Silvernail than receiving the full amount of such payments. 
Mr. Silvernail is subject to the non-competition and employee and business non-solicitation covenants set forth in the Confidential Information, Work Product and Restrictive Covenant Agreement previously entered into between Mr. Silvernail and the Company. 
Messrs. Grogan, Ashleman and Bucklew and Ms. Cade 
The Company has entered into letter agreements with Messrs. Grogan, Ashleman and Bucklew and Ms. Cade providing for (a) severance pay in an amount equal to two times the sum of the executive's annual base salary and target MICP bonus in the event of an involuntary termination within two years following a change in control, payable over the 24 month period following termination and (b) severance pay in an amount equal to the sum of one year of salary and target MICP bonus in the event of an involuntary termination without cause other than in connection with a change in control, in exchange for a signed release. 
Equity Awards 
The IAP provides that if a change in control occurs, then each outstanding award will continue in effect, or be assumed or an equivalent award substituted by the Company's successor; provided, that if the grantee incurs a termination of service without cause or for good reason (each as defined in the IAP) within 24 months following such change in control, the awards will become fully exercisable and all forfeiture restrictions will lapse. If an outstanding award is not assumed or substituted upon a change in control or if, following a change in control, neither the Company nor its successor has equity securities that are readily tradable on a regulated securities exchange, then the awards will vest in full.  2017 and 2018 PSU Grants 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the award agreements for PSUs granted in 2017 and 2018 provide that if a change in control occurs, the grantee will receive a cash payment in respect of such PSUs valued based on the actual level of achievement of the performance goals against target measured as of the date of the change in control, including dividend equivalents earned up to the change in control, with such value adjusted to the date of payment to reflect hypothetical earnings (equal to the lesser of the Barclays Long Aaa U.S. Corporate Index or 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, in each case, determined as of the first business day of November of the calendar year preceding the change in control and compounded) for the period between such change in control and the date of payment. The cash payment will be paid as soon as practicable following the earliest to occur of the following events: (i) if, as of the time of the change in control, the grantee is eligible for retirement, as of the date of the change in control, (ii) as of the date the grantee first becomes eligible for retirement following the change in control if that date occurs prior to the end of the performance period, (iii) if the grantee's service is terminated by the Company without cause or by the grantee for good reason and the date of termination occurs (or the event giving rise to good reason occurs), in each case, within 24 months following the change in control, on the date of such termination, (iv) if the grantee remains employed through the end of the applicable performance period, as of the end of the applicable performance period, or (v) if the grantee's employment is terminated due to death or disability prior to the end of the performance period, as of the date of death or disability. 
Termination due to Death, Disability or Retirement 
The award agreements for stock options and restricted stock awards provide that if the grantee's service is terminated by reason of death, disability or retirement, the award will become fully vested and exercisable. The award agreements for the 2017 PSU grants provide that if the grantee's service is terminated by reason of death, disability or retirement, the PSUs and any dividend equivalents thereon will become fully vested and earned based on the actual level of achievement of the performance goals against target measured through the December 31 following the date of termination. The award agreements for the 2018 PSU grants provide that if the grantee's service is terminated by reason of death, disability or retirement, the PSUs and any dividend equivalents thereon will become fully vested and earned based on the actual level of achievement of the performance goals against target measured through the end of the performance period. 
SERP 
Pursuant to the SERP, if a change in control occurs then not later than the closing date for the change in control event the amount credited to each participant's deferred compensation account shall be distributed in one lump sum in cash and/or Common Stock. 
Quantification of Termination Payments and Benefits — Change in Control 
The following tables set forth the amount each NEO would receive in the event of a termination of employment, as severance or as a result of accelerated vesting if his or her employment was terminated without cause or for good reason, or for disability or death, upon a change in control or in connection with a termination of employment following a change in control, using the following assumptions:  All potential termination payments set forth in the tables below reflect full payments under the potential scenarios and do not reflect any reductions that could occur if the payment is subject to excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

 CEO and Median Employee Pay Ratio 
We believe our executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to perform in ways that enhance stockholder value. We are committed to providing market-competitive compensation and to internal pay equity. The following CEO to median employee pay ratio is provided pursuant to Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
Methodology for Identifying the Median Employee 
The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our CEO's annual total compensation in 2018 to that of the median employee for the same period. The Company used total annual cash compensation (salary/hourly earnings, commissions, bonuses paid, and allowances/fixed payments) as of December 31, 2017 to determine the median employee. The Company determined there were no changes to the employee population or employee compensation arrangements over the last fiscal year that would result in a significant change to the pay ratio disclosure and as permitted under the Item 402(u) median employee identification instructions, elected to use the same median employee in the 2018 calculation. Under the Item 402(u)(4)(ii) ("de minimis") exemption, the Company may exclude non-United States employees up to a 5% threshold when identifying the median employee. As noted in last year's Proxy Statement, in determining such median employee, the Company excluded 220 employees from the following jurisdictions, comprising less than 5% of the 6,957 total Company population (with number of employees): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Brazil (9)      Ireland (33)      Poland (2)      United Arab Emirates (13)   
 Brazil (9)      Ireland (33)      Poland (2)      United Arab Emirates (13)   
[END TABLE]
The 6,737 employees who were included in identifying the median employee are located in the following countries: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Germany      Switzerland      United States of America   
 Germany      Switzerland      United States of America   
[END TABLE]
Pay Ratio 
We calculated annual total compensation for the median employee consistent with the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. The annual total compensation of the CEO is $10,125,650. The median of the annual total compensation of all employees, except the CEO, is $63,175. The pay ratio is 160:1.

PROPOSAL 2 — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
We are soliciting a non-binding advisory vote (say-on-pay) on the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative disclosure set forth in this Proxy Statement, as required under Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
The Company maintains a balanced approach to executive compensation with a mix of both cash and non-cash awards and short- and long-term incentives, with total direct compensation targeted within a range that includes market median for comparable positions at comparable companies. Where an individual executive's target compensation is positioned within the competitive range is based on the individual factors listed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Actual compensation in any given year should and does vary from target based on Company and individual performance. In this way, the Company motivates and rewards both vital short-term performance and long-term value creation. The Board of Directors strongly endorses the Company's executive compensation program and recommends that the stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and accompanying narrative discussion contained in this Proxy Statement. 
Because the vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Company. However, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote in determining future compensation policies and decisions. Currently, stockholders are given an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on this topic annually, with the next opportunity occurring in connection with the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. The Committee discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by the Auditing Standard No. 16, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in PCAOB Release No. 2012-004 and approved by the SEC in Release No. 34-68453, and reviewed the results of the independent registered public accounting firm's examination of the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Deloitte & Touche LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, discussed with the auditors their independence, and satisfied itself as to the auditors' independence. 
Based on the above reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommends to the Board of Directors that the financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's previous filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that might incorporate future filings made by the Company under those statutes, in whole or in part, this report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any such filings, nor will this report be incorporated by reference into any future filings made by the Company under those statutes.

All such fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the pre-approval policy discussed below.

(1)  Audit fees represent the aggregate fees billed for the audit of the Company's financial statements, review  of the financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports, and services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.  
(2)  Audit fees include $655,354 of additional fees related to the 2017 audit of the Company's financial  statements that were billed after the Company's 2018 Proxy Statement was filed on March 16, 2018.  
(3)  Audit-related fees represent the aggregate fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably  related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements and are not reported under audit fees.  
(4)  Tax fees represent the aggregate fees billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax  planning.  
(5)  All other fees represent the aggregate fees billed for products and services that are not included in the audit  fees, audit-related fees, and tax fees. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of these services is not incompatible with maintaining the Deloitte Entities' independence.  
[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by the Deloitte Entities. For audit services, the accounting firm provides the Audit Committee with an audit services plan during the second quarter of each fiscal year outlining the scope of the audit services proposed to be performed for the fiscal year and the associated fees. This audit services plan must be formally accepted by the Audit Committee. 
For non-audit services, management submits to the Audit Committee for approval during the second quarter of each fiscal year and from time-to-time during the fiscal year a list of non-audit services that it recommends the Audit Committee engage the accounting firm to provide for the current year, along with the associated fees. Company management and the accounting firm each confirm to the Audit Committee that any non-audit service on the list is permissible under all applicable legal requirements. 
The Audit Committee approves both the list of permissible non-audit services and the budget for such services. The Audit Committee delegates to its Chair the authority to amend or modify the list of approved permissible non-audit services and fees. The Chair reports any such actions taken to the Audit Committee at a subsequent Audit Committee meeting.

PROPOSAL 3 — APPROVAL OF AUDITORS 
The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will attend the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Although the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the corporate governance listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange require that the Audit Committee be directly responsible for selecting and retaining the independent registered public accounting firm, we are providing stockholders with the opportunity to express their views on this issue. While this vote cannot be binding, if the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Audit Committee will take the vote into account in making future appointments.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. 
Based solely on its review of the copies of the forms it received, or written representations from reporting persons, the Company believes that all filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders were met during the year ended December 31, 2018.
