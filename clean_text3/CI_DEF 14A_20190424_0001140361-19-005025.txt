 Mission and Strategy   
 Cigna's mission is dedicated to improving the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve around the globe. Our strategic focus in support                  of our mission is to Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond in order to expand avenues for growth and performance. Creating value for our customers, clients, partners, communities and, in turn, our shareholders, is a direct result of the                  continued, effective execution of this proven strategy.   
 Our Mission  
 To improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve  
 Our Strategy  
     Go Deeper:    To expand and deepen our customer, client and partner relationships; depth in targeted sub-segments and geographies      
     Go Local:    To ensure our solution suite and services meet customer, client and partner needs at a local market level      
     Go Beyond:    To innovate and further differentiate our businesses, the experiences we deliver, and overall social impact      
 How We Win  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 For the past decade, we have been a leader in creating value-based, collaborative partnerships, with nearly 600 value-based care arrangements in place around the                  country. During this time, we have progressed steadily beyond the financing of sick care and strive to provide services and solutions designed to help people live well and be better equipped to prevent and manage health challenges.  
 In 2018, we accelerated the execution of our strategy through the combination with Express Scripts Holding Company (Express Scripts). We now have even more                  opportunities to accelerate the pace of change, and to help deliver on the critical priority of building a more sustainable model for health care. Together, as we enhance delivery of whole person health, we will address the need for greater                  affordability, choice and predictability by leveraging a significantly stronger medical and pharmacy cost position, as well as coupling more actionable insights and analytics with enhanced clinical and care coordination capabilities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Our Values  
 Cigna and Express Scripts share a commitment to supporting local communities and improving societal health. In furtherance of this commitment, we announced a $200                  million investment in our foundation and our communities. In January 2019, we launched Healthier Kids for Our Future, a $25 million five-year global initiative to improve the health and well-being of children. Cigna's 74,000 global                  employees will work together to put children on a healthier path, starting with reducing childhood hunger and improving nutrition in local communities.

Three of the new directors have                  strong backgrounds in health services and delivery systems, as well as experience in regulated industries and public policy. Certain of our new directors have experience in finance, marketing and consumer insights, and as business leaders.                  These new directors enhance the Board's ethnic and gender diversity, as well as the diversity of backgrounds, skills and experiences on the Board which together support Cigna's mission and strategy.  
• Creation of Compliance Committee. The Board evaluated its structure, particularly its committee structure, in light of the Express Scripts merger. Following this                  review, the Board approved the creation of a Compliance Committee. The Compliance Committee oversees the Company's key compliance and ethics programs, including compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to business operations,                  such as data privacy and U.S. federal and state health care program requirements.  
• Corporate Governance Guidelines. In July 2018, the Board approved amendments to its Corporate Governance Guidelines to require the Corporate Governance Committee, and any search firm it engages, to include women and minority candidates in the pool from which the Committee selects director candidates.

 Executive Compensation   
 Cigna's executive compensation program is based on the philosophy that executive pay should strongly align with the interests of our shareholders, directly link to                  Company and individual performance and attract and retain executive talent. We believe that tying executive compensation to the achievement of our enterprise goals will result in the creation of meaningful and sustained long-term value for                  our shareholders. Each of the measures in our performance-based plans are designed to align with, and support, our business strategy. We focus on driving enterprise profitability and growth to support investment in innovation, customer                  retention and shareholder return.   
 In 2018, our shareholders cast advisory votes in favor of our executive compensation program, with approximately 93% of votes cast in favor.

 Emphasis on Performance Based Compensation   
 The pay mix for the Chief Executive Officer and the other named executive officers (NEOs) during 2018 reflects our executive compensation philosophy that emphasizes                  performance-based compensation over fixed compensation. As illustrated in the charts below, performance-based compensation represented approximately 92% of Mr. Cordani's total direct compensation for 2018, including 67% in long-term                  incentives and 25% in annual incentives. On average, performance-based compensation represented 83% of total direct compensation for the other NEOs that served as executive officers at the end of 2018 (not including Mr. Wentworth who became                  an executive officer at the closing of the merger), including an average of 49% in long-term incentives and 34% in annual incentives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 *   For purposes of this chart, Mr. Wentworth is not included due to the timing of his appointment as an executive officer, and Mr. Hocevar and Dr.                    Muney are not included because they did not serve as executive officers at the end of 2018.

 Voting Matters and Board Recommendations   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS   MORE                   INFORMATION      
     For the reasons set forth below and as further detailed throughout this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors unanimously                   recommends that you vote FOR each of the management proposals.      
                           Proposal 1. Election of Directors.                                         The Board and the Corporate Governance Committee believe that the thirteen director nominees named in this Proxy Statement bring a combination of diverse qualifications, skills and experiences that contribute to a well-rounded Board. As                  determined by the Board and Corporate Governance Committee, each director nominee has proven leadership ability, good judgment and is a valued participant on the Board.   Page 7      
                           Proposal 2. Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation.                                         The Board believes that Cigna's executive compensation program design effectively aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by tying a significant portion of their compensation to Cigna's performance and                  rewarding our executive officers for the creation of long-term value for Cigna's shareholders. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board and People Resources Committee value your opinion and                  will review and consider the voting results when making future executive compensation decisions.   Page 33      
                           Proposal 3. Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019.                                         The Audit Committee approved the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Cigna's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers                  LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. As a matter of good corporate governance, the Board is seeking shareholder ratification of the                  appointment.   Page 77      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS   MORE                   INFORMATION      
     For the reasons set forth below and as further detailed throughout this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors unanimously                   recommends that you vote AGAINST each of the shareholder proposals.                       
                           Proposal 4. Increase Shareholder Rights to Include Action by Written Consent.                                         The Board believes that the implementation of this proposal is not in the best interests of shareholders or the Company and is unnecessary, given the Company's strong corporate governance practices and policies, including the ability of                  shareholders to act through proxy access. Unlike written consents, taking action at shareholder meetings allows for accurate and complete information about the proposed shareholder action to be widely distributed, ensuring an opportunity                  for well-informed discussion and consideration of the merits of the proposed action. This proposal would circumvent the protections, procedural safeguards and advantages provided to all shareholders by shareholder meetings.   Page 81      
                           Proposal 5. Cyber Risk Report.                                         The Company provides comprehensive disclosure related to cyber security risks and data protection, consistent with the SEC's rules and guidance in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. We describe the Board's oversight of risk, including cyber                  security risk, in this Proxy Statement. In addition, the Company provides detailed supplemental information about our information protection policies, practices and procedures related to information protection and cyber security in our                  annual Corporate Responsibility Report. If a material cyber event were to occur, we would provide disclosure of the event consistent with the SEC's guidance. Therefore, the Board does not believe that providing a separate cyber security                  report is necessary.   Page 85      
                           Proposal 6. Gender Pay Gap Report.                                         Cigna is committed to pay equity and recognizes that our continued success depends on the collective strengths of our employees and we are dedicated to attracting, retaining and rewarding the performance of our diverse workforce to best                  meet the needs of our customers. The recruiting, training and compensation programs at Cigna are designed to prevent gender pay differences and reduce the risks identified in the proposal. Cigna performs regular pay equity data analysis to                  proactively review and address pay disparities not explained by objective factors. The Board believes that adoption of the proposal is unnecessary as it would not enhance Cigna's already established commitment to pay equity and diversity                  and inclusion.

 AREAS OF EXPERTISE REFLECTED ON Cigna'S                     BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
 Business Leader  
 Directors who have served as a chief executive officer, a CEO-equivalent or a business unit leader of a large company bring a practical understanding of large organizations,                  processes, strategy and risk management.   
 Finance  
 An understanding of finance, capital markets and financial reporting processes is necessary for a well-rounded Board because of the importance we place on accurate financial                  reporting and robust financial controls and compliance. In addition, Cigna's business involves complex financial transactions.  
 Health Services and Delivery Systems  
 As we work to create a sustainable health care ecosystem, the Board values directors with experience on issues related to improving access to care and reducing health costs                  to patients through the provision of care management and the use of innovative delivery system solutions.  
 Information Technology  
 Effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care professionals are integral to the operation of our                  business. For this reason, the Board benefits from directors with leadership experience related to the development, installation, implementation, security or maintenance of computer systems, applications and digital informatics.  
 International/Global  
 The Board values directors with leadership experience overseeing non-U.S. operations and working in diverse cultures around the globe.  
 Marketing and Consumer Insights  
 Our customer-focused strategy benefits from inclusion of directors with leadership experience in marketing, advertising and consumer insight functions. These directors also                  have experience with product development and brand building, particularly as it focuses on end-user consumers.  
 Regulated Industry/Public Policy  
 Our business is highly regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. For this reason, the Board benefits from directors with experience in regulated                  industries and public policy to help us identify, assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment.

 Limits on Public Company                   Directorships   To ensure each director is able to devote sufficient time and attention to his or her responsibilities as a board member, the Board has established the following limits                  on outside directorships:  
• Each director who also is a chief executive officer of a public company may not serve on more than one other public company board in addition to Cigna's Board and the                  board of his or her employer (for a total of three public company directorships); and  
• Each director who is not a chief executive officer of a public company may serve on no more than four boards of other public companies (for a total of five such                  directorships).  
 All of our directors are in compliance with these limits on outside directorships.  
 Change in Director's Principal                   Position   If a director changes his or her principal employment position, that director is required to tender his or her resignation from the Board to the Corporate Governance                  Committee. The Committee will then recommend to the Board whether to accept or decline the resignation.  
 Retirement Age   Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors are expected to retire by the annual meeting of shareholders coinciding with or following his or her 72nd birthday.   
 Continuing Education for Directors   The Board is regularly updated on Cigna's businesses, strategies, customers, operations and employee matters, as well as external trends and issues that affect the                  Company. Directors also are encouraged to attend continuing education courses relevant to their service on Cigna's Board at Cigna's expense. Cigna regularly makes the Board aware of continuing education opportunities that may be of                  interest. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees the continuing education practices and the Company is kept apprised of director participation.

Resources         Committees are independent and the members of the Audit Committee and the People Resources Committee meet the NYSE's heightened independence requirements for service on those committees. BOARD           LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE The Board is         committed to the long-term growth of the business and the successful execution of our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve around the globe. To fulfill its responsibilities to our shareholders, Cigna's         Board, both directly and through its committees, regularly engages with management, ensures management accountability and reviews critical issues that face Cigna. The Board is committed to meeting the dynamic needs of the Company and focusing on         the interests of its shareholders and, as a result, regularly evaluates and adapts its composition, role and relationship with management. Independent Chairman of the           Board We currently         separate the roles of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Our CEO sets the strategic direction for the Company, working with the Board, and provides day-to-day leadership, while our Chairman leads the Board in the performance of         its duties and serves as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the CEO. We believe that having an independent Chairman assists the Board in ensuring independent oversight of the Company and the management team. The Board         regularly assesses the appropriateness of this leadership structure and has concluded that this structure best suits Cigna's needs at this time. In December         2018, the Board re-elected Isaiah Harris, Jr. to serve as our independent Chairman for a three-year term, subject to his annual election to the Board by shareholders. The full Board evaluates the Chairman's performance on an annual basis as part of         the annual Board evaluation.

The Chair of the         Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the feedback from the individual director interviews with the Chairman of the Board and each of the Committee Chairs. The Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Chairman of the Board then led an         in-person discussion with the full Board, during which the Board discussed key areas of focus for the upcoming year, including the Express Scripts merger and business strategy. The chairs of each committee led a similar self-assessment discussion         for their particular committee. From time to         time, the Board has engaged an independent third party to conduct the Board evaluation, most recently in 2014. The Corporate Governance Committee and Board have agreed to use an independent third party to facilitate the Board evaluation process         approximately every three to five years, or on an as needed basis.The results of         the evaluation process support the Board's belief that the Board and committees are operating effectively. Board Succession Planning and           OrientationThe Corporate         Governance Committee is responsible for identifying new director candidates, reviewing the composition of the Board and its committees and for making recommendations to the full Board on these matters. When identifying new candidates for the Board,         the Committee focuses on identifying candidates that possess skills and qualifications that will support the Company's short- and long-term strategy, while being mindful of the ongoing significant complexity and uncertainty within the health         service industry, as well as upcoming planned retirements. The Committee's objective is to balance the knowledge and insights gained from long-term service on the Board with the new skills and experience that results from adding directors to the         Board, at a pace that allows the Board to maintain its high-performing and effective culture. In July 2018, the Board amended the Guidelines to require the Corporate Governance Committee, and any search firm it engages, to include women and         minority candidates in the pool from which the Committee selects director candidates. In 2018, the Board added five new directors — Mr. William DeLaney, General Elder Granger, Ms. Kathleen Mazzarella, Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. William Roper. These         new directors bring a diversity of backgrounds, skills and experiences to the Board. For more information on our new directors, see "Election of Directors — 2018 Board Composition Developments" and " — Commitment to Board Diversity."New directors         undergo an extensive Board and committee orientation process, overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee. The orientation process is designed to enable new members of the Board to quickly become active, knowledgeable and effective Board         members. As part of this process, each new director receives a series of briefings designed to provide meaningful interactions with our executive officers and

ANNUAL                   POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND LOBBYING ACTIVITY REPORT Cigna is committed         to transparency and strives to provide clarity about our goals and positions related to the Company's federal and state lobbying and advocacy efforts, as well as why we believe active engagement in the public policy arena is important to our         mission, business and customers. Cigna has engaged with shareholders to gain feedback regarding desired political contribution disclosure and published its first annual political contributions and lobbying activity report in 2011. Our report         provides information on our overall lobbying framework, including the areas in which we focus our advocacy efforts and why we believe active engagement in the public policy arena is necessary to support the achievement of our mission, the success         of our business and the well-being of our customers. The report also provides information about: (1) direct political contributions that Cigna makes at a corporate level; (2) contributions that Cigna makes through the Cigna Political Action         Committee; and (3) the total amount of dues paid to any industry trade association to which Cigna pays $50,000 or more in annual dues, as well as the portion of any such dues that such trade associations inform us are allocable to any         non-deductible lobbying expenses. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees Cigna's political and lobbying activities. The Company updates the report annually and we encourage you to review our 2018 report which is available on Cigna's website at         www.cigna.com/about-us/corporate-governance/. CERTAIN           TRANSACTIONS Transactions with Related Persons         Cigna has not         adopted a written policy concerning the review, approval or ratification of related person transactions. Cigna compiles information about transactions between Cigna and Cigna's directors, director nominees, executive officers and any immediate         family members and affiliated entities identified by directors, director nominees and executive officers as having any form of relationship with Cigna, as well as shareholders that identified themselves since the beginning of 2018 as beneficially         owning more than 5% of Cigna's common stock. Cigna's Office of the Corporate Secretary analyzes the nature of any transaction to determine whether the transaction may require disclosure under SEC rules as a related person transaction. On an annual         basis, the Corporate Governance Committee reviews the analysis prepared by the Company, and presents its assessment to the full Board of Directors. Based on this         review, there are no related person transactions in 2018 requiring disclosure under SEC rules.

MIP Performance Measures and Goals       Each year, the         Committee sets enterprise performance measures, weightings and goals for annual incentive awards based on Cigna's business priorities and annual operating plan. The operating plan aligns with our strategy, long-term commitment to our customers,         clients, communities and shareholders and expected performance in the industry. The Committee works with its independent compensation consultant to evaluate the appropriateness of these measures and weightings and the degree of challenge in the MIP         performance goals. The measures are designed to align with, and drive execution of, the Company's business strategy. For 2018, performance measures included adjusted income from operations, revenue, operating expense ratio improvement and strategic         priorities. More detailed information on these measures is included in the 2018 Performance Goals, Measures and Actual Results table. For each MIP         goal other than strategic priorities, the Committee specifies certain below target, target and above target levels of performance. To aid the Committee in setting the financial performance targets, and to assess the reasonableness and rigor of         those targets, the Committee's compensation consultant annually presents a comprehensive report to the Committee that evaluates Cigna's historical relationship between pay and performance in comparison with Cigna's compensation peer group. The         compensation consultant also reviews performance goals determined by the Committee in the context of historical performance and analyst expectations of future performance for Cigna and Cigna's SPS performance peer group. The strategic         priorities measure emphasizes the importance of incentivizing and recognizing progress in certain areas beyond financial results that support our business strategy. For this measure, the Committee evaluates the Company's progress relative to key         strategic categories. For 2018, the key strategic categories are: (1) customer, client and reputational focus; (2) employee engagement; and (3) enterprise focus on compliance.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 STEP 1                   Achieve Earnings Minimum  
 The Committee believes that achieving Cigna's profitability goals is critically important to the long-term success of the business. In recognition of this importance,                  the Committee establishes a minimum level of adjusted income from operations that must be achieved for the year in order for any MIP award to be earned. If the Company does not meet that pre-defined minimum level, then no annual incentives                  will be paid to executive officers.   
 STEP 2                   Company Performance Drives Funding Level  
 If the Company achieves the earnings minimum, the Committee may fund the executive officer MIP pool from 0% to 200% of the aggregate targets for all executive officers                  based upon whether each performance measure is below target, at target, or above target. The following table sets forth the ranges between which the MIP pool may be funded for each performance measure, in each case, assuming the earnings                  minimum has been achieved:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Measure   Performance   Funding Range      
     Adjusted income from                   operations                   Revenue                   Operating expense ratio improvement   Above target range   120% to 200%      
     Within target range   80% to 120%      
     Below target range   Less than 80%      
     Strategic Priorities   The Committee evaluates progress in the three key strategic                   categories year over year.      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Company's actual performance relative to each measure determines which funding range applies for purposes of that measure. However, the Committee maintains the                  discretion to determine at which point within that range the actual funding of the MIP pool will be set. In setting the actual funding percentage for each measure, the Committee considers Cigna's performance as a whole (both in absolute                  terms and relative to competitors), as well as Cigna's achievement of the goals within the performance measure. The MIP funding mechanisms ensure that a minimum level of performance is achieved and that NEOs' MIP awards reflect the                  Company's performance.  
 STEP 3                   Award Amounts Based on Individual Contributions to Company Performance  
 Once MIP funding has been determined, the Committee (and for Mr. Cordani, the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Committee) assesses each NEO's                  individual contributions and how such contributions impacted the achievement of the MIP goals to determine the individual award amounts. Actual awards can range from 0% to 200% of a NEO's MIP target, allowing the Committee to differentiate                  payouts based on each individual's contributions.

2018 Individual LTI Targets and         Awards A NEO's LTI target         is expressed as a dollar value and is determined based on the compensation peer group and the general industry peer group market data for the officer's role. In December 2017, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Committee, set Mr. Cordani's         LTI target as a range. At that time, the Committee also approved market-based adjustments for the other NEOs then serving as executive officers of Cigna to maintain the competitive positions of their target total direct compensation. For those         executive officers, the Committee set the target as an absolute dollar value, with the primary consideration being the comparison to the 50th percentile LTI level of         the market data for both peer groups. The Board expects         that, for Mr. Cordani, LTI awards will fall within the target range, but the Board is not restricted to the range when determining Mr. Cordani's LTI award. For the other executive officers, for 2018, an executive could receive a grant between 0%         and 200% of his or her individual target value. Mr. Cordani's LTI award continues to be based primarily on his individual contributions and enterprise performance, as well as an assessment of then-current market data. In determining awards for the         other NEOs, the Committee primarily evaluates individual contributions, but also may take into consideration enterprise performance, succession planning needs and other factors as circumstances warrant. 2018 LTI awards were delivered 50% in stock         options and 50% in SPS awards having a 2018–2020 performance period.

 Grants   
 At the time of grant, a total LTI dollar value is approved for each named executive officer. The SPS portion of                   the award (50% of the total LTI value) is converted into a specific number of SPSs on the grant date based on                   Cigna's stock price on that date.   
 Vesting   
 SPSs vest in the first quarter of the year following the end of the three-year performance period.  
 Payout Determination  
 The Committee determines a performance factor of 0% to 200% based on Company achievement of two                   pre-established measures during the performance period, and that factor is multiplied by each SPS award to determine the number of shares to be paid in respect of vested awards.  
 Measure: Relative TSR, compounded over the three-year performance period                                         Weighting: 50%                                         Alignment with Business Strategy: Rewards NEOs for stock performance relative to Cigna's applicable peer group at the time of the award                                         Comparator Group: The SPS performance peer group is used to measure relative TSR   Measure: Adjusted income from operations                                         Weighting: 50%                                         Alignment with Business Strategy: Reinforces the importance of sustained profitable growth across the enterprise                                         Threshold Performance: Performance that would result in funding of less than 35% of target yields no payment for this measure  
 Final Payout  
 SPS awards are ultimately settled in Cigna stock, so the actual value of the earned awards is based on                   Cigna's stock price at the time of payment.  
[END TABLE]
SPS awards         with a performance period that began prior to 2019 included as performance measures (1) relative TSR and (2) adjusted income from operations for Cigna's three business segments that were in place prior to the Express Scripts merger. For the SPS         programs for the 2017–2019 and 2018–2020 performance periods, the Committee approved changes to the adjusted income from operations performance targets for 2019 and 2020 in light of the merger. For performance periods beginning in 2019, this         measure will be determined on a consolidated, per share basis. No changes were made to the performance measures or targets for the 2016–2018 performance period.

Express         Scripts historically made contributions to senior executives' EDCP account in an amount equal to 6% of such senior executive's annual cash compensation, with the contributions subject to three-year cliff vesting. The Express Scripts board of         directors approved the contribution with respect to Mr. Wentworth's 2018 compensation in 2017. When an executive becomes eligible for retirement under the EDCP (minimum age of 55 and a combined age plus years of service with the company of 65), or         upon termination due to death or disability (as defined in the EDCP plan), all company-provided EDCP contributions vest in full. Upon termination for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, all unvested company-provided EDCP         contributions are forfeited. Withdrawals and distributions of vested amounts are made either upon termination or at a fixed time in a lump sum payment or pursuant to a previously specified fixed schedule. For information about the Company's         contribution to Mr. Wentworth's EDCP account in connection with the closing of the Express Scripts merger and the vesting of such contribution, see "Employment Arrangements and Post-Termination Payments —Retention Arrangements."Additional         information about deferred compensation can be found in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table and accompanying narrative.Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Cigna         Pension Plan and the Cigna Supplemental Pension Plan were frozen on July 1, 2009. Benefits earned under these plans have been determined based on eligible earnings through July 1, 2009. The freeze did not affect benefits earned before July 1, 2009.         The Company's NEOs hired before July 1, 2009 participated in the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan. Additional         information about pension benefits can be found in the Pension Benefits Table and accompanying narrative. Retirement Plans for         Non-U.S.-based Employees On July 1,         2018, Mr. Sadler relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Prior to that, he participated in the Mandatory Provident Fund program for Hong Kong employees. Hong Kong law requires employees to contribute 5% of their monthly salary up to a maximum         amount ($1,500 HKD or approximately $200 USD per month). Employers also are required to contribute 5% of the employee's monthly salary up to the same maximum amount. Employer contributions vest at a rate of 10% per year and are fully vested after         10 years of service. Participants may withdraw their lump sum benefit once they turn 60.As a citizen of         the United Kingdom working in Hong Kong and the UAE, Mr. Sadler also participates in Cigna's Third Country National Pension Plan.

$750,000 and         $2,500,000, respectively; and Mr. Sadler's 2019 LTI target was increased to $1,800,000. Changes to plan design for the MIP and LTI awards are described in "Annual Incentive — Annual Incentive Plan Changes for 2019," "Long-Term Incentives —         Strategic Performance Shares Program" and "Long-Term Incentives — LTI Changes for 2019."EMPLOYMENT                   ARRANGEMENTS AND          POST-TERMINATION PAYMENTS Employment Arrangements We typically do         not enter into individual employment contracts with our executive officers. Consistent with our approach of rewarding performance, employment is not guaranteed, and either Cigna or the executive officer may terminate the relationship at any time.         An executive officer receives an offer letter upon his or her hire or promotion that describes initial compensation terms, such as base salary, any sign-on or other cash bonus or equity awards, any relocation assistance and target opportunities for         annual cash incentive and long-term equity incentive compensation. Retention ArrangementsTimothy C.           Wentworth. To support the business integration and ongoing leadership of the Express Scripts business, we entered into a retention agreement with Mr. Wentworth. The retention agreement sets forth certain terms of his employment, as well as         specific compensation and benefits he is entitled to receive during the three-year retention period following the closing of the Express Scripts merger. In exchange for this agreement, Mr. Wentworth agreed to non-solicitation of customers and         employees and non-competition covenants applicable during his employment and for 24 months after his termination of employment for any reason, and perpetual confidentiality and non-disparagement covenants.During the         retention period, Mr. Wentworth will have an annual base salary of $1,500,000, a target annual incentive award opportunity of $2,625,000 (and a maximum potential award opportunity of 200% of such target opportunity), and an annual target long-term         incentive award opportunity of $6,000,000. These amounts were driven by his prior role as President and Chief Executive Officer of Express Scripts. If Mr. Wentworth is terminated without cause or terminates for good reason during the retention         period, he is entitled to receive a pro-rata bonus payment and a payment in respect of continuation of benefits.Under the         agreement, Mr. Wentworth was credited with a deferred compensation account balance of $8,250,000, which vests in equal monthly installments over the three-year period following the closing of the merger, subject to Mr. Wentworth's continued         employment through each monthly vesting date, or upon an earlier termination of

February 2018, the         Committee awarded Mr. Hocevar an LTI award with a grant value of $1,760,000, 110% of his target as part of the Company's annual LTI grant practice.In September 2018,         the Company and Mr. Hocevar executed an Agreement and Release (an A&R) in connection with his separation. The A&R includes customary confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition, non-disparagement and release provisions. In addition,         the agreement provided for benefits consisting of: (1) a cash payment of $116,346, payable in installments through December 31, 2018; (2) a cash payment of $2,258,654, payable between January 1, 2019 and March 15, 2019; and (3) payout of previously         awarded SPSs for the 2016–2018, 2017–2019 and 2018–2020 performance periods. In total, the estimated aggregate value of these benefits in cash and stock is approximately $4.7 million, based on a stock price of $207.09 per share, the closing price         of Cigna's common stock on October 12, 2018. The percentage of actual shares earned and timing of the payment of the SPS awards will be based on Company performance and determined by the People Resources Committee of the Board of Directors in         accordance with the terms of the LTIP. Mr. Hocevar's A&R provides that these amounts must be returned to the Company in the event there is a violation of the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of the A&R.Terms of Dr. Muney's Agreement           and ReleaseDr. Muney         retired effective December 21, 2018 upon the closing of the Express Scripts merger. The Committee had set Dr. Muney's base salary for 2018 at $625,000, his 2018 MIP target at $500,000 and his 2018 LTI target at $925,000. In February 2018, the         Committee awarded Dr. Muney an LTI award with a grant value of $925,000, 100% of his target as part of the Company's annual LTI grant practice.In January         2019, the Company and Dr. Muney executed an Agreement and Release in connection with his retirement. Dr. Muney's retirement constituted a termination upon a change of control under the Cigna Executive Severance Benefits Plan. Dr. Muney's A&R         provided for the following benefits: (1) a cash payment of $1,875,000 in the seventh calendar month after the retirement date (Basic Severance Pay under the Executive Severance Benefits Plan); (2) a cash payment of $1,833,000 in the seventh         calendar month after the retirement date (Supplemental Severance Pay under the Executive Severance Benefits Plan); (3) a cash payment of $500,000 payable between January 1, 2019 and March 15, 2019 as consideration for entering into the A&R; and         (4) payout of previously awarded SPSs for the 2016–2018, 2017–2019 and 2018–2020 performance periods. The A&R also provided that Dr. Muney's basic life insurance coverage would continue for one year following his retirement and that the Company         would provide reasonable outplacement services for six months. In addition, the agreement confirmed that, pursuant to the

Stock Ownership Guidelines We believe that         the ownership of meaningful levels of Cigna stock by our executive officers is a critical factor in aligning the long-term interests of management and our shareholders. To promote this goal, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines that apply to         all of our executive officers, including our NEOs. As of December 31, 2018, all of our NEOs are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines and each of our NEOs met or exceeded their ownership requirements, or are within the five-year share         accumulation period described below. The chart below shows the stock ownership requirements and actual value of holdings as a multiple of base salary as of December 31, 2018 for the CEO, the President, Express Scripts and Cigna Services and the         average of the other NEOs that served as executive officers at the end of 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Features of Our Stock Ownership Guidelines  
• Wholly owned shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock equivalents, and shares owned through benefit plans (such as investments in the Cigna stock fund of                  the Cigna 401(k) Plan or the deferred compensation plans) are counted toward meeting the guidelines. SPSs and stock options do not count toward meeting the ownership guidelines.  
• Executive officers have five years from date of hire, promotion or any other event that changes their multiple of base salary to meet their applicable ownership                  requirement. Prior to meeting their stock ownership requirement, executives may only engage in transactions that increase their holdings. Once an executive attains his or her required holding level, the executive must maintain the                  requirement on a continuous basis, even if the requirement is met before the end of the five-year period.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Share Retention Requirements Encourage a Long-Term Ownership Philosophy  
• Once ownership requirements are met,   
     ○   executive officers may not sell more than 50% of the shares held above their applicable guideline in any single open trading period; and  
     ○   executive officers must retain, for at least one year, a minimum of 50% of the shares acquired upon exercise of any stock options and 50% of the shares acquired upon vesting                  of restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants, net of shares withheld for taxes or payment of exercise prices, fees and expenses.

• CEO approval is required for all transactions in Cigna stock by executive officers.  
• General Counsel approval is required for all transactions in Cigna stock by the CEO.

compensation         in excess of the $500,000 per person deduction limit. While the Committee considers the impact of Section 162(m)(6), it believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting         the executive compensation program, even if non-deductible compensation expenses could result. Separately, the         Committee also considers the accounting consequences of its compensation decisions.

 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

 Proposal 4 - Increase Shareholder Rights to Include Action by Written Consent  
 Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of                  votes that would be necessary to authorize a specific action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act                  by written consent according to applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any appropriate topic for written consent.  
 This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major                  companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic might have received a still higher vote than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if small shareholders had the same access to independent corporate governance data on these                  companies as large shareholders.  
 Taking action by written consent in place of a special meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle and avoid                  the cost of a special meeting.  
 Shareholders can act by written consent to elect a new director. The following negative events indicate that director refreshment is needed:  
 DOJ Investigation into alleged fraudulent Medicare payments.                   May 2018  
 Consumer Fraud/Abuse – Class Action over alleged overcharged co-payment amounts of prescription drugs.                   May 2018  
 Consumer Fraud/Abuse – Proposed Class Action suit over alleged failure to provide long-term and short-term disability claims, Pennsylvania.                   January 2018  
 Class Action over calculation of plan benefits based on cash balance formula conversion; alleged ERISA violation, Amara lawsuit                   December 2017  
 Consumer Fraud/Abuse – Litigation over alleged failure to reimburse out-of-network services.                   December 2017  
 Consumer Fraud/Abuse – Purported Class Action over alleged over-charging and price fixing of home patient care and durable medical equipment, Texas.                   November 2017  
 Investigation into policies of health insurers in prescribing opioid medications.                   November 2017  
 The expectation of this written consent proposal is that shareholders will not need to make use of written consent because its mere existence will be an incentive factor                  that will help ensure that our company is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management.  
 Please vote yes:                   Increase Shareholder Rights to Include Action by Written Consent - Proposal 4

 Cyber Risk Report  
 Prior to becoming the Chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton wrote, "cyber-threats are among the most urgent risk to America's economic and national security and the personal                  safety of its citizens." In October 2017, the Co-Director of SEC Division of Enforcement identified cybersecurity disclosure as a priority and subject of potential enforcement "where there may be a cyber-related disclosure failure by a                  public company." Earlier this year the SEC updated its interpretive guidance on cybersecurity disclosure, further underlining its focus on this topic.  
 A 2018 report sponsored by IBM and conducted by the Ponemon Institute, found that healthcare data breaches cost organizations $408 per compromised record, more than 2.5                  times the global average across for all industries. In 2017, the Healthcare Industry Cybersecurity Task Force noted the industry experienced more cyber incidents resulting in data breaches than any of the other 15 critical infrastructure                  sectors. According to a 2016 report by the Ponemon Institute, data breaches in healthcare are increasingly costly and frequent, and continue to put patient data at risk. The report estimates that data breaches could be costing the                  healthcare industry $6.2 billion.  
 While Cigna Health Corporation's 2017 10-K gives a cursory description of cyber risks, we believe it does not adequately disclose the full extent of those risks and how they                  are mitigated. Given the magnitude of cyber risk in the healthcare industry, shareholders need a full report that includes policies, procedures, or other information concerning how it mitigates this risk.  
 RESOLVED: The Company's shareholders ask the Board to review and publicly report (at reasonable cost, in a reasonable timeframe, and omitting proprietary and confidential                  information) on its cyber risk and actions taken to mitigate that risk. A report adequate for investors to assess practices should include:  
 aspects of business or operations that give rise to material cyber risk;  
 the extent to which the Company outsources functions that have material cyber risks, descriptions of those functions and how the Company addresses those risks;  
 descriptions of cyber incidents experienced by the Company that individually or in the aggregate are material, including a description of costs and consequences;  
 risks related to cyber incidents that remain undetected for an extended period;  
 description of relevant insurance coverage;  
 compliance, regulatory or contractual obligations related to cyber risk;  
 certification to widely recognized standards; and how cyber risks and cyber incidents are reflected in financial statements.  
 The report should also discuss the scope and frequency of the Board's oversight of cyber risks which may include review of relevant systems, policies, and procedures,                  related to:  
• determining critical assets (e.g., customer information);  
• employee training on data security and privacy-related risks;  
• due diligence for third party vendors and potential acquisitions;  
• data breach and incident response plans;  
• minimization of data collection and retention; and  
• security policies and audit frequency

 Cigna                   Gender Pay Gap – 2019  
 WHEREAS: The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent of that of their male counterparts. The gap for African America and Latina women is                  60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059.  
 Mercer finds actively managing pay equity "is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to                  improved representation." Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, and Robeco Sam suggests more gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, "the                  business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling." Best practices include "tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps."  
 Regulatory risks associated with pay equity exist. The Paycheck Fairness Act, introduced in Congress, would improve company-level transparency and strengthen penalties for                  equal pay violations. California, Massachusetts, New York and Maryland have enacted significant changes to their equal pay laws.  
 In 2018 the United Kingdom required large businesses to provide annual gender pay gap reports. Cigna U.K. reported a 17 percent median pay gap and 38 percent median bonus                  pay gap between male and female employees. Women comprised 60.9 percent of the lower quartile of its employees but only 39 percent of the upper quartile.  
 Cigna does not report on the gender pay gap for its U.S. employees yet Payscale shows Cigna's U.S. male employee's median pay is $14,906 more than its female employees - a                  nearly 20 percent difference. Cigna male employee median bonus is $2442 more than its female employees – a 33 percent difference.  
 Leading large-cap companies across industry sectors including Apple, Starbucks and Bank of New York Mellon, among others, have publicly committed to pay equity and published                  the results of gender pay assessments.  
 With evidence linking pay equity to greater diversity and strong links between management diversity, financial performance and more robust decision-making, companies would                  be well served by understanding the equity attributes of their pay, at all levels of the corporation, by gender as well as other facets of diversity, such as race and ethnicity. Amid increasing regulatory and investor interest, it is                  apparent that companies should understand, manage, and report on pay equity to shareholders.  
 RESOLVED: Shareholders request that our company prepare a report (at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary and confidential information), identifying whether a gender                  pay gap exists among its employees, and if so, outline the steps being taken to reduce the gap. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has defined the gender pay gap as the difference between male and female earnings                  expressed as a percentage of male earnings.  
 Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess our company's strategy and performance would include the percentage pay gap between male and female employees                  (including base, bonus and equity compensation), a discussion of policies to address any gaps and quantitative reduction targets, and the methodology used to identify pay disparities.

In person.           Attend the Annual Meeting, or send a personal representative with a valid legal proxy. Please note that         you cannot vote using the notice of internet availability of proxy materials. The notice identifies the items of business and describes how to vote, but you cannot vote by marking the notice and returning it. How do I vote         if my Cigna shares are held by a bank, broker or custodian (including a Fidelity brokerage account)? If your shares are         held by a bank, broker or other custodian (commonly referred to as shares held "in street name"), the holder of your shares will provide you with a copy of this Proxy Statement, a voting instruction form and directions on how to provide voting         instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the internet or by telephone. Unless you provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any matter except for the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditors         (Proposal 3). To ensure that your shares are counted in each of the other matters, we encourage you to provide instructions on how to vote your shares. If you hold shares         in street name and want to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to ask your bank, broker or custodian to provide you with a valid legal proxy. You will need to bring the proxy with you to the Annual Meeting in order to vote. Please         note that if you request a legal proxy from your bank, broker or custodian, any previously executed proxy will be revoked and your vote will not be counted unless you vote in person at the Annual Meeting or appoint another valid legal proxy to vote         on your behalf.
