[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• THE PROXY CARD is the means by which you actually authorize another person to vote your shares in accordance with the instructions.  
[END TABLE]
Our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, mail, electronic mail or facsimile. We will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies, although we will not pay additional compensation to these individuals for soliciting proxies. We will request banks, brokers and other nominees holding shares for a beneficial owner to forward copies of the proxy materials to those beneficial owners and to request instructions for voting those shares. We will reimburse these banks, brokers and other nominees for their related reasonable expenses. The Company has retained Morrow Sodali, LLC and Saratoga Proxy Consulting, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $12,500 each, plus expenses.  
We are making this proxy statement, our 2018 Annual Review and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, available to stockholders for the first time on or about March 11, 2019. 
Who is entitled to vote at the meeting?
Holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2019, are entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the meeting. The proxy notice states the number of shares you are entitled to vote.
You may vote your shares at the meeting in person or by proxy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TO VOTE IN PERSON, you must attend the meeting, and then complete and submit the ballot provided at the meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee holder, you will receive instructions from the holder of record explaining how your shares may be voted.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING 
[END TABLE]
Even if you vote by means of the internet, telephone, or complete and return a proxy card, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by taking one of the following actions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• send written notice to Keith H. Williamson, our Secretary, at our address as set forth in the accompanying Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; 
• submit a new vote by means of the mail, internet or telephone; or 
• attend the meeting, notify our Secretary that you are present, and then vote by ballot. 
[END TABLE]
What do I need to do if I plan to attend the meeting in person? 
If you would like to attend the meeting, please bring evidence to the meeting that you own common stock, such as a stock certificate. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, please bring a recent brokerage statement or a letter from the nominee confirming your beneficial ownership of such shares. You must also bring a form of personal identification. 
What is the quorum requirement? 
At the close of business on February 22, 2019, there were 413,176,198 shares of our common stock outstanding, net of treasury shares. Our By-Laws require that a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on that date be represented, in person or by proxy, at the meeting in order to constitute the quorum we need to transact business. We will count abstentions and broker non-votes in determining whether a quorum exists. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. 
What vote is required to approve each proposal? 
Our By-Laws include a majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections, which are generally defined as elections in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Under the majority voting standard, in uncontested elections of directors, such as this election, each director must be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director by the shares represented and entitled to vote therefor at the meeting. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that director nominee. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, in this election, any director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "AGAINST" his or her election than "FOR" votes must tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors promptly following certification of the stockholder vote. The Nominating and Governance Committee is required to make a recommendation to the Board of Directors with respect to any such tendered resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation within 90 days from the certification of the vote and will publicly disclose its decision, including an explanation of its decision. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as a vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" a director nominee's election and thus will have no effect in determining whether a director nominee has received a majority of the votes cast.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting is necessary to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, to approve on an advisory non-binding basis, the Company's executive compensation, and to consider the stockholder proposal on political spending disclosures. Abstentions and broker non-votes with respect to each of these proposals will not be considered as votes cast with respect to the matter and thus will have no effect on the vote.
Will other matters be considered at the meeting?
Our Board of Directors is not aware of any matters that are expected to come before the meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement. If any other matter should properly come before the meeting, the persons appointed as proxies by the Board of Directors intend to vote the proxies in accordance with their best judgment.
The Chairperson of the meeting may refuse to allow the transaction of any business not presented beforehand, or to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made, in compliance with the procedures set forth in our By-Laws.

Nominees and Continuing Directors 
[END TABLE]
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Board is to be divided into three classes serving for staggered three-year terms. Under our By-Laws, our Board of Directors has the authority to fix the number of directors, provided that the Board must have between five and eleven members. The first proposal on the agenda for the meeting is the election of three nominees to serve as Class III Directors for three-year terms beginning at the meeting and ending at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
No director, including any director standing for election, or any associate of a director, is a party adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries in any material proceeding or has any material interest adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries. No director, including any director standing for election, is related by blood, marriage or adoption to any other director or any executive officer.
The Board has nominated Orlando Ayala, John R. Roberts, and Tommy G. Thompson for re-election to the Board. We expect that Mr. Ayala, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Thompson will be able to serve if elected. If any of them are not able to serve, proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee or nominees. 
The Board believes the election of these three nominees is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders and recommends a vote "FOR" the election of the three nominees.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management 
[END TABLE]
We believe that good corporate governance is important to ensure that we are managed for the long-term benefit of our stockholders. We also recognize the connection between good corporate governance and our ability to create and sustain value for our stockholders. Our Ethics and Compliance Program provides methods by which we further enhance operations, safeguard against fraud and abuse and help ensure that our values are reflected in everything we do. We have also reviewed and believe we are in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Our Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines addressing, among other things, director qualifications and responsibilities, duties of key Board Committees, director compensation and management succession. A current copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is posted on our website, www.centene.com. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Business Ethics and Code of Conduct Policy (the Policy) which is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company, including the Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. While no policy can replace the thoughtful behavior of an ethical director, officer or employee, we believe the Policy will, among other things, focus our Board and management on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance for recognizing and responding to ethical issues, provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct and generally help foster a culture of honesty and accountability. Any amendment to, or waiver of, the Policy involving a director or executive officer may only be made by the Board or a committee of the Board. A current copy of the Policy is posted on our website, www.centene.com. Any future amendments of the Policy will be promptly disclosed on our website.
Our policy concerning pre-approval of related party transactions is incorporated into the provisions of the Policy.  As part of the Policy, our directors, officers and employees are responsible for disclosing any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest to the Senior Vice President of Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk Management of the Company or the Board of Directors, in the case of an executive officer or director, who shall be responsible for determining whether such transaction or relationship constitutes a conflict of interest.
The Board of Directors oversees execution of the Company's enterprise risk management (ERM) framework with assistance provided by Board Committees. This oversight is enabled by quarterly risk reporting from executive management. These reports are designed to provide visibility into the identification, assessment, monitoring and management of critical risks, including strategic, operational, financial, compensation, regulatory, compliance, investment, information security and other risks. In addition, the Board and its committees are informed of emerging risks and opportunities which could impact the Company's risk profile. This information is combined with other data to evaluate the Company's performance in relation to tolerance levels established in Centene's risk appetite framework on a quarterly basis. Management is responsible for executing day-to-day risk activities, and ensuring that ERM is integrated with strategic decision-making and financial budgeting processes. 
As noted above, the Board uses its Committees to assist in its risk oversight function:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Audit Committee assists in the oversight of our financial and reporting risks, disclosure risk and procedures, business ethics and conduct risks, investment risk, and risk assessment and management policies. The Company's Senior Vice President of Internal Audit, Compliance & Risk Management, who reports to the Audit Committee and CEO, assists the Company in identifying and evaluating risk management controls and methodologies to address risks and provides reports to the Audit Committee quarterly. The Audit Committee meets privately with representatives from the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and the Company's Senior Vice President of Internal Audit, Compliance & Risk Management. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Compensation Committee assists in the oversight of risks associated with our compensation plans and policies. Please see the discussion in the "Compensation Discussion & Analysis," or "CD&A," under the heading "Risk Disclosure" for a discussion of elements intended to mitigate excessive risk taking by our employees.

Our Board of Directors believes that supporting an inclusive and respectful work environment through training, education and community engagement activities is important to attract and retain a talented workforce. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines make clear that we are committed to a policy of inclusiveness which includes actively identifying and recruiting diverse candidates, including women, veterans, people with disabilities, and minorities, as part of the process for hiring employees and selecting new Board members. Women constitute over 30 percent of the executive team, and over 50 percent of employees at the director level or above are women. Furthermore, nearly 40 percent of the Company's leadership identify as Asian, African American or Hispanic.

We encourage our Board members, senior executives, and employees to become actively involved with organizations making a positive impact on communities. Our efforts include the intentional placement of service centers and other facilities in economically disadvantaged locations such as Ferguson, Missouri and Tyler, Texas, as well as a commitment to supplier diversity. Consistent with our local approach model, we often recruit individuals from local communities to serve as directors on the governing boards of our regulated health plan subsidiaries. Of the individuals serving in this capacity at the start of 2019, nearly one-third of the directors were women and nearly 40% were African American, Hispanic, or Asian. In addition to seeking diversity in its external directors, Centene has developed new initiatives to foster the inclusion of diverse perspectives within our workforce. Centene currently has five employee inclusion groups, covering veterans, women, LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), and all other employees within the spectrum of gender and sexuality) individuals, individuals with disabilities, and individuals with diverse multicultural backgrounds. Over 4,000 Centene employees are members of at least one inclusion group.
As a company that believes in transforming the health of communities, Centene's focus on environmental performance and sustainability is a large part of its day-to-day business operations. Our global headquarters is LEED Gold Certified and features vegetated green roof areas which reduce stormwater runoff while decreasing energy consumption and reducing the heat island effect. As Centene expands its geographic footprint across the U.S., the buildings that house our various operations also reflect our commitment to minimizing the impact on the environment. Our secondary data center, located in California, meets the state's Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards and our new Sacramento campus scheduled to open in 2020 is being built to LEED certification standards. Sustainability efforts regarding site construction focus on minimizing environmental damage caused by construction. Centene understands that sound environmental policy and practices have a positive business impact and promote the Company's commitment to helping people live healthier lives.

PROPOSAL ONE: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
The Board currently combines the role of Chairman of the Board with the role of CEO, coupled with a Presiding Director position to further strengthen the governance structure. The Board believes this provides an efficient and effective leadership model for the Company. Combining the Chairman and CEO roles fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making, and alignment on corporate strategy. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure. To ensure effective independent oversight, the Board has adopted a number of governance practices, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a strong, independent, clearly-defined Presiding Director role; 
• executive sessions of the independent directors in connection with every Board meeting; and 
• annual performance evaluations of the Chairman and CEO by the independent directors. 
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors has appointed Robert K. Ditmore "Presiding Director" to preside at all executive sessions of "non-management" directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE. The Presiding Director's role includes leading the Board's processes for selecting and evaluating the CEO and presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to conduct an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. The Nominating and Governance Committee receives comments from all directors and reports annually to the Board with an assessment of the Board's performance. This is discussed with the full Board following the end of each fiscal year. The assessment focuses on the Board's contribution to the Company and specifically focuses on areas in which the Board or management believes that the Board could improve.
[BEGIN TABLE]

Compensation Committee     
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee oversees our activities in the area of compensation and benefits (generally with regard to all employees and specifically with regard to our Named Executive Officers, or NEOs, identified in the Summary Compensation Table, as well as other officers) and reviews and makes recommendations concerning compensation-related matters to be submitted to the Board and/or stockholders for approval. The Board has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee is "independent," as defined under the rules of the NYSE. The Compensation Committee's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluating compensation policies and practices to determine if they may be influencing employees to take excessive risks; 
• annually reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to our CEO's compensation; 
• reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to our CEO's compensation; 
• reviewing and approving, or making recommendations to the Board, with respect to the compensation of our other executive officers; 
• overseeing an evaluation of our senior executives; 
• overseeing and administering our equity incentive plans; and 
• reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to director compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Members of management assist the Compensation Committee in its responsibilities by providing recommendations for the Compensation Committee's approval concerning the design of our compensation program for our executive officers other than our CEO, including our NEOs, as well as recommended award levels. The design of our compensation program for our CEO is recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board without any approval of the Chairman, who is the Company's CEO. 
The Compensation Committee considered information and data regarding executive compensation supplied by management and by Exequity, LLP, compensation consultants that were engaged directly by the Compensation Committee to provide advice with respect to base salaries, bonus targets and long-term incentives. The consultants analyzed the compensation levels of the NEOs of the industry peer group developed by Exequity, LLP for the most recently completed fiscal year. As discussed under the CD&A, the Compensation Committee considered this information, along with a variety of other factors, in reviewing executive compensation in 2018. 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed the independence of Exequity, LLP in light of SEC rules and NYSE listing standards, including the following factors: (1) other services provided to us by the consulting firm; (2) fees paid by us as a percentage of consulting firm's total revenue; (3) policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between the compensation consultant and a member of the Compensation Committee; (5) any company stock owned by the compensation consultant; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the senior advisor. The Compensation Committee discussed these considerations and concluded that the compensation consultant's work for the committee does not raise any conflict of interest.
The Compensation Committee delegates to management the authority to grant certain stock options and restricted stock units under the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. Our CEO is authorized to issue awards (other than to himself) of up to 60,000 shares to any newly hired executive and up to 24,000 shares to any one person during a calendar year, and is required to report any such grants to the Compensation Committee at the following Compensation Committee meeting. The delegation of authority may be terminated by the Compensation Committee at any time and for any reason. All internal promotions and equity grants to any "Executive Officer" (as defined by Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) require Compensation Committee approval.

Director Candidates  
[END TABLE]
The process followed by the Nominating and Governance Committee to identify and evaluate Director candidates includes requests to Board members and others for recommendations, meetings from time to time to evaluate biographical information and background material relating to potential candidates and interviews of selected candidates by members of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board. 
In considering whether to recommend any particular candidate for inclusion in the Board's slate of recommended director nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee will apply the criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include the candidate's integrity, business acumen, knowledge of our business and industry, age, experience, diligence, conflicts of interest and the ability to act in the interests of all stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is a prerequisite for each prospective nominee. We believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of our directors, considered as a group, should provide a composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow the Board to fulfill its responsibilities.
We believe that it is important that our directors represent and understand the diverse populations that we serve. Indeed, Board membership should reflect diversity in its broadest sense, including persons diverse in background, geography, perspective, gender, and ethnicity. The Board is particularly interested in maintaining a mix that includes the following backgrounds: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Public company governance 
• Healthcare 
• Service and insurance industry 
• Companies with revenues greater than $1 billion 
• Public accounting 
• Community involvement

The Board recognizes, however, the importance of planning for the succession of Board leadership and of bringing on new members.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Communicating with Independent Directors 
[END TABLE]
The Board will give appropriate attention to written communications that are submitted by stockholders and other interested parties and will respond as appropriate. The Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee, with the assistance of our CEO, is primarily responsible for monitoring communications from stockholders and other interested parties and for providing copies or summaries to the other directors as he or she considers appropriate. Under procedures approved by a majority of the independent directors, communications are forwarded to all directors if they relate to important substantive matters and include suggestions or comments considered to be important for the directors to know.  
Stockholders and interested parties who wish to send communications on any topic to the Board should address such communications to Board of Directors c/o Corporate Secretary, Centene Corporation, 7700 Forsyth Boulevard, St. Louis, Missouri 63105.

Non-employee directors currently receive a quarterly retainer fee of $31,250, provided that the director elects to receive 100% of the fee in Company stock and defers settlement of the fee until retirement or termination of the Board under the Company's Non-Employee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan. Directors not making this election receive a quarterly cash retainer fee of $25,000. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee receives a quarterly fee of $7,500, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee receives a quarterly fee of $5,000, and the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee, Government and Regulatory Affairs Committee, and Technology Committee each receives a quarterly fee of $3,750.

Expense recognized in conjunction with the deferred stock election is included in the "Stock Awards" column in the Director Compensation Table above.
The Board receives additional variable compensation dependent on the number of meetings held annually. Once the number of full Board of Director meetings held exceeds six, non-employee directors receive $2,000 per meeting, not to exceed $20,000 annually.

As part of non-employee director compensation and to recognize each member's stock holding requirement of 40,000 shares, each director receives an annual stock grant valued at $200,000 based on first quarter average stock price prior to the grant. In April 2018, each member of the Board received a grant of 3,850 restricted shares of our common stock (target value of $200,000). The restricted shares vest on the April 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, subject to meeting Board of Director meeting attendance conditions.

PROPOSAL TWO: ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal Two: Advisory Resolution to Approve Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved the Company's executive compensation. Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are again holding an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation, as described in this Proxy Statement (commonly referred to as "say-on-pay"). In accordance with the results of the vote we conducted at the 2017 Annual Meeting on the frequency of say-on-pay votes, we present a say-on-pay vote every year. 
We encourage stockholders to review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Proxy Statement. Our executive compensation program has been designed to implement the Company's compensation philosophy of paying for performance by making decisions based on promoting the Company's corporate mission statement and creating long-term stockholder value. As discussed in Section 3 of CD&A, the following principles guide the Company's compensation philosophy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay for Performance; 
• Create Long-Term Stockholder Value;  
• Foster a Culture of Risk Management and Compliance; and 
• Attract and Retain Top Executive Talent. 
[END TABLE]
This philosophy is evidenced by the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide a significant part of executive compensation in the form of at-risk annual incentive and long-term incentive compensation; for example, we have withheld or reduced payments under our incentive programs when financial, quality or compliance measures have not been fully achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual incentive and long-term incentive opportunities are substantially based on corporate financial measures closely correlated with achieving long-term stockholder value, such as earnings per share, revenue growth targets, pre-tax operating margins and total shareholder return. Annual incentive opportunities are also based on meeting individual goals around compliance, quality and operational excellence. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide a mix of short-term, long-term, cash and non-cash compensation that we believe allows us to strike a balance between offering competitive executive compensation packages, motivating our executives without fostering excessive risk-taking and linking Executive Officer compensation with the creation of long-term stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors strongly endorses the Company's executive compensation program and recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of those NEOs listed in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular and narrative disclosure included herein under "Information about Executive Compensation."
Centene Corporation   18
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 NOTICE OF MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT 
PROPOSAL TWO: ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
Because the vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and neither the Board of Directors nor the Compensation Committee will be required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. The Compensation Committee strongly considers the views of the Company's stockholders when making compensation decisions. Additionally, the Compensation Committee monitors the results of the annual advisory "say-on-pay" proposal and incorporates such results as one of many factors considered in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities.

  Proposal Three: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[END TABLE]
KPMG LLP audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent external audit firm retained to audit our financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year, and we are asking stockholders to ratify this appointment. KPMG LLP has been retained as our external auditor continuously since 2005. Stockholder ratification of this selection is not required by our By-Laws or other applicable legal requirements. Our Board of Directors is, however, submitting the selection of KPMG LLP to stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event that stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will consider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee believes that a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
We expect that representatives of KPMG LLP will be present at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to answer appropriate questions. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting is being sought to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year. The Committee believes the continued retention of KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
The following table discloses the aggregate fees for services related to 2018 and 2017 by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm ($ in thousands): 
[BEGIN TABLE]

2018 2017 
Audit Fees $11,400 $9,437 
Audit-Related Fees 340 230 
Tax Fees 55 50 
[END TABLE]
Audit-related fees in 2018 and 2017 consist primarily of fees for operational control reviews. The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with our retention of KPMG LLP. Tax fees included in the table above relate to tax planning associated with the expansion of our corporate headquarters.
In order to ensure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent audit firm. The Committee ensures that the mandated rotation of KPMG LLP's personnel occurs routinely and is directly involved in the selection of KPMG LLP's lead engagement partner.
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the approval of all audit, audit-related, tax and other services that are to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. This policy generally provides that the Company will not engage its independent registered public accounting firm to render audit, audit-related, tax or other services unless the service is specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the engagement is entered into pursuant to one of the pre-approval procedures described below.

PROPOSAL FOUR: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL ON POLITICAL SPENDING DISCLOSURES 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal Four: Stockholder Proposal on Political Spending Disclosures 
[END TABLE]
In November 2018, the Company received correspondence from Friends Fiduciary Corporation, beneficial owner of Centene common stock, regarding a proposal on political spending disclosures for consideration at the meeting as described below. 
Friends Fiduciary Corporation, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 1904, Philadelphia, PA 19103, beneficial owners of no less than 1,280 shares of Centene common stock as of November 8, 2018, intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Stockholder Statement Regarding Proposal on Political Spending Disclosures 
[END TABLE]
Centene Corporation Political Disclosure Shareholder Resolution
Resolved, that the shareholders of Centene Corporation ("Centene" or "Company") hereby request that the Company provide a report, updated semiannually, disclosing the Company's:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Policies and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or indirect) to (a) participate or intervene in any campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, or (b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum. 
2. Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner described in section 1 above, including: 
a. The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and b. The title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision-making. 
[END TABLE]
The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.
Supporting Statement 
As long-term shareholders of Centene, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates.
Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said "[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages."
Publicly available records show Centene has contributed at least $12,500,000 in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle (CQMoneyLine: http://moneyline.cq.com; National institute on Money in State Politics: http://www.followthemoney.org).
However, relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including Express Scripts Holding Company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., and Humana Inc., which present this information on their websites.
The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.

PROPOSAL FOUR: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL ON POLITICAL SPENDING DISCLOSURES 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal on Political Spending Disclosures 
[END TABLE]
The Company believes it is necessary and appropriate to participate in the political process to further the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company's operations are comprehensively regulated at local, state, and federal levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and proposed changes to these laws, rules and regulations can have a significant effect on the Company's operating results and stockholder value. Permitted political contributions and memberships in trade associations play an important role in the Company's public policy engagement efforts. The Company believes its current practices, described below, provide ample transparency and accountability with respect to the Company's political spending.
Corporations are prohibited under federal and many state laws from making direct or indirect contributions to candidates or political parties. Where permitted by law, the Company may make contributions with respect to state and local ballot questions and referenda that have a direct impact on the Company's business (such as those dealing with Medicaid expansion). The Company is committed to complying with all applicable federal, state and local laws in connection with the Company's political spending. The Company has a political action committee, the Centene Corporation Political Action Committee (the PAC). All of the contributions made by the PAC are derived from voluntary employee contributions; the Company makes no contributions. The Company does, however, pay the solicitation and administrative expenses of the PAC, which are minimal, as permitted by law. All political contributions made by the Company and/or the PAC must comply with all applicable laws and regulations and adhere to the Company's Political Contributions Policy and the Company's Business Ethics and Code of Conduct, copies of which are available on the Company's website.
The Company's political contributions are governed by extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including detailed disclosure requirements, including requirements to file reports with appropriate agencies on lobbying-related activities and expenditures. For example, certain information with respect to contributions made by the PAC is publicly available at the Federal Election Commission's website at http://fec.gov/. We do not believe that the additional information requested by the proposal will add significant value for shareholders.
To the extent the proposal would cover payments to tax exempt organizations that in turn may engage in political activity, it should be noted that Centene belongs to many trade associations. While the Company does not always share or agree with all of the views espoused by such organizations, the Company believes they are often helpful for the purpose of building a consensus among organizations with similar interests and advocating in favor of those interests. The Company regularly reviews the costs and benefits of its memberships in trade associations. In addition, trade associations are subject to public disclosure obligations with respect to their lobbying and political contributions and expenditures. 
The Company is committed to being upstanding and accountable when participating in the political process. However, given the existing system of reporting and accountability already in place for the Company, the detailed report requested by the proposal would require significant time and expense with no added benefit to stockholders. If adopted, it could also result in a competitive disadvantage for the Company. We believe that any additional political contribution reporting requirements that go beyond those required under existing law should be applicable to all participants engaged in the political process. The Board believes that the time and expense involved in preparing the detailed report requested by the proposal could be better utilized to move the Company's business forward and, consequently, does not support the proposal.
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "AGAINST" the proposal requesting political spending disclosures.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit Committee Report 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Company's Board of Directors. The charter outlines the Audit Committee's duties and responsibilities. The Audit Committee reviews the charter annually and works with the Board of Directors to amend the charter, as necessary, based on the Audit Committee's evolving responsibilities. The Audit Committee charter is available on the Company's website at investors.centene.com/corporate-governance.
The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors consists of four non-employee directors who are independent under the rules of the NYSE, the rules of the SEC and the Company's Standards for Director Independence. Three of the Audit Committee members are considered Audit Committee Financial Experts as defined by the SEC and all are financially literate under the applicable NYSE rules. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of the accounting and financial reporting process of the Company. Specifically, the Audit Committee has responsibility for providing independent objective oversight of the accounting and financial reporting process of the Company, selecting and evaluating the independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit Committee and oversees the performance of the Company's internal audit function.
Management has the primary responsibility for the preparation of the Company's financial statements and the overall reporting process, for maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and, with the assistance of the Company's internal auditors, for assessing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(the PCAOB), expressing an opinion as to the conformity of the financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and auditing management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2005. 
Management represented to the Audit Committee that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee met and held discussions with management and KPMG LLP to review and discuss the financial statements and the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP the firm's judgments as to the quality and the acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and such other matters as are required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees. KPMG LLP also provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP their independence with respect to the Company, including a review of audit and non-audit fees and services and concluded that KPMG LLP is independent.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for reviewing the services performed by KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee has the sole authority to select, evaluate and replace the outside auditors. The Audit Committee discusses the overall scope of the annual audit, the proposed audit fee, and annually evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of KPMG LLP as independent registered public accountants and the performance of its lead audit partner. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their respective examinations, the evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of the Company's accounting.

SECTION 1 - Executive Summary 
[END TABLE]
We are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.  
In July 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc. d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care) in a transaction valued at $3.6 billion. The Fidelis Care acquisition expanded the Company's scale and presence to New York State.
On December 12, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of Centene's common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018. All share, per share and stock price information presented in this proxy statement has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split.
2018 was another successful year for the Company. Growth was driven by the Fidelis Care and other acquisitions, increased membership in our Health Insurance Marketplace business, as well as geographic and product expansions that led to strong financial results. Our performance is summarized as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total revenues of $60.1 billion, an increase of 24% over 2017. 
• Diluted EPS of $2.26, a decrease of 3% over 2017, which reflects $0.81 per diluted share of acquisition related expenses incurred in 2018 primarily related to the Fidelis Care acquisition. 
• Adjusted Diluted EPS of $3.54, an increase of 40% over 2017. 
• Operating cash flows of $1.2 billion. 
• Return on Equity of 10% in 2018, and a three year average of 12%. 
• Return on Assets of 3% in 2018, and a three year average of 4%. 
• Return on Invested Capital of 6% in 2018, and a three year average of 7%. 
• Stock price return of 14% in 2018. 
[END TABLE]
Overall, our three-year Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) have been:

SECTION 2 - 2018 Compensation Decisions 
Alignment of Pay and Performance      
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Company delivered revenue and adjusted EPS growth, which are key to our strategy to promote long-term shareholder value in a competitive business environment. Our revenues increased 24% over 2017, with a 38% three-year compound annual growth rate. The Company also achieved three-year compound annual growth rates of 16% and 31% for Diluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS, respectively. When reviewing the NEOs' compensation, the Compensation Committee considered the value of our senior executives, who are some of the most talented in our industry. While our NEOs' total incentive compensation opportunities may be high, the amounts they ultimately realize are contingent on their ability to achieve our growth and profitability objectives and create sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. When reviewing the NEOs' compensation with our independent executive compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee considered these aspects in conjunction with our executive compensation program of recognizing pay for performance through the following three primary components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Pay + Cash Awards Under Our Annual Incentive Plan + Long-Term Incentives 
Performance-Based RSUs Time-Based RSUs Cash LTIP
Performance-Based RSUs Time-Based RSUs Cash LTIP
Performance-Based RSUs Time-Based RSUs Cash LTIP
[END TABLE]
The Company's 2018 performance included the well-executed acquisition of Fidelis Care, which was key to our strategic plan for continued high growth and profitability. The Board of Directors acknowledged this success and also the importance of our CEO's leadership, which includes 22 years of tenure in which he has fostered sustainable high growth and strong profitability. The Compensation Committee, together with our independent executive compensation consultant, analyzed our CEO's total historical compensation. Based on their review, they determined that total compensation in 2018 continues to mirror the overall growth in our Total Shareholder Return (TSR), revenue and Adjusted Diluted EPS over the last five years. Our CEO's total compensation alignment with these metrics is illustrated in the following graphs:

Pay Mix

Our pay for performance philosophy can be further depicted by the following graph, which represents our total compensation mix. The graph below illustrates the 2018 values contained in the Summary Compensation Table as percentages of total compensation. The values in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table have been excluded from this illustration.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Target Pay Review     
[END TABLE]
Consistent with our compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee reviewed the target compensation and respective market data of two groups: general industry (GI) and our healthcare industry peer group (HCI). The review of the data indicated that Mr. Neidorff's total target 2018 compensation was within the 50th percentile and 75th percentile of the GI peer group, with data regressed to $70 billion in revenue. Our projected total revenues fall within this regression range.  
While recognizing that Mr. Neidorff's total target compensation is above the 75th percentile of the HCI peer group, the Compensation Committee determined that his target pay appropriately reflects the need for an experienced, seasoned CEO in a high-growth company. The Compensation Committee also recognized Mr. Neidorff's more than 20 years of experience as a CEO; his ability to grow the revenue of Centene during his tenure from approximately $300 million in 2001, at the Company's initial public offering, to over $60 billion in 2018; and his execution of transforming the healthcare landscape in the United States, in determining his compensation amount. The HCI peer group and GI peer group are discussed in further detail under Section 3 of the CD&A under the headings "Healthcare Industry Peer Group" and "General Industry Group," respectively. 
A similar analysis of peer data sets is performed of the other NEOs' compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of each individual and aligns compensation based on these results.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Salaries     
[END TABLE]
In December 2017, the Compensation Committee evaluated 2018 base salaries and took into account the Company's 2018 estimated revenue of approximately $60 billion. In 2018, our NEOs' base salaries were compared to market data and, on average, the base salaries for 2018 approximated the 50th percentile of the HCI peer group and the GI peer group. Adjustments to base salaries are determined based on merit and market data.

[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 NOTICE OF MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT 
INFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
The NEOs were paid competitive base salaries determined by the evaluation of multiple factors: business results for the prior year, individual performance, as well as the market value for each specific job. Since Centene is a pay for performance company, only 6% of the CEO's compensation is comprised of base salary and, on average, only 11% of the other NEOs' compensation is comprised of base salary.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annual Cash Incentive Plan      
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee assigned an annual cash incentive plan target opportunity of 150% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the other NEOs based on a review of industry data, as discussed in Section 3: Compensation Philosophy. The Compensation Committee rewards NEOs with an annual cash incentive bonus if the Company achieves its EPS objective. The Committee assesses how each NEO contributed to achieving this EPS objective and other pre-determined objectives approved by the Compensation Committee earlier in the year. For 2018, the Committee determined that 70% of the incentive target would be aligned with the Adjusted Diluted EPS target, and the remaining 30% would be aligned with individual performance objectives based on the following factors:
• Compliance
• Quality
• People and Talent
• Enterprise Transformation
• Operational Goals
 The Compensation Committee follows a two-step process to determine the bonus earned each year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Achievement of EPS Objective. In early 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that if the Company reached its 2018 Adjusted Diluted EPS target of $3.38, then a bonus would be paid at target based on each NEO's contribution. Since the Company's 2018 Adjusted Diluted EPS was $3.54, the Compensation Committee interpolated the results and funded the incentive pool for executives at 184% of target.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. Evaluation of Individual Performance. In addition, based on input from management, the Compensation Committee assessed each NEO's individual performance against pre-determined goals. If the individual performance goals were met, exceeded or not met, then the individual performance component of the annual cash incentive equaled, exceeded or was less than the target. A summary of each NEO's individual performance, along with their total 2018 Annual Cash Incentive follows.

INFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
Based on the Company meeting its Adjusted Diluted EPS goal, increasing pre-tax income, increasing total revenues to $60.1 billion, and the closing and integration of the Fidelis Care acquisition, the Compensation Committee reviewed the CEO's performance during 2018 and recommended to the Board of Directors that an annual bonus of $4.5 million be awarded to Mr. Neidorff. The bonus, which was 200% of his target, is representative of the Company's performance and Mr. Neidorff's personal performance for the year. In addition, other NEOs received an annual bonus ranging from 172% - 200% of target. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Awards 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee granted long-term incentives to our NEOs in December 2018 based on a review of industry data, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PSUs) (60% of equity granted) - The target metrics for the 2019 - 2021 performance period are pre-tax margin (60% weight) and compound annual revenue growth (40% weight). Threshold, target and maximum metric achievement will result in 50%, 100% or 200% attainment of each metric, respectively. If earned, PSUs will vest in February 2022. 
• Service-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) (40% of equity granted) - One-third vest annually based on service to the Company. 
• Cash Long-term Incentive Plan (Cash LTIP) - The target metrics include the performance criteria above for the three-year performance period (2019 - 2021) as well as a relative Total Shareholder Return objective. Threshold, target and maximum metric achievement will result in 50%, 100% or 200% attainment of each metric, respectively. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has the discretion to evaluate the metrics on an "as adjusted" basis, and exclude certain one-time acquisition related transaction costs and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium in evaluating the pre-tax margin metric criteria.

SECTION 3 - Compensation Philosophy 
[END TABLE]
The following principles guide the Company's compensation philosophy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay for Performance - Our overall compensation philosophy is to pay for performance. Executive compensation is directly linked to performance and the achievement of both Company and individual goals.  Superior performance and the achievement of goals results in higher compensation. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Create Long-Term Stockholder Value - Both performance-based and service-based stock and cash awards with meaningful retention requirements are used to encourage sustained stockholder value creation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Foster a Culture of Risk Management and Compliance - A portion of NEO compensation is based on meeting individual goals that align with our corporate mission statement and promote a culture of compliance with rules, regulations and the Company's vision and values and rewarding those who mitigate business risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and Retain Top Executive Talent - We offer competitive pay to attract, motivate and retain industry executives with the skills and experience to drive superior long-term Company performance in a high growth company.  
Results of the April 2018 "Say-on-Pay" Vote 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee monitors the results of the annual advisory "say-on-pay" proposal and considers such results as one of many factors in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. At our April 2018 Annual Meeting, approximately 88% of our stockholders voted to approve our 2017 executive compensation program.  
Stockholders expressed a wide variety of views about executive compensation. We valued the insights we received from our stockholders as we reached out to gain a more thorough understanding of their comments. As a result of feedback from our stockholders in prior years, the Compensation Committee previously made key changes, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligned 70% of each NEO's annual incentive award to Adjusted Diluted EPS; 
• Changed the performance period applicable to PSUs from one-year to three-years; and 
• Changed the mix of PSUs and RSUs for executives from a 50/50% split to a 60/40% split, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, as a result of feedback received from our stockholders, we have provided enhanced disclosures in our proxy around quality goals and measures and how the NEOs' compensation is aligned with those metrics.
We actively seek input from stockholders on compensation and governance matters and are always open to new ideas. We have also received some feedback that our equity grants as a percent of outstanding shares, which has averaged around 1.0% over the past few years, is higher than some investors prefer. Most recently, our run rate has trended around 0.7%. While we recognize that our historical run rate is higher than some of our competitors, we believe that providing broader ownership participation below senior leaders is important in driving company performance, retaining key talent, and driving shareholder value.

Overview of the Compensation Program  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee establishes and administers the executive compensation philosophy and program and assists the Board of Directors in the development and oversight of all aspects of executive compensation. Presented in the table below are highlights of our compensation practices:
[BEGIN TABLE]
What We Do 
ü Pay for Performance A significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is tied to performance with clearly articulated financial and performance goals. ü Annual Compensation Risk Assessment We regularly analyze risks related to our compensation program and we conduct broad risk assessments. 
ü  Competitive Compensation Each component of the NEOs' annual total direct compensation is generally targeted around the 50th percentile for both the HCI peer group and the GI peer group. ü  Stock Ownership Requirements We maintain rigorous stock ownership requirements for our directors, executives and other members of senior management. Our CEO's requirement is 5x annual base pay; other NEOs' requirements are 2.5x annual base pay. 
ü  Competitive Compensation Each component of the NEOs' annual total direct compensation is generally targeted around the 50th percentile for both the HCI peer group and the GI peer group. ü  Stock Ownership Requirements We maintain rigorous stock ownership requirements for our directors, executives and other members of senior management. Our CEO's requirement is 5x annual base pay; other NEOs' requirements are 2.5x annual base pay. 
ü  Equity Grants Reward Long-Term Future Performance PSU grants vest at the end of the three-year period based on two, three-year performance metrics.  ü  Clawbacks We can recover performance-based cash and equity incentive compensation paid to executives in various circumstances.  
ü Formula Based Annual Incentive Plan Awards under the Annual Cash Incentive plan are formula based. ü Independent Compensation Consultant The Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant to advise the committee on executive compensation matters. 
ü Tally Sheets Tally sheets and wealth accumulation analyses for each NEO are reviewed annually before making compensation decisions.     
What We Don't Do 
X Excessive Risk-Taking in Our Compensation Programs The long-term incentive plans use multiple performance measures, capped payouts and other features intended to minimize the incentive to take overly risky actions. X No Hedging or Pledging Directors and executives are prohibited from hedging, pledging or engaging in any derivatives trading with respect to Company stock. 
X No Tax Gross-ups There are no tax "gross-ups" for perquisites or excise tax gross-ups in the event of a change of control related termination. X No Backdating or Repricing of Stock Options Stock options are never backdated or issued with below-market exercise prices. Re-pricing of stock options without stockholder approval is expressly prohibited. 
X No Single-Trigger Employment Agreements Any cash payments in executive employment agreements are subject to a "double-trigger" change in control condition.

Competitive Pay Philosophy 
[END TABLE]
Centene must leverage its compensation and benefit programs to attract the best talent to compete and achieve aggressive operating objectives. Therefore, Centene views both private equity firms and competitors with larger revenue bases as significant competition for talent. Centene also recognizes that our Company is a source for these firms and competitors to recruit talent if the appropriate compensation programs are not in place at Centene.  
For the components of target total compensation, the Compensation Committee's competitive objectives are for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salaries to approximate the 50th percentile of similarly-sized organizations, based on revenues. The 50th percentile will be targeted in most instances; however, up to the 75th percentile or higher may be considered when retaining key employees and recruiting talent from significantly larger companies and private equity firms or when the experience of the executive dictates a higher base salary; 
• annual bonus targets to approximate the 50th percentile of similarly-sized organizations; and 
• long-term incentive targets to approximate the 50th percentile of similarly-sized organizations. 
[END TABLE]
The goal of these objectives is that based on individual performance, actual total compensation will fall at the 50th percentile of total market based compensation for both the HCI peer group and the GI peer group for expected performance and between the 50th and 75th percentile based on extraordinary performance.  Exceptions are sometimes made when an individual's experience and impact warrant it, as is the case for our CEO. 
In order to achieve these objectives, the Compensation Committee establishes target, market-based total compensation levels (e.g., base salary, annual bonus target and long-term incentives) from market data from two different peer groups.
[BEGIN TABLE]
A. Healthcare Industry Peer Group 
[END TABLE]
Using the Standard and Poor's Global Industry Classification System (GICS) codes and other relevant industry parameters, Exequity, LLP analyzed the managed care industry and determined there are four key segments in the industry:

        Tenet Healthcare Corp. 
B. General Industry Group 
[END TABLE]
Since there is a market for executive talent both within and outside our industry, we also benchmark against the general industry. Therefore, the market data the Compensation Committee utilizes includes not only the managed healthcare industry peer group of 14 companies, but also a general industry peer group of approximately 400 companies derived from the Willis Towers Watson's Compensation Database (CDB). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Benchmarking Methodology  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee engaged Exequity, LLP, to gather, analyze and summarize the market data from the Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Database for the CEO and the other four NEOs. 
For this analysis, which is utilized in determining December equity grant awards and compensation for the forthcoming year, including base salaries, annual cash incentive targets and cash LTIP targets, we size adjust both the healthcare and general industry peer data to be in line with our forecasted revenues for the upcoming year. The Compensation Committee also reviews data adjusted to reflect the estimated revenues over the next one to three years, based on our growth pattern combined with any proposed acquisitions. This data provides a more representative depiction of the overall competitive market for talent, as evidenced by several of our executives who came from companies outside of our industry.
 All elements of compensation are valued and reviewed in evaluating the relative competitiveness of our compensation practices against both market data and the Compensation Committee's competitive objectives. In addition, the Compensation Committee annually reviews a tally sheet for each NEO, which includes the current value of all outstanding equity-based awards, benefits and perquisites. The Compensation Committee uses the tally sheets to analyze each NEO's base salary, annual incentive target and long-term incentive opportunity in relation to the market and each component of compensation as a percentage of total compensation.

Base Salaries 
[END TABLE]
While reviewing market data to determine appropriate annual base salaries, the Compensation Committee also considers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the CEO's compensation recommendations for all other NEOs; 
• the scope of responsibility, experience, time in position and individual performance of each officer, including the CEO; 
• each executive's leadership performance and potential to enhance long-term stockholder value; and 
• internal equity. 
Annual Cash Incentive 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee rewards NEOs with an annual cash incentive bonus for achieving the Company's EPS objective. Annually, the committee assesses how each NEO contributed to achieving the EPS objective and other pre-determined objectives approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee follows a two-step process to determine the amount of bonus earned each year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. The Company must meet a specific EPS objective during the year before any payments may be made. If the Company does not meet its threshold performance, no payments are made. The Company has not reached its threshold EPS objective in certain years past and, accordingly, no annual bonuses were paid.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. In addition, each NEOs' individual performance is assessed by management and the Compensation Committee against the pre-determined objectives. If these pre-determined objectives were met, exceeded or not met, then the annual bonus could equal, exceed or be less than target, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
Individual awards under our bonus plan are approved by the Compensation Committee based primarily upon:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• business performance versus our business plan; 
• the effectiveness of each executive's leadership performance and potential to enhance long-term stockholder value; 
• targeted bonus amounts, which are based upon market data; and 
• the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer (for all NEOs other than the CEO).  
[END TABLE]
Overall, 70% of each award is aligned with the Adjusted Diluted EPS target, and the remaining 30% of each award is aligned with individual performance objectives. However, the Compensation Committee reserves the ability to exceed this amount for exceptional performance at its discretion, not to exceed a maximum award pool of 200% of target.

In 2019, we will continue to focus on long-term shareholder value through meeting our financial metrics but will also continue to emphasize the following factors in meeting our goals:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compliance & quality; 
• leadership; 
• diversified growth - domestic and international; 
• financial discipline with a focus on margin improvement; and, 
• operational excellence including successful integrations of acquisitions. 
[END TABLE]
As part of our Quality objectives, we have goals that are tied to key metrics such as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Star ratings; 
• National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accreditation; 
• Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures; and, 
• Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey results. 
Long-Term Incentives 
[END TABLE]
Our long-term incentive compensation is designed to attract and retain key executives, build an integrated management team, reward for innovation and appropriate risk-taking, balance short-term planning with long-term successes and align executive and stockholder interests. TSR, revenue growth, and pre-tax operating margin targets as well as competitive market practices are all used by the Compensation Committee in determining long-term incentives.  
These long-term incentives take the form of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSUs that are based on meeting pre-determined performance targets (pre-tax margin and revenue growth), vest at the end of the three-year performance period.  
• RSUs that vest over three years. 
• Cash LTIP that is based on meeting three-year relative TSR, pre-tax margin and revenue growth metrics. 
• Stock Options which are granted on a limited basis and vest over three years. 
[END TABLE]
Long-term incentives are provided both through equity (PSUs at 60% and RSUs at 40%) and cash, while ensuring that the maximum number of shares of common stock granted in any calendar year (excluding shares granted in connection with an acquisition) does not exceed a level associated with competitive practice. Excluding acquisitions, the Company does not annually grant equity compensation exceeding 2% of the outstanding shares of the Company. In recent years, the equity grants have averaged at approximately 1.0% of outstanding shares. Most recently, our run rate has trended around 0.7%. Due to the growth of the Company, the competitive nature of our business and the necessity of retaining key management level employees, equity grants can be awarded to levels below senior executives, including director and manager level employees. PSUs and RSUs are normally granted at the annual December Compensation Committee meeting, but may also be approved at other times for a promotion, extraordinary performance, a newly hired executive or as determined by the Compensation Committee.

Cash LTIP Award Performance Targets  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee utilizes the Cash LTIP, which is a three-year performance program, to complement the stock incentive plan, manage dilution and supplement the number of shares available under the Company's stock incentive plan. Each NEO is awarded a grant at the beginning of the three-year cycle based on the following targets:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chairman & CEO - 150% of Prior Year's Annual Salary 
• Other NEOs - 100% of Prior Year's Annual Salary 
[END TABLE]
Cash awards are paid annually, if earned, after completion of each three-year performance cycle, and targets are announced annually prior to the beginning of each three-year year performance cycle. 
The Compensation Committee sets performance targets at levels it believes to be rigorous and challenging. The performance criteria may include any of the metrics identified in the plan document. We believe the specific performance metrics related to the Cash LTIP plan and the range of awards related to the achievement of such measures are reflective of our overall business strategy and constitute confidential information. We believe disclosing such information would cause us competitive harm. The Compensation Committee may determine that the performance parameters used to measure the appropriate payout include or exclude items which are deemed extraordinary. These items include, but are not limited to, those stated in the plan document. 
In order for a NEO to earn a Cash LTIP payout, at least one of the following metric thresholds must be achieved: pre-tax margin percentage, revenue compound annual growth rate percentage or TSR relative to the HCI peer group. These metrics are applicable for the 2017 - 2019 cycle (awarded in December 2016), the 2018 - 2020 cycle (awarded in December 2017), and the 2019 - 2021 cycle (awarded in December 2018). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Other Benefits 
[END TABLE]
We provide our NEOs with a defined contribution 401(k) retirement program, which is the same program that is generally provided to all our employees. We also provide our NEOs with a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to make up for matching contributions that are capped by compensation limits imposed on qualified retirement plans under the Internal Revenue Code. We do not provide our NEOs with a defined benefit retirement program. We also do not provide retiree medical coverage to our NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Neidorff, as specified in his employment agreement.
With respect to most other benefits, the benefits provided to NEOs and other executive officers are comparable to those provided to the majority of salaried and hourly Company employees. We require all NEOs to have their tax returns prepared or reviewed by an independent certified public accounting firm. Due to this requirement, costs related to these services are paid by the Company. In addition, each NEO has the option to use a financial advisor for fees that do not exceed $15,000 annually, in total, for both tax preparation and financial advisement. These costs are also fully taxable to them and are not grossed up to cover any personal income tax liability.
The Board of Directors believes that additional security is required for the position of Chairman and CEO and other NEOs. Pursuant to a policy implemented by our Board, Mr. Neidorff is required to use Company-provided aircraft for all air travel. We also have an aircraft time sharing agreement with Mr. Neidorff that permits him to reimburse us for incremental costs when he uses the aircraft for personal travel. In addition, we provide home security services to our NEOs. The personal use of Company provided aircraft and home security services are fully taxable to our NEOs and are not grossed up to cover any personal income tax liability.

SECTION 4 - Other Compensation Policies and Information 
Stock Ownership Guidelines  
[END TABLE]
We utilize stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs, corporate officers and Board. We believe that ownership of our stock helps align the interests of our executives and stockholders, and encourages executives to act in a manner that is expected to increase stockholder value. The stock ownership guidelines for our officers are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Minimum Ownership Requirement as a Multiple of Base Salary 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 5x 
Executive Vice Presidents 2.5x 
Senior Vice Presidents 2x 
Market & Specialty Company Presidents & other Corporate Executives 1x 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the stock ownership levels of the Board and all officers. Future stock awards take into consideration the executive's level of attainment of the suggested stock ownership amount. The Compensation Committee may elect to award the annual incentive to an executive in stock instead of cash if the suggested stock ownership amount is not achieved. 
Officers who fail to achieve these ownership levels may not be eligible to receive any stock-based awards until they achieve their required ownership level. Shares owned directly by the officer (including those held as a joint tenant or as tenant in common), unvested RSUs, shares owned in a self-directed IRA, "phantom shares" held in the deferred compensation plan and certain shares owned or held for the benefit of a spouse or minor children are counted toward the guidelines. Options and unearned PSUs are not counted toward the ownership guidelines.  
The Board has established a policy requiring executive officers to retain ownership of the shares received from the vesting or payout of any RSU award granted under our stock incentive plan (net of any shares used to satisfy tax obligations) for one year following such vesting or payout. An executive may substitute the tax basis of the shares under restriction for other shares held outright.  
As of the close of the last fiscal year and the date of this report, all NEOs subject to the ownership guidelines are in compliance with the guidelines. At $57.65 per share (the December 31, 2018 closing stock price), our executive officers held Company stock as of a multiple of their 2018 base salaries as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name Minimum Ownership Requirement as a Multiple of Base Salary Ownership as a Multiple of 2018 Base Salary 
Michael F. Neidorff 5x 279.4x

Brandy L. Burkhalter 2.5x 14.6x 
Jesse N. Hunter 2.5x 31.3x 
[END TABLE]
Our stock ownership guidelines for members of our Board require them to own 40,000 shares of common stock within 5 years of being appointed to the Board. As of December 31, 2018, all directors were in compliance with this requirement.

Risk Disclosure 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee is aware of the consequences to companies that have not appropriately balanced risk and rewards in executive compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that the emphasis on long-term performance in the stock incentive plan and the Cash LTIP results in an overall compensation program that does not reward excessive risk-taking for the Company. Risk is further limited by the ownership guidelines mentioned previously and a clawback provision that provides that any cash bonuses that are paid from the annual incentive plan, Cash LTIP or vesting of PSUs that are a result of material financial impropriety (as defined by the Audit Committee of the Board), including but not limited to financial restatements due to these improprieties, may result in any officers becoming obligated to pay back the amount to the Company.  
The Company's compensation strategy is intended to mitigate risk by emphasizing long-term compensation and financial performance measures correlated with growing stockholder value rather than rewarding shorter performance and payout periods. A recent review of the Company's compensation programs by Exequity, LLP did not identify any programs that unduly incentivize employees to take any excessive risks.

CEO Employment Agreement 
[END TABLE]
Michael F. Neidorff serves as Chairman of our Board and our CEO pursuant to an employment agreement dated November 8, 2004 (as subsequently amended). Under this agreement, we paid Mr. Neidorff a 2018 annual salary of $1.5 million and will pay Mr. Neidorff a 2019 annual salary of $1.5 million, which is subject to an annual review by our Board. Mr. Neidorff is eligible for a target annual incentive of 150% of base salary. The agreement also awarded Mr. Neidorff 4,000,000 RSUs as of November 8, 2004. The RSUs and all of the related shares of common stock shall be distributed to Mr. Neidorff on the later of (a) January 15 of the first calendar year following termination of Mr. Neidorff's employment or (b) the date that is six months after Mr. Neidorff's "separation of service" as defined in the Code. Mr. Neidorff shall continue to vest in all of his outstanding long-term incentive awards while he serves as Chairman of the Board, regardless of whether he is serving as Executive Chairman or Non-Executive Chairman, and shall fully vest in any outstanding long-term incentives (subject to any performance measures to be determined at the end of any applicable performance period) upon his ultimate termination from the Board. Upon a change in control during the term of this agreement, any existing equity awards held by Mr. Neidorff will vest in full.

In February 2019, the Board and Mr. Neidorff agreed to extend his contract beyond the previous termination date to ensure continuity in the business and provide strategic perspective to continue long-term growth and margin improvement that will continue to result in long-term shareholder value. The Board also firmly believes that Mr. Neidorff's superior leadership is required for an additional period of time as Executive Chair in order to guide the Company through a turbulent and unknown regulatory environment, while at the same time, providing for an orderly transition of leadership as he will move from day-to-day activities into a more strategic and governmental affairs role. The amendment provides that Mr. Neidorff will continue to serve as Chairman and CEO until the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but continue serving as Executive Chairman until the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Effective with the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or other mutually agreed to date, Mr. Neidorff will become Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Neidorff did not receive any incremental cash or equity-based compensation for extending his contract. However, in connection with his expected continued involvement with strategic initiatives, community relations and government affairs while with the Company as Executive Chairman and for five years thereafter, he will continue to be subject to the Company's security policy requiring him to use Company-provided aircraft for all air travel, as well as the same security measures currently applicable to Mr. Neidorff as CEO. In addition, for the remainder of his life, Mr. Neidorff will continue to have an office at the Company's headquarters and use of one full-time administrative assistant. Mr. Neidorff will also have use of an additional part-time administrative assistant through December 31, 2024. 
In addition, Mr. Neidorff has agreed not to compete with us or solicit any of our employees during the term of his employment and for 12 months thereafter. Mr. Neidorff's employment may be terminated by the Company for cause or permanent disability, or by Mr. Neidorff for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement). If Mr. Neidorff is terminated by the Company without cause or if he terminates for good reason prior to December 31, 2019, he is entitled to receive salary continuation equivalent to six months of his salary plus half of his target bonus, lifetime medical insurance for him and his spouse, lifetime life insurance coverage, full acceleration of any unvested stock options or other equity awards held by him, and acceleration of a portion of unvested RSUs awarded pursuant to the agreement based on certain stipulations. The health and welfare benefits that Mr. Neidorff or his spouse would be entitled to, if he is terminated without cause or for good reason, were commitments made in his original employment agreement in 2004.

Severance and Change in Control Agreements 
[END TABLE]
Jeffrey A. Schwaneke, Mark J. Brooks, Brandy L. Burkhalter, and Jesse N. Hunter serve as executive officers pursuant to executive severance and change in control agreements (the agreements, as amended), and their 2019 annual salaries are $860,000, $600,000, $750,000, and $750,000, respectively. 
The agreements generally provide that, if within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in the agreements), the executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause (as defined in the agreements) or by the executive for good reason (as defined in the agreements), the executive will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (1) an amount equal to 24 months of salary, (b) the average of the executive's last two annual bonuses multiplied by two, and (c) a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs. The executive will also receive 18 months of medical coverage, and all existing equity awards will vest in full at the time of a change in control.
The agreements also generally provide that, if an executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause, the executive will receive 12 months of salary continuation, a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, 12 months of medical coverage and 12 months of continued vesting of the executive's existing equity awards. The terms of the agreements do not include tax gross-up benefits for excise taxes payable upon a change in control.
Under the terms of any new executive employment agreement, if any parts or amounts payable under the agreement are deemed to be "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or similar provision, the amount shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no amounts paid shall be deemed excess parachute payments or, if the net benefit is greater, no reduction will be made, but the executive will be required to pay any additional taxes.

2019 NOTICE OF MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT 
INFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
In the agreements, the executives agree to non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that extend through the first anniversary of termination of employment, unless the termination was due to a change in control as defined in the agreement. In 2012, the agreements were amended to eliminate the non-compete and non-solicitation provisions under any change in control.  
The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to ensure that we will have the continued dedication of the executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a change in control. The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened change in control, to encourage the executive's full attention and dedication to the Company, and to provide the executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a change in control which (i) will satisfy the executive's compensation and benefits expectations and (ii) are competitive with those of other major corporations.

Retirement Provisions 
[END TABLE]
In October of 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a prospective qualified retirement definition for stock awards. Employees who are at least 55 years of age and have 10 years of employment at the time of retirement are eligible for the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A pro-rated number of PSUs vesting at the end of the performance period, based on the amount of time employed during the performance period and actual performance outcomes. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A one-year acceleration of vesting of RSUs for individuals who are retirement eligible. RSU's for the Company's executive officers are not accelerated, but will have a one-year continuation of vesting upon a qualified retirement. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation  
[END TABLE]
Section 162(m)(6), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, amended the Code to limit the amount that certain healthcare insurers and providers, including the Company, may deduct for compensation to any employee in excess of $500,000 for a tax year beginning after December 31, 2012. This legislation does not create any exceptions for performance-based compensation and is not otherwise impacted by the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to use its judgment to authorize compensation payments that may be subject to the limit when the Compensation Committee believes such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of our stockholders, after taking into consideration changing business conditions and the performance of its employees. We were subject to the limitation in 2018.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
[END TABLE]
The section below describes the payments that may be made to our NEOs upon termination or a change in control. Generally, pursuant to our executive agreements, a change in control is deemed to occur: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If any individual, entity or group (other than a group which includes the executive) acquires 40% or more of the voting power of our outstanding securities; 
• If a majority of the incumbent Board of Directors are replaced. For these purposes, the incumbent Board of Directors means the directors who were serving as of the effective date of the applicable executive agreement and any individual who becomes a director subsequent to such date whose election or nomination for election was approved by a majority of such directors, other than in connection with a proxy contest; or 
• Upon the consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with another person, other than a merger or consolidation where the individuals and entities who were beneficial owners, respectively, of our outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such merger or consolidation own 50% or more of the then-outstanding shares of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation. 
[END TABLE]
The amounts presented below assume the termination or change in control occurred as of December 31, 2018. The NEOs would receive other payments and benefits to which they were already entitled or vested on such date, including amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan under the 'Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table'. The applicable agreements are discussed in the CD&A under the heading "Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment Arrangements, Change in Control Arrangements, and Retirement Provisions" included in this proxy statement. The change in control cash payments are subject to the conditions of the "double-trigger" criteria in each of the NEO's employment agreements. The equity award acceleration amounts below were calculated using the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 of $57.65. In the Change in Control column, the Cash LTIP and PSU awards are included at the greater of the target or actual level of performance as of December 31, 2018.

CEO to Median Employee Pay Ratio Information 
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we have included below a disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Neidorff. Because the applicable SEC rules allow companies to use a variety of methods to determine this ratio, the ratio disclosed by the Company may not be comparable to the ratio disclosed by other companies.
Mr. Neidorff's annual total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $26,132,414, which reflects the amount reported in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement plus $10,000 of the Company-paid portion of Mr. Neidorff's medical plan premiums. Due to multiple acquisitions, the Company recalculated our median employee for 2018. The annual total compensation for the median employee for the year ending December 31, 2018 was $66,021, inclusive of the Company-paid portion of the employee's medical plan premiums. Mr. Neidorff's annual total compensation was 396 times that of our median employee's pay.
In determining the median employee, we examined total cash compensation (i.e. base wages plus short-term incentive payments) for individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by the Company as of December 31, 2018. During this analysis, the compensation for employees hired during the year was annualized. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis, except 369 employees in the United Kingdom and 813 employees in Spain, which were excluded under the de minimis exemption. This resulted in 47,444 employees being included in our median employee calculation. 
After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation of the employee using the same methodology used for our NEOs within the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement, plus company-paid medical plan premiums capped at $10,000.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  
[END TABLE]
Directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of our common stock are required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to file reports with the SEC detailing their beneficial ownership of our common stock and other equity securities and reporting changes in such beneficial ownership. We are required to disclose any late filings of such reports.

A stockholder may also submit a proposal to be considered at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to our By-Laws (and not under SEC rules). In that case, the proposal would not be required to be included in our proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the proposal must be received by our Secretary not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting.

The deadline for delivery of a stockholder proposal pursuant to our By-Laws would be between November 25, 2019 and December 25, 2019.

Appendix A     
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES 
[END TABLE]
This proxy statement includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as the Company believes that these figures are helpful in allowing investors to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of the Company's operations and measure the Company's performance more consistently across periods. The Company uses the presented non-GAAP financial measures internally to allow management to focus on period-to-period changes in the Company's core business operations. Therefore, the Company believes that this information is meaningful in addition to the presented GAAP financial information. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for related GAAP financial information. 
Specifically, the Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial information that excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related expenses, as well as other items, allows investors to develop a more meaningful understanding of the Company's performance over time. The tables below provide reconciliations of non-GAAP items.
