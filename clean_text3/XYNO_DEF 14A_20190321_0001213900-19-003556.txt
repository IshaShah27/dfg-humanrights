TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BISON CAPITAL ACQUISITION CORP.:
You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Bison Capital Acquisition Corp. (the "Company" or "Bison") to be held at 9:30 a.m., eastern standard time, at Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC, located at 1450 Broadway, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10016, on March 21, 2019, for the purpose of considering and voting upon the following proposals:
No other business shall be transacted at the special meeting.
The Board has fixed the close of business on February 20, 2019 as the date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders of record of the Company's outstanding shares on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the special meeting or any adjournment. On the record date, there were 7,978,937 outstanding shares, including 6,037,500 outstanding public shares.
The purpose of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment is to allow the Company more time to complete its previously announced proposed business combination, which we refer to as the "Merger" or a "proposed business combination with Xynomic", by and among the Company, Bison Capital Merger Sub Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, Xynomic Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware ("Xynomic"), and Yinglin Mark Xu, solely in his capacity as the Shareholder Representative as contemplated in a merger agreement dated September 12, 2018 (as amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger is described further in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 12, 2018 and February 12, 2019, and in the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus initially filed with the SEC on January 4, 2019 and amended on February 12, 2019.
The proposed Merger qualifies as a "business combination" under the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, as amended and restated on June 19, 2017, which currently provides that if the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date, the Company will redeem all public shares for their pro rata portions of the Trust Account and, promptly following such redemption, dissolve and liquidate. As explained below, it is likely the Company will not be able to complete the Merger by the Current Termination Date. The Company believes that, given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on the proposed Merger with Xynomic, circumstances warrant providing public shareholders an opportunity to consider the proposed Merger. The Board is therefore proposing an amendment to the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the Current Termination Date to the Extended Termination Date, and proposing to make other corresponding changes in the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Trust Agreement in order to permit the actions contemplated by the extension of the Termination Date.
The approval of both the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are essential to the implementation of the Board's plan to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination. Therefore, the Board will abandon and not implement either amendment unless shareholders approve both the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. In all events, notwithstanding shareholder approval of both amendments, the Board will retain the right to abandon and not implement the Extension Amendment, the Trust Amendment or both at any time without any further action by shareholders.
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not approved, and the Merger or an alternative business combination is not consummated by the Current Termination Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders' rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (less the net interest earned thereon to pay dissolution expenses), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us for payment of taxes due on such funds. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company would expect to pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust fund or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance.
You are not being asked to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic at this time. If you are a public shareholder, you will have the right to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic when it is submitted to shareholders.
Public shareholders may elect to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment (the "Election"), regardless of how such public shareholders vote in regard to those amendments or otherwise at the special meeting. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001. The Company believes that such redemption right protects the Company's public shareholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable acquisition in the timeframe contemplated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association. If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved by the requisite vote of shareholders (and not abandoned), the remaining holders of public shares will retain their right to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account upon consummation of the proposed business combination with Xynomic when it is submitted to the shareholders, subject to any limitations set forth in the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the limitations contained in the Merger Agreement described in the accompanying proxy statement under the heading "The Potential Business Combination with Xynomic" and related agreements. In addition, public shareholders who vote for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment and do not make the Election would be entitled to redemption if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Termination Date. Each redemption of shares by our public shareholders will decrease the amount in our Trust Account, which held approximately $63,530,312.89 of marketable securities as of February 20, 2019.
PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO AFFIRMATIVELY VOTE EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT AND THE TRUST AMENDMENT IN ORDER TO REDEEM THEIR SHARES FOR A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE FUNDS HELD IN THE TRUST ACCOUNT. THIS MEANS THAT PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS WHO HOLD PUBLIC SHARES ON OR BEFORE MARCH 19, 2019 (TWO BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THE SPECIAL MEETING) MAY ELECT TO REDEEM THEIR SHARES WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE HOLDERS OF THE RECORD DATE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY VOTE FOR THE PROPOSALS OF THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT AND THE TRUST AMENDMENT. YOU MAY TENDER YOUR SHARES BY EITHER DELIVERING YOUR SHARE CERTIFICATE TO THE TRANSFER AGENT OR BY DELIVERING YOUR SHARES ELECTRONICALLY USING THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY'S DWAC (DEPOSIT WITHDRAWAL AT CUSTODIAN) SYSTEM. IF YOU HOLD THE SHARES IN STREET NAME, YOU WILL NEED TO INSTRUCT THE ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE AT YOUR BANK OR BROKER TO WITHDRAW THE SHARES FROM YOUR ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS. 
In considering whether to approve the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, the Company's shareholders should be aware that if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned), the Company will incur additional expenses in seeking to complete the proposed business combination with Xynomic, in addition to expenses incurred in proposing the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. Our sponsor, Bison Capital Holding Company Limited (the "Sponsor"), has loaned $600,000 in aggregate to the Company, among which, $500,000 is evidenced by two promissory notes issued by the Company. Our Sponsor has also committed to provide an additional $200,000 in loans to the Company. The Company has drawn down the entire $600,000 as of the date of this proxy statement. The notes become due on the date on which the Company consummates a business combination and carry no interest. The principal amount of the notes is convertible, in whole or in part, at the payee's election, upon the consummation of the Business Combination, into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit. These units, once issued pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the promissory notes, will be identical to the private units issued in a private placement in connection with the IPO. If we do not have sufficient funds available to conduct the normal operations of the business or to consummate the proposed business combination, we will need to seek additional working capital from our Sponsor for these purposes. If we consummate an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds or interest on such proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment.
Xynomic has issued Bison a commitment letter pursuant to which it has agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.02 for each public share that is not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on March 24, 2019 and on the 24th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by Bison to complete the Merger or another business combination from March 23, 2019 (the date by which Bison is currently required to complete its business combination) until the Extended Termination Date, subject to certain condition set forth below in this paragraph (the "Contribution"). For example, if Bison takes until June 24, 2019 to complete its business combination, which would represent three calendar months, Xynomic would make aggregate Contributions of approximately $362,250 (assuming no public shares were redeemed in connection with the Extension). Each Contribution will be deposited in the Trust Account established in connection with the IPO within seven calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof) expect that the portion of first Contribution for March 24, 2019 to March 31, 2019 will be deposited in the Trust Account within seven calendar days from March 24, 2019. The Contribution will be deposited as additional interest on the proceeds in the Trust Account and will be distributed pro rata as a part of redemption amount to each public share that is redeemed following the consummation of the Business Combination. Accordingly, if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved and the Extension is implemented and Bison takes the full time through the Extended Termination Date to complete the initial business combination, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or Bison's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.55 per share, in comparison to the redemption amount of $10.49 per share as of December 31, 2018 (assuming no public shares were redeemed in connection with the Extension). The Contribution is conditional upon the implementation of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. The Contribution will not occur if the Extension Amendment is not approved or the Extension is not completed. The amount of the Contribution will not bear interest and will be repayable by us to Xynomic upon consummation of an initial business combination.
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and has declared them advisable, and recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote "FOR" the Extension Amendment and "FOR" the Trust Amendment. In addition, the Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to direct the chairman of the special meeting to adjourn the special meeting.
Enclosed is the proxy statement containing detailed information concerning the Extension Amendment, and the Trust Amendment to be considered at the special meeting. We are providing the proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card to our shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. The proxy statement is dated March 4, 2019 and is first being mailed to shareholders of the Company on or about March 7, 2019 along with a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

If you are a registered shareholder, please vote your shares as soon as possible by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING 
OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD MARCH 21, 2019
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BISON CAPITAL ACQUISITION CORP.:
You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Bison Capital Acquisition Corp. (the "Company" or "Bison") to be held at 9:30 a.m., eastern standard time, at Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC, located at 1450 Broadway, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10016, on March 21, 2019, for the purpose of considering and voting upon the following proposals:
The Board has fixed the close of business on February 20, 2019 as the date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders of record of the Company's outstanding shares on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the special meeting or any adjournment. On the record date, there were 7,978,937 outstanding shares, including 6,037,500 outstanding public shares.
A quorum of 50% of the Company's shares outstanding as of the record date, present in person or by proxy, will be required to conduct the special meeting. The affirmative vote of 65% or more of the Company's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on the respective proposal of Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment will be required to approve each Amendment. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on the proposal will be required to direct the chairman of the special meeting to adjourn the special meeting.
Public shareholders may elect to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment (the "Election"), regardless of how such public shareholders vote in regard to those amendments or otherwise at the special meeting. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001.

In addition, public shareholders who vote for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment and do not make the Election would be entitled to redemption if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Termination Date.
Public shareholders are not required to affirmatively vote either for or against the extension amendment and the trust amendment in order to redeem their  shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account. This means that public shareholders who hold public shares on or before March 19, 2019 (two business days before the special meeting) may elect to redeem their shares whether or not they are holders of the record date, and whether or not they vote for the proposals of the extension amendment and the trust amendment. You may tender your shares by either delivering your share certificate to the transfer agent or by delivering your shares electronically using the depository trust company's DWAC (deposit withdrawal at custodian) system. If you hold the shares in street name, you will need to instruct the account executive at your bank or broker to withdraw the shares from your account in order to exercise your redemption rights. 
Xynomic has issued Bison a commitment letter pursuant to which it has agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.02 for each public share that is not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on March 24, 2019 and on the 24th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by Bison to complete the Merger or another business combination from March 23, 2019 (the date by which Bison is currently required to complete its business combination) until the Extended Termination Date (the "Contribution") subject to certain conditions set forth herein below in this paragraph.

       On February 22, 2019, the Merger Agreement          was further amended to extend the Outside Date from the Current Termination Date, or March 23, 2019 to June 24, 2019 or such earlier          date as determined by the Board and an amendment to the Merger Agreement and to the charter of the Company after the Domestication,          namely Certificate of Incorporation of Bison Capital Acquisition Corp., the domesticated parent entity following the Merger and          Domestication, was adopted to reflect the same, both taking effect upon receipt of the shareholder approval of Bison on the Extension          Amendment.   The Company believes that, given the Company's          expenditure of time, effort and money on the proposed business combination with Xynomic, circumstances warrant providing shareholders          an opportunity to consider the proposed business combination with Xynomic.   Holders of public shares may elect to redeem          their shares in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment regardless of how such public shareholders vote          in regard to those amendments. The Company believes that such redemption right protects the Company's public shareholders          from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable acquisition in          the timeframe contemplated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension          Amendment and the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net          tangible assets of less than $5,000,001.

Q. Why should I vote for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment?   A.  The approval of both the Extension Amendment          and the Trust Amendment are essential to the implementation of the Board's plan to extend the date by which the Company must          consummate its initial business combination.   From the date of our IPO through the execution          of the Merger Agreement on September 12, 2018, Bison considered a number of potential target companies with the objective of consummating          an acquisition. Representatives of Bison contacted, and were contacted by, a number of individuals and entities who offered to          present ideas for acquisition opportunities, including financial advisors and companies within the diversified industrial manufacturing,          distribution, and services sectors in the United States. Bison compiled a pipeline of high priority potential targets and updated          and supplemented such pipeline from time to time.

Representatives of Bison contacted, and were contacted by, a number of individuals and entities who offered to          present ideas for acquisition opportunities, including financial advisors and companies within the diversified industrial manufacturing,          distribution, and services sectors in the United States. Bison compiled a pipeline of high priority potential targets and updated          and supplemented such pipeline from time to time. 
Q. Why should I vote for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment?   A.  The approval of both the Extension Amendment          and the Trust Amendment are essential to the implementation of the Board's plan to extend the date by which the Company must          consummate its initial business combination.   From the date of our IPO through the execution          of the Merger Agreement on September 12, 2018, Bison considered a number of potential target companies with the objective of consummating          an acquisition.

       As the Company believes the proposed business          combination with Xynomic would be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, and because it is likely the Company          will not be able to conclude the proposed business combination with Xynomic by the Current Termination Date, the Company has determined          to seek shareholder approval to extend the time for closing a business combination beyond the Current Termination Date to the Extended          Termination Date. The particular changes required to effectuate this extension are embodied in the Extension Amendment and the          Trust Amendment.

Q. What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?   A.  Shareholder of Record. If your shares          are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you          are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Company sent the proxy materials directly to you.   Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street          Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, nominee or other similar organization,          then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the proxy materials were forwarded to you by          that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the          special meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization how to vote the shares held in your account.          Those instructions are contained in a "voting instruction form" containing information substantially similar to the          information set forth on the proxy card.

Q. What happens if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment aren't approved?   A.  If the Extension Amendment and the Trust          Amendment are not approved, and a business combination is not consummated by the Current Termination Date, the Company will (i)          cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business          days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders'          rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and          (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of shares          and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject          (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable          law.   In connection with our redemption of 100%          of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata          portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (less the net interest earned thereon to pay dissolution expenses), plus any pro          rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us for payment of taxes due on such          funds. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or          warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company would expect to pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets outside          of the trust fund or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance.

Q. Would I still be able to exercise my redemption rights if I vote against or abstain from voting on the Extension Amendment or Trust Amendment?   A.  Public shareholders may elect to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust  Account in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment regardless of how such public shareholders vote in regard  to those amendments or otherwise at the special meeting. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension Amendment and  the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets  of less than $5,000,001. If you abstain from voting on the Extension Amendment or the Trust Amendment, then you will not be eligible  to redeem your shares. Public shareholders are not required  to affirmatively vote either for or against the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment in order to redeem their shares for  a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account. This means that public shareholders who hold public shares on or before  March 19, 2019 (two business days before the special meeting) may elect to redeem their shares whether or not they are holders  of the record date, and whether or not they vote for the proposals of the extension amendment and the trust amendment. You may  tender your shares by either delivering your share certificate to the transfer agent or by delivering your shares electronically  using the depository trust company's DWAC (deposit withdrawal at custodian) system. If you hold the shares in street name,  you will need to instruct the account executive at your bank or broker to withdraw the shares from your account in order to exercise  your redemption rights.

Q. How do I change my vote?   A.  If you have submitted a proxy card to vote          your shares and wish to change your vote, you may do so by delivering a later-dated, signed proxy card to the Company's secretary          prior to the date of the special meeting or by voting in person at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting alone          will not change your vote.

The Company
Bison Capital Acquisition Corp. is a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 7, 2016. We were formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
As of the date hereof, we have not yet commenced any operations or generated any revenues. All activity from inception, relates to our formation, the consummation of our initial public offering (the "IPO") of 6,037,500 units, and the simultaneous sale of 432,062 private units in a private placement described below, and the identification and evaluation of prospective candidates for a business combination.
The registration statements for our IPO were declared effective on June 19, 2017. On June 23, 2017, we consummated the IPO of 5,250,000 units ("Units" and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the "Public Shares") at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $52,500,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 388,750 units (the "Private Units") at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to Bison Capital Holding Company Limited ("Bison Capital") and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. ("EarlyBirdCapital") and their designees, generating gross proceeds of $3,887,500.
Following the closing of the IPO and the private placement on June 23, 2017, an amount of $53,812,500 ($10.25 per IPO Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Units was placed in a trust account (the "Trust Account") and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.
On June 28, 2017, in connection with the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option in full, we consummated the sale of an additional 787,500 Units at $10.00 per Unit, and the sale of an additional 43,312 Private Units at approximately $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $8,308,125. A total of $8,071,875 of the net proceeds were deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $61,884,375.

As of December 31, 2018, $122,615 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account and was available for working capital purposes. Interest earned on the Trust Account balance through December 31, 2018 available to be released to us for the payment of income tax obligations amounted to approximately $1,426,509. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of $600,000, among which, $500,000 was in the form of a convertible note. On September 12, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Xynomic, Merger Sub, and Yinglin Mark Xu, solely in his capacity as the Stockholder Representative thereunder. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into Xynomic, with Xynomic continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger will become effective at such time on the closing date as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time specified in the certificate of merger. The transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement are referred as "proposed business combination with Xynomic" in the accompanying proxy statement.

The mailing address of the Company's principal executive office is 609-610 21st Century Tower, No. 40 Liangmaqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100016, China. The Proposed Business Combination with Xynomic 
Background of the Business Combination
The following is a brief description of the background of these negotiations, the Business Combination and related transactions.
From the date of our IPO through the execution of the Merger Agreement on September 12, 2018, Bison considered a number of potential target companies with the objective of consummating an acquisition. Representatives of Bison contacted, and were contacted by, a number of individuals and entities who offered to present ideas for acquisition opportunities, including financial advisors and companies within the diversified industrial manufacturing, distribution, and services sectors in the United States.
Bison reviewed the potential acquisition targets based on the same criteria discussed below and used in evaluating the Business Combination. These criteria included established middle-market businesses with proven track records, experienced management teams and strong competitive positions with, or with the potential for, revenue and earnings growth, and attractive free cash flow generation. Bison focused on sectors exhibiting secular growth or the potential for a near-term cyclical uptick, and within those sectors, focused only on companies that Bison management believed would benefit from being a publicly traded company.
In July 2017, Dr. James Jiayuan Tong, the Chief Executive Officer of Bison, inspected a computed tomography and positron emission tomography manufacturer ("Target 1") headquartered in Shaoxing, Jiangsu province of China. Target 1 has a research and development center in the U.S. focused on the design and development of high-end innovative medical imaging equipment. Bison visited headquarter of Target 1 in Shaoxing, Jiangsu and met with the senior officers of Target 1 on July 28, 2017. After reviewed an investment value analysis report and a legal due diligence report provided by Target 1, the parties discussed the valuation of Target 1 and possibility of the potential Business Combination. In early September, 2017, Bison was informed by Target 1 that they decided to seek direct listing opportunity in China capital markets.
During middle August 2017 to September 2017, Bison also considered a leading artificial intelligence platform based on scene application in China ("Target 2"). Target 2 provides big data application products and end-to-end solutions to customers in the financial industry to optimize the commercial value of big data. Their customers include many financial institutions in China. Mr. Peng Jin, the Chief Operation Officer of Bison, requested due diligence documents of Target 2 and engaged in several discussions with the Chief Executive Officer of Target 2 about its operations, revenue and projections, and the potential business combination. In August, 2017, Bison management reviewed and valuated Target 2 based on the collected information. After completing its analysis, Bison determined that Target 2 did not represent the best opportunity for a successful business combination based on the uncertainty in the projections as a result of the lack of the stability in the market growth of Target 2 and its variable customer base.
During September 2017 to December 2017, Bison also inspected an online and mobile platform that provides individual consumers with medicines (prescription and OTC), health products, skin care products, maternal and baby products and other products in China with fast growth ("Target 3"). Target 3 operates thousands of SKUs online and its sales volume maintains a significant growth rate of more than 50% per year during 2017 compared to 2016 based on the information we received from Target 3. Chief Executive Officer of Bison Capital Dr. James Jiayuan Tong also conducted an onsite visit to Target 3 on December 21 of 2017 and met its founding shareholder. Management considered the rapid growth of the company was due to the preferential industry policy in Southern China and prescription medicine accounted for a large percentage of the total sales volume. While the exponential growth was clearly an indication of viable business plan and effective execution by able management, Bison saw the uncertainties in the regulatory policies in prescription medicines sales and the business and development in other part of China. The risk profile prevents the company to be listed as a candidate of business combination.
Bison reviewed the potential acquisition targets based on the same criteria discussed below and used in evaluating the Business Combination. These criteria included established middle-market businesses with proven track records, experienced management teams and strong competitive positions with, or with the potential for, revenue and earnings growth, and attractive free cash flow generation. Bison focused on sectors exhibiting secular growth or the potential for a near-term cyclical uptick, and within those sectors, focused only on companies that Bison management believed would benefit from being a publicly traded company. Timeline of the Business Combination
The below description is a summary of certain material events occurred in connection with the proposed business combination with Xynomic, for more details about the timeline of the Business Combination, please refer to the proxy statement/prospectus Bison filed on January 4, 2019 and amended on February 12, 2019 (File No. 333-229127).
During Bison's search for a suitable target for a business combination, Bison had looked at several healthcare service businesses in China including Target 1 and Target 3. Bison learned about Xynomic in August 2017 when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xynomic, Yinglin Mark Xu, discussed Xynomic's business plan with us. In late August 2017, we selected Xynomic as a potential target for a SPAC transaction based on: (i) Xynomic's valuable Phase 3 oncology biotech assets in-licensed from major international pharmaceutical companies, (ii) strong market demand with multiple clinical indications, comprehensive clinical data, and decades of academic research, (iii) a highly experienced management team and scientific advisory board consisting of industry veterans and key opinion leaders ("KOLs") in oncology drug research and development in the U.S., Europe, and China, (iv) several clinical milestones in 2018 that indicate meaningful value growth of Xynomic, and (v) the willingness to seek public listing in the near term to further expand the business internationally.
Beginning in March 2018, Bison and its advisors continued to conduct business, financial, legal, and accounting due diligence in coordination with Xynomic and its advisors. At the same time, representatives and advisors of Xynomic and Bison began to negotiate preliminary terms of the definitive transaction agreements.
On May 7, 2018, Bison entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Xynomic which set forth the preliminary agreed terms of the proposed business combination. During the period from May 7, 2018 until the entry into the Merger Agreement, Bison engaged Venture Valuation as its financial advisor to work closely with and under the instructions of Bison management to interview Xynomic management and scientific team, conduct market research and investigate the business and operation of Xynomic to render a sensitivity analysis of different assumptions and a value range of pre-money equity of Xynomic. Extensive due diligence on Xynomic and negotiations with Xynomic were conducted by Bison and its representatives. During the same period, Cassel Salpeter was formally engaged by Bison on behalf of the special committee, consisting of only independent directors of Bison (the "Special Committee"), to render a fairness opinion to the Special Committee in connection with the potential business combination.
On September 12, 2018, Bison and Xynomic entered into the Merger Agreement. The proposed business combination with Xynomic and the entry into the Merger Agreement were approved by the Special Committee and the board of the directors of Bison.
On December 20, 2018, Xynomic announced publicly that it had been granted an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize BI 860585, a phase 2 ready mTORC1/2 inhibitor, from Boehringer Ingelheim. On December 22, Bison notified Xynomic that it agreed with Xynomic's position that the earnout criteria as provided in the Merger Agreement had been achieved.
On February 11, 2019, the parties amended the Merger Agreement to adopt an amendment to the charter of the combined entity, namely Certificate of Incorporation of Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., the combined entity following the Merger, to clarify that its exclusive forum provision does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder. On February 22, 2019, the parties further amended the Merger Agreement to extend the Outside Date (defined therein) from the Current Termination Date, or March 23, 2019 to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by the Board and adopt an amendment to the Merger Agreement and to the charter of the Company after the Domestication, namely Certificate of Incorporation of Bison Capital Acquisition Corp., the domesticated parent entity following the Merger and Domestication, to reflect the same, effective upon receipt of Bison's shareholder approval of the Extension Amendment.
You are NOT being asked to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic at this time. If you are a public shareholder, you will have the right to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic when it is submitted to shareholders.
The Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment
The Extension Amendment
The Company is proposing to amend its Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date before which the Company must complete a business combination (the "Termination Date") from March 23, 2019 (the "Current Termination Date") to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by the Board (the "Extended Termination Date"), and provide that the date for cessation of operations of the Company if the Company has not completed a business combination would similarly be extended by amending the Memorandum and Articles of Association to delete the existing Regulation 23.2 of the Articles of Association and replacing it with the new Regulation 23.2 in the form set forth in Annex A.
The Trust Amendment
The Company is proposing to amend the Trust Agreement to extend the date on which to commence liquidating the Trust Account in the event the Company has not consummated a business combination from the Current Termination Date to the Extended Termination Date by amending the Trust Agreement in the form set forth in Annex B.
A shareholder's approval of the Trust Amendment will constitute consent to the use of the Company's Trust Account proceeds to pay, at the time the Extension Amendment becomes effective, and in exchange for surrender of shares, pro rata portions of the funds available in the Trust Account to the public shareholders making the Election in lieu of later distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not Approved
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not approved and a business combination is not consummated by the Current Termination Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders' rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account (less the net interest earned thereon to pay dissolution expenses), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us for payment of taxes due on such funds. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company would expect to pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust fund or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account's balance. If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are Approved
Under the terms of the proposed Extension Amendment and Trust Amendment, public shareholders may make the Election.
If the Extension Amendment is approved by a majority or more of the shares outstanding as of the record date present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on the Extension Amendment and not abandoned and the Trust Amendment is approved by a majority or more of the shares outstanding as of the record date present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on the Trust Amendment and not abandoned, the Company will file amended version of the Memorandum and Articles of Association with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands incorporating the amendment to Regulation 23 therein in the form of Annex A hereto and the Company will enter into the Trust Amendment with the Trustee substantially in the form of Annex B hereto. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and its units, shares, warrants and rights will remain publicly traded. The Company will then continue to work to consummate a business combination until the Extended Termination Date. 
You are NOT being asked to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic at this time. If you are a public shareholder, you will have the right to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic when it is submitted to shareholders.
Xynomic has issued Bison a commitment letter pursuant to which it has agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.02 for each public share that is not redeemed, for each calendar month (commencing on March 24, 2019 and on the 24th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by Bison to complete the Merger or another business combination from March 23, 2019 (the date by which Bison is currently required to complete its business combination) until the Extended Termination Date, subject to certain conditions set forth below in this paragraph (the "Contribution"). For example, if Bison takes until June 24, 2019 to complete its business combination, which would represent three calendar months, Xynomic would make aggregate Contributions of approximately $362,250 (assuming no public shares were redeemed in connection with the Extension). Each Contribution will be deposited in the Trust Account established in connection with the IPO within seven calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof) expect that the portion of first Contribution for March 24, 2019 to March 31, 2019 will be deposited in the Trust Account within seven calendar days from March 24, 2019. The Contribution will be deposited as additional interest on the proceeds in the Trust Account and will be distributed pro rata as a part of redemption amount to each public share that is redeemed following the consummation of the Business Combination. Accordingly, if the Extension Amendment is approved and the Extension is implemented and Bison takes the full time through the Extended Termination Date to complete the initial business combination, the redemption amount per share at the special meeting for such business combination or Bison's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.55 per share, in comparison to the redemption amount of $10.49 per share as of December 31, 2018 (assuming no public shares were redeemed in connection with the Extension). The Contribution is conditional upon the implementation of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. The Contribution will not occur if either of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment is not approved or the Extension is not completed. The amount of the Contribution will not bear interest and will be repayable by us to Xynomic upon consummation of an initial business combination.
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned), the removal of the funds in connection with the redemption from the Trust Account may significantly reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of the Company's shares held by the Company's directors, officers and senior advisors.
Additionally, the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that the Company shall not consummate any business combination if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001, which could be impacted by the reduction in the Trust Account. Possible Claims Against and Impairment of the Trust Account
In considering the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, the Company's shareholders should be aware that if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned), the Company will incur additional expenses in seeking to complete the proposed business combination with Xynomic, in addition to expenses incurred in proposing the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. Our Sponsor has loaned $600,000 in aggregate to the Company, among which, $500,000 is evidenced by two promissory notes issued by the Company. Our Sponsor has also committed to provide an additional $200,000 in loans to the Company. The Company has drawn down the entire $600,000 as of the date of this proxy statement. The notes become due on the date on which the Company consummates a business combination and carry no interest. The principal amount of the notes is convertible, in whole or in part, at the payee's election, upon the consummation of the Business Combination, into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit. These units, once issued pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the promissory notes, will be identical to the private units issued in a private placement in connection with the IPO. If we do not have sufficient funds available to conduct the normal operations of the business or to consummate the proposed business combination, we will need to seek additional working capital from our Sponsor for these purposes. If we consummate an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds or interests on such proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment.
If the Company is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, our Sponsor, Bison Capital, will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to it, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of claims against the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Bison Capital will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that, Bison Capital would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below $10.25 per share and Bison Capital asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine on our behalf whether to take legal action against Bison Capital to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Bison Capital to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations on our behalf, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.25 per share. You should read this proxy statement carefully for more information concerning this possibility and other consequences of the adoption of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Shareholders Exercising Redemption Rights
The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations for holders of Bison ordinary shares that elect to have their Bison ordinary shares redeemed for cash if the acquisition is completed. This summary is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, current administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described below. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this summary. This summary does not discuss the impact that U.S. state and local taxes and taxes imposed by non-U.S. jurisdictions could have on the matters discussed in this summary. This summary does not purport to discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a particular shareholder in light of its investment or tax circumstances or to shareholders subject to special tax rules, such as: If any partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Bison ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding Bison ordinary shares, you should consult your tax advisor. This summary assumes that shareholders hold Bison ordinary shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means as property held for investment and not as a dealer or for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the shareholder's trade or business.

A Redeeming U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the redemption and such shareholder's adjusted basis in the Bison ordinary shares exchanged therefore if the Redeeming U.S. Holder's ownership of stock in Bison is completely terminated or if the redemption meets certain other tests described below. Special constructive ownership rules under Section 318 of the Code apply in determining whether a Redeeming U.S. Holder's ownership of stock in Bison is treated as completely terminated. Pursuant to these constructive ownership rules, a Redeeming U.S. Holder will be deemed to own stock that is actually or constructively owned by certain members of his or her family (spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents) and other related parties including, for example, certain entities in which such Redeeming U.S. Holder has a direct or indirect interest (including partnerships, estates, trusts and corporations), as well as shares of stock that such Redeeming U.S. Holder (or a related person) has the right to acquire upon exercise of an option or conversion right. In addition, if a shareholder lives in a community property state, the community property laws of that state may have an effect on the constructive ownership rules. Certain exceptions to the family attribution rules apply for the purpose of determining a complete termination. If a Redeeming U.S. Holder intends to rely upon these exceptions, the Redeeming U.S. Holder must file a "waiver of family attribution" statement with the shareholder's tax return and must comply with certain other requirements set forth in the Code and the income tax regulations promulgated thereunder. If gain or loss treatment applies, such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period of such stock is more than one year at the time of the exchange. Shareholders who hold different blocks of Bison ordinary shares (generally, Bison ordinary shares purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to them. Cash received upon redemption that does not completely terminate the Redeemed U.S. Holder's interest will still give rise to capital gain or loss, if the redemption is either (i) "substantially disproportionate" or (ii) "not essentially equivalent to a dividend." In determining whether the redemption is substantially disproportionate or not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to a Redeeming U.S. Holder, that Redeeming U.S. Holder is deemed to own not just stock he, she, or it actually owned but also, in some cases, stock owned by certain family members, certain estates and trusts of which the Redeeming U.S. Holder is a beneficiary, and certain other affiliated entities.
Generally, the redemption will be "substantially disproportionate" with respect to the Redeeming U.S. Holder if (i) the Redeeming U.S. Holder's percentage ownership of the outstanding voting stock (including all classes which carry voting rights) of Bison is reduced immediately after the redemption to less than 80% of the Redeeming U.S. Holder's percentage interest in such stock immediately before the redemption; (ii) the Redeeming U.S. Holder's percentage ownership of the outstanding ordinary shares (both voting and nonvoting) immediately after the redemption is reduced to less than 80% of such percentage ownership immediately before the redemption; and (iii) the Redeeming U.S. Holder owns, immediately after the redemption, less than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of Bison entitled to vote. Whether the redemption will be considered "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to a Redeeming U.S. Holder will depend upon the particular circumstances of that Redeeming U.S. Holder. At a minimum, however, the redemption must result in a meaningful reduction in the Redeeming U.S. Holder's actual or constructive percentage ownership of Bison.
The IRS has ruled that any reduction in a shareholder's proportionate interest generally is a "meaningful reduction" if the shareholder's relative interest in the corporation is minimal and the shareholder does not have meaningful control over the corporation. (See, Rev. Rules. 75-512 and 76-385)
If none of the redemption tests described above give rise to capital gain or loss, the consideration paid to the Redeeming U.S. Holder will be treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. However, for the purposes of the dividends-received deduction and of "qualified dividend" treatment, due to the redemption right, a Redeeming U.S. Holder may be unable to include the time period prior to the redemption in the shareholder's "holding period" as part of the Redeeming U.S. Holder's determination as to whether such gain or loss would be treated as short term or long term for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any distribution in excess of our earnings and profits will reduce the Redeeming U.S. Holder's basis in the Bison ordinary shares (but not below zero), and any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Bison ordinary shares.
These rules are complex and U.S. holders of Bison ordinary shares considering exercising their redemption rights should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the redemption will be treated as a sale or as a distribution under the Code.
Certain Redeeming U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates, or trusts pay a 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their "net investment income" or "undistributed net investment income" (as applicable), which may include all or a portion of their capital gain or dividend income from their redemption of Bison ordinary shares. Redeeming U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the net investment income tax.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to Non-U.S. Bison Shareholders
This section is addressed to Redeeming non-U.S. holders of Bison ordinary shares that elect to have their Bison ordinary shares redeemed for cash as described in the section entitled "Special Meeting — Redemption Rights." For purposes of this discussion, a "Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership) that so redeems its Bison ordinary shares and is not a Redeeming U.S. Holder.
Except as discussed in the following paragraph, a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder who elects to have its Bison ordinary shares redeemed will generally be treated in the same manner as a U.S. Holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the discussion above under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Bison Shareholders." Any redeeming Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any capital gain recognized as a result of the exchange unless:
With respect to any redemption treated as a distribution rather than a sale, any amount treated as dividend income to a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty. Dividends received by a Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with such holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, such dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), are includible in the Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder's gross income in the taxable year received. Although generally not subject to withholding tax, such dividends are taxed at the same graduated rates applicable to Redeeming U.S. Holders, net of certain deductions and credits, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. In addition, dividends received by a corporate Redeeming Non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with the holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
Non-U.S. holders of Bison ordinary shares considering exercising their redemption rights should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the redemption of their Bison ordinary shares will be treated as a sale or as a distribution under the Code.
Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA") and U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance thereunder, a 30% United States federal withholding tax may apply to any dividends paid to (i) a "foreign financial institution" (as specifically defined in FATCA), whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify, report, and disclose its United States "account" holders (as specifically defined in FATCA) and meets certain other specified requirements or (ii) a non-financial foreign entity, whether such non-financial foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, unless such entity provides a certification that the beneficial owner of the payment does not have any substantial United States owners or provides the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each such substantial United States owner and certain other specified requirements are met. In many cases, the relevant foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity may qualify for an exemption from, or be deemed to be in compliance with, these rules under the terms of an intergovernmental agreement between their home country and the United States. Redeeming Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding this legislation and whether it may be relevant to their disposition of Bison ordinary shares, rights or warrants.
Backup Withholding
In general, proceeds received from the exercise of redemption rights will be subject to backup withholding for a non-corporate U.S. shareholder that: A non-U.S. shareholder generally may eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption.
Any amount withheld under these rules will be creditable against the U.S. shareholder's or non-U.S. shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability or refundable to the extent that it exceeds this liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS and other applicable requirements are met.
We urge you to consult with your own tax adviser to determine the particular tax consequences to you (including the application and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
Company's Recommendation to Shareholders
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Company's board of directors has determined that the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders. The board of directors has approved and declared advisable the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, and recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. See the section entitled "Reasons for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment — The Board's Reasons for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, its Conclusion, and its Recommendation."
Interests of the Company's Officers and Directors
When you consider the recommendation of the Company's board of directors, you should keep in mind that the Company's executive officers and members of the Company's board of directors have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. See the section entitled "Reasons for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment — Interests of the Company's Officers, Directors, Advisors and Majority Shareholder."
Stock Ownership
Information concerning the holdings of certain of the Company's shareholders is set forth below under "Beneficial Ownership of Securities." THE SPECIAL MEETING
The Company is furnishing this proxy statement to its shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company's board of directors for use at the special meeting. This proxy statement provides you with the information you need to know to be able to vote or instruct your vote to be cast at the special meeting.
Date, Time and Place. The special meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m., eastern standard time, at Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC, located at 1450 Broadway, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10016, on March 21, 2019.
Purpose. At the special meeting, holders of the Company's shares will be asked to approve the following proposals:
Each proposal of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are essential to the overall implementation of the board of directors' plan to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination, and, therefore, the Company's board of directors will abandon the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment unless both are approved by shareholders. Notwithstanding shareholder approval of all proposals, the Company's board of directors will retain the right to abandon and not effect the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment at any time prior to its effectiveness without any further action by shareholders.
A shareholder's approval of the Trust Amendment will constitute consent to the use of the Company's Trust Account proceeds to pay, at the time the Extension Amendment becomes effective, and in exchange for surrender of shares, pro rata portions of the funds available in the Trust Account to the public shareholders making the Election in lieu of later distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders. The Board has approved and declared advisable the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, and recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption of the Extension Amendment and "FOR" the adoption of the Trust Amendment.
Because of the business combination provisions of the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, if the proposed business combination with Xynomic is not completed by the Current Termination Date, the Company will redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account, unless shareholders approve the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
The special meeting has been called only to consider approval of the proposals set forth herein. No other business shall be transacted at the special meeting. You are NOT being asked to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic at this time. If you are a public shareholder, you will have the right to vote on the proposed business combination with Xynomic when it is submitted to shareholders.
Record Date; Who is Entitled to Vote. The record date for the special meeting is February 20, 2019. Record holders of the Company's shares at the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote or have their votes cast at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 7,978,937 outstanding shares (including 6,037,500 outstanding public shares), each of which entitles its holder to cast one vote per proposal.
Votes Required. Approval of each of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment will require the affirmative vote of holders of sixty-five percent (65%) or more of the Company's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on the respective proposal of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on the proposal will be required to direct the chairman of the special meeting to adjourn the special meeting.
The Company believes that given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on the proposed business combination with Xynomic, circumstances warrant providing public shareholders an opportunity to consider the proposed business combination with Xynomic. However, the Company's IPO prospectus stated that if the effect of any proposed amendments to the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, if adopted, would delay the date on which a shareholder could otherwise redeem shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account, the Company will provide that, if such amendments are approved by holders of sixty-five percent (65%) or more of the Company's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on such amendments, public shareholders will have the right to redeem their public shares. Accordingly, holders of public shares may elect to redeem their shares in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment regardless of how such public shareholders vote. The Company believes that such redemption right protects the Company's public shareholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable acquisition in the timeframe contemplated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001.
All public shareholders may make the Election. If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved by the requisite vote of shareholders and not abandoned, the remaining holders of public shares will retain their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account upon consummation of the proposed business combination with Xynomic, subject to any limitations set forth in the Memorandum and Articles of Association and limitations agreed to in the Merger Agreement or related agreements. In addition, public shareholders who vote for the Extension Amendment or the Trust Amendment and do not make the election would be entitled to redemption if the Company has not completed the proposed business combination with Xynomic by the Extended Termination Date.
A shareholder's approval of the Trust Amendment will constitute consent to the use of the Company's Trust Account proceeds to pay, at the time the Extension Amendment becomes effective, and in exchange for surrender of shares, pro rata portions of the funds available in the Trust Account to the public shareholders making the Election in lieu of later distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
Abstentions will have no effect on the Extension Amendment, the Trust Amendment or the other proposals in this proxy statement.
The Company's board of directors believes the current shareholders are not prejudiced by the proposed Extension Amendment and Trust Amendment since all holders of public shares are concurrently being offered the opportunity to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. All of the Company's directors, executive officers and their affiliates as well as other shareholders of the Company are expected to vote any shares (including any public shares owned by them) in favor of the Extension Amendment, the Trust Amendment and the other proposals set forth herein. On the record date, these shareholders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 1,911,250 shares, representing approximately 23.95% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares.
Voting Your Shares. Each share that you own in your name entitles you to one vote per proposal. Your proxy card shows the number of shares you own.
If you are a shareholder with shares registered in your name, you may vote in person at the special meeting or by proxy card by completing, signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided.
If your shares are held in the "street name" of your broker, bank or another nominee, you must obtain a proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee to vote in person at the special meeting. That is the only way we can be sure that the broker, bank or nominee has not already voted your shares.
Revoking Your Proxy and Changing Your Vote. If you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before the special meeting or at such meeting by doing any one of the following:
Broker Non-Votes. If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not give the broker voting instructions, your broker will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Extension Amendment, and the Trust Amendment. This is known as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes will have no effect on the Extension Amendment, the Trust Amendment or the direction for election of the directors.
Questions About Voting. The Company has retained Advantage Proxy to assist it in the solicitation of proxies. If you have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares, you may contact Advantage Proxy at (877) 870-8565 (toll free) or by email at ksmith@advantageproxy.com. You may also want to consult your financial and other advisors about the vote.
Solicitation Costs. The Company is soliciting proxies on behalf of the Company's board of directors. This solicitation is being made by mail but also may be made in person. The Company and its respective directors, officers, employees and consultants may also solicit proxies in person or by mail. The Company has agreed to pay Advantage Proxy a fee of $4,000 for its services and reimburse its expenses up to $500 in connection with the special meeting.
The Company will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward its proxy materials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions. The Company will reimburse them for their reasonable expenses.
Stock Ownership. Information concerning the holdings of certain of the Company's shareholders is set forth below under "Beneficial Ownership of Securities."
Redemption Rights. Pursuant to our charter, any holders of our public shares may demand that such shares be redeemed in exchange for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account, less taxes payable, calculated as of two business days prior to the special meeting. If redemption demand is properly and timely made and the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved by the shareholders, these shares under the redemption demand, will cease to be outstanding and will represent only the right to receive a pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account which holds the proceeds of our IPO (calculated as of two business days prior to the special meeting, less taxes payable). For illustrative purposes, based on funds in the trust account of approximately $63,530,312.89 on the record date, the estimated per share redemption price would have been approximately $10.52. In order to exercise your redemption rights, you must:
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
1 State Street, 30th Floor
New York, NY 10004-1561
Attn: Mark Zimkind
Email: mzimkind@continentalstock.com;
and
Any demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising redemption requests (and submitting shares to the transfer agent) and thereafter, with our consent, until the vote is taken with respect to the Business Combination. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide within the required timeframe not to exercise your redemption rights, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the phone number or address listed above.
Each redemption of Bison ordinary shares by our public shareholders will decrease the amount in our trust account, which held $63,530,312.89 of marketable securities as of the record date.
Prior to exercising redemption rights, shareholders should verify the market price of our ordinary shares, as they may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their ordinary shares in the public market than from exercising their redemption rights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your ordinary shares in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in our ordinary shares when you wish to sell your shares.
If you exercise your redemption rights, your ordinary shares will cease to be outstanding and will only represent the right to receive a pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account. You will no longer own those shares and will have no right to participate in, or have any interest in, the future growth of the Company. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly and timely demand redemption.
Holders of outstanding units must separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares.
If you hold units registered in your own name, you must deliver the certificate for such units to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company with written instructions to separate such units into public shares and public warrants. This must be completed far enough in advance to permit the mailing of the public share certificates back to you so that you may then exercise your redemption rights upon the separation of the public shares from the units.
If a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company, or other nominee holds your units, you must instruct such nominee to separate your units. Your nominee must send written instructions by facsimile to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Such written instructions must include the number of units to be separated and the nominee holding such units. Your nominee must also initiate electronically, using DTC's deposit withdrawal at custodian (DWAC) system, a withdrawal of the relevant units and a deposit of an equal number of public shares and public warrants. This must be completed far enough in advance to permit your nominee to exercise your redemption rights upon the separation of the public shares from the units. While this is typically done electronically the same business day, you should allow at least one full business day to accomplish the separation. If you fail to cause your public shares to be separated in a timely manner, you will likely not be able to exercise your redemption rights. THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT
The Company is proposing to amend its Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date before which the Company must complete a business combination (the "Termination Date") from March 23, 2019 (the "Current Termination Date") to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by the Board (the "Extended Termination Date"), and provide that the date for cessation of operations of the Company if the Company has not completed a business combination would similarly be extended by amending the Memorandum and Articles of Association to delete the existing Regulation 23.2 of the Articles of Association and replacing it with the new Regulation 23.2 in the form set forth in Annex A to this proxy statement.
Each proposal of the Extension Amendment is essential to the overall implementation of the board of directors' plan to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination. The implementation of such proposals is conditioned on the approval of the Trust Amendment proposal, and, therefore, the Company's board of directors will abandon the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment unless each of the above proposals and the Trust Amendment are approved by shareholders. Notwithstanding shareholder approval of all proposals, the Company's board of directors will retain the right to abandon and not effect the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment at any time prior to its effectiveness without any further action by shareholders.
A copy of the proposed new Regulation 23.2 of the Articles of Association of the Company, that will replace the existing Regulation 23.2, is annexed to this proxy statement as Annex A. If Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved, the Company will file an amended form of the Memorandum and Articles of Association with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the British Virgin Islands.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote by holders of sixty-five percent (65%) or more of the Company's outstanding shares present in person or by proxy at the special meeting and voting on the Extension Amendment, is required to approve the Extension Amendment. THE TRUST AMENDMENT
The Company is proposing to amend the Company's Trust Agreement to extend the date on which to commence liquidating the Trust Account in the event the Company has not consummated a business combination from the Current Termination Date to the Extended Termination Date by amending the Trust Agreement in the form set forth in Annex B.
The Trust Amendment is essential to the overall implementation of the board of directors' plan to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination. The implementation of such proposal is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Amendment proposal, and, therefore, the Company's board of directors will abandon the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment unless each of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment is approved by shareholders. Notwithstanding shareholder approval of all proposals, the Company's board of directors will retain the right to abandon and not effect the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment at any time prior to its effectiveness without any further action by shareholders.
A shareholder's approval of the Trust Amendment will constitute consent to the use of the Company's Trust Account proceeds to pay, at the time the Extension Amendment becomes effective, and in exchange for surrender of shares, pro rata portions of the funds available in the Trust Account to the public shareholders making the Election in lieu of later distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
A copy of the proposed amendment to the trust agreement is set forth in Annex B.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote by holders of sixty-five percent (65%) or more of the Company's outstanding shares present in person or by proxy at the special meeting and voting on the Trust Amendment, is required to approve the Trust Amendment. REASONS FOR THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT AND THE TRUST AMENDMENT
The Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association currently provides that if a business combination is not consummated by the Current Termination Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders' rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.
In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (less the net interest earned thereon to pay dissolution expenses), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes payable on such funds. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company would expect to pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust fund or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance.
The Trust Agreement provides that, unless a business combination is consummated by the Current Termination Date, the Trustee would be required to commence liquidation on the Current Termination Date. Moreover, the Trust Agreement provides that funds may be withdrawn from the Trust Account only upon consummation of an initial business combination, in connection with the failure of the Company to consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date or other limited purposes. The Trust Amendment is necessary to extend the period for the Company to consummate a business combination from the Current Termination Date to the Extended Termination Date and to permit the withdrawal and distribution of the funds to public shareholders who properly demand redemption in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
Our Sponsor and the initial shareholders have each waived their respective redemption rights with respect to their shares if we fail to consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company would expect to pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust fund or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance. In considering the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, the Company's board of directors came to the conclusion that the potential benefits of the proposed business combination with Xynomic to the Company and its shareholders outweighed the possibility of any liability as a result of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
From the date of our IPO through the execution of the Merger Agreement on September 12, 2018, Bison considered a number of potential target companies with the objective of consummating an acquisition. Representatives of Bison contacted, and were contacted by, a number of individuals and entities who offered to present ideas for acquisition opportunities, including financial advisors and companies within the diversified industrial manufacturing, distribution, and services sectors in the United States. Bison compiled a pipeline of high priority potential targets and updated and supplemented such pipeline from time to time. This pipeline was periodically shared, in depth, with the Board of Directors of Bison.
During that period, Bison and representatives of Bison: Bison reviewed the potential acquisition targets based on the same criteria discussed below and used in evaluating the Business Combination. These criteria included established middle-market businesses with proven track records, experienced management teams and strong competitive positions with, or with the potential for, revenue and earnings growth, and attractive free cash flow generation. Bison focused on sectors exhibiting secular growth or the potential for a near-term cyclical uptick, and within those sectors, focused only on companies that Bison management believed would benefit from being a publicly traded company.
The proposed business combination with Xynomic qualifies as a "business combination" under the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, but it is likely the Company will not be able to complete that transaction by the Current Termination Date.
As the Company believes the proposed business combination with Xynomic would be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, and because it is likely the Company will not be able to conclude the proposed business combination with Xynomic by the Current Termination Date, the Company has determined to seek shareholder approval to extend the time for closing a business combination beyond the Current Termination Date to the Extended Termination Date.
The Company believes that given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on the proposed business combination with Xynomic, circumstances warrant providing public shareholders an opportunity to consider the proposed business combination with Xynomic. However, the Company's IPO prospectus stated that if the effect of any proposed amendments to the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, if adopted, would be to delay the date on which a shareholder could otherwise redeem shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account, the Company will provide that, if such amendments are approved by holders of sixty-five percent (65%) or more of the Company's shares present in person or by proxy at the special meeting and voting on such amendments, public shareholders will have the right to redeem their public shares. Accordingly, holders of public shares may elect to redeem their shares (other than those held by our Sponsor, directors and officers) in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Agreement regardless of how such public shareholders vote. The Company believes that such redemption right protects the Company's public shareholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable acquisition in the timeframe contemplated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association.
All public shareholders may make the Election. If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved by the requisite vote of shareholders and not abandoned, the remaining holders of public shares will retain their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account upon consummation of the proposed business combination with Xynomic, subject to any limitations set forth in the Memorandum and Articles of Association and limitations agreed to in the Merger Agreement or related agreements. In addition, public shareholders who vote for the Extension Amendment or the Trust Amendment and do not make the Election would be entitled to redemption if the Company has not completed the proposed business combination with Xynomic by the Extended Termination Date. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001.
As noted in "Reasons for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment — Possible Claims Against and Impairment of the Trust Account," below, the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment will result in the Company incurring additional transaction expenses. The Company's board of directors believes that, if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned) and no material liabilities are sought to be satisfied from the Trust Account, any resulting redemptions would have no adverse effect on the public shareholders because they would receive approximately the same amounts they would have received if the Company had redeemed all public shares in connection with the failure to consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date, and, if the Company is not able to consummate a business combination prior to the Extended Termination Date, its public shareholders at that time would receive approximately the same redemption proceeds as if they had redeemed all public shares in connection with the failure to consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date. However, if material liabilities are sought to be satisfied from the Trust Account, the Trust Account could possibly be reduced or subject to reduction beyond the reduction resulting from public shareholder redemptions, which could result in the reduction of a public shareholder's current pro rata portion of the Trust Account available for distribution. Moreover, attendant litigation could result in delay in the availability of Trust Account funds for use by the Company upon completion of the business combination. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Company is not aware of any such liabilities.
A shareholder's approval of the Trust Amendment will constitute consent to the use of the Company's Trust Account proceeds to pay, at the time the Extension Amendment becomes effective, and in exchange for surrender of shares, pro rata portions of the funds available in the Trust Account to the public shareholders making the Election in lieu of later distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
Possible Claims Against and Impairment of the Trust Account
In considering the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, the Company's shareholders should be aware that if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned), the Company will incur additional expenses in seeking to complete the proposed business combination with Xynomic, in addition to expenses incurred in proposing the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. Our Sponsor has loaned $600,000 in aggregate to the Company, among which, $500,000 is evidenced by two promissory notes issued by the Company. Our Sponsor has also committed to provide an additional $200,000 in loans to the Company. The Company has drawn down the entire $600,000 as of the date of this proxy statement. The notes become due on the date on which the Company consummates a business combination and carry no interest. The principal amount of the notes is convertible, in whole or in part, at the payee's election, upon the consummation of the Business Combination, into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit. These units, once issued pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the promissory notes, will be identical to the private units issued in a private placement in connection with the IPO. If we do not have sufficient funds available to conduct the normal operations of the business or to consummate the proposed business combination, we will need to seek additional working capital from our Sponsor for these purposes. If we consummate an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds or interests on such proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment.
If the Company is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, our Sponsor, Bison Capital, will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to it, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of claims against the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Bison Capital will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that, Bison Capital would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below $10.25 per share and Bison Capital asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine on our behalf whether to take legal action against Bison Capital to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Bison Capital to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations on our behalf, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.25 per share. You should read this proxy statement carefully for more information concerning this possibility and other consequences of the adoption of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
In view of the foregoing, the Company's board of directors believes it in the best interests of the Company's shareholders to approve the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. Automatic Redemption
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not approved and a business combination is not consummated by the Current Termination Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders' rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (less the net interest earned thereon to pay dissolution expenses), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us for payment on taxes due on such funds. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company would expect to pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust fund or available to the Company from interest income on the Trust Account balance.
Redemption Rights
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned), the Company will afford the public shareholders making the Election, the opportunity to receive, at the time the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment become effective, and in exchange for the surrender of their shares, a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. You will also be able to redeem your public shares in connection with the expected shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination with Xynomic, or if the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Termination Date.
If you do not make the Election, you will retain the opportunity to redeem your public shares upon consummation of the proposed business combination with Xynomic, subject to any limitations set forth in the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the limitations contained in the Merger Agreement described below in "The Potential Business Combination with Xynomic" and related agreements. In addition, public shareholders who vote for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment and do not make the Election would be entitled to redemption if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Termination Date.
Redemption Procedure
A redemption demand may be made by checking the box on the proxy card provided for that purpose and returning the proxy card in accordance with the instructions provided, and, at the same time, ensuring your bank or broker complies with the requirements identified elsewhere herein. You will only be entitled to receive cash in connection with a redemption of these shares if you continue to hold them until the effective date of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
In connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you must elect either to physically tender your share certificates to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 1 State Street, 30th Floor, New York, NY 10004-1561, Attn: Mark Zimkind, mzimkind@continentalstock.com, by March 19, 2019, which is two business days prior to the special meeting or to deliver your shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, which election would likely be determined based on the manner in which you hold your shares. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the special meeting ensures that a redeeming holder's Election is irrevocable once the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved. In furtherance of such irrevocable election, shareholders making the Election will not be able to tender their shares at the special meeting.  Through the DWAC system, this electronic delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not it is a record holder or its shares are held in "street name," by contacting the transfer agent or its broker and requesting delivery of its shares through the DWAC system. Delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order to obtain a physical share certificate, a shareholder's broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and the Company's transfer agent will need to act together to facilitate this request. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80 and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. It is the Company's understanding that shareholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical share certificate. Such shareholders will have less time to make their investment decision than those shareholders that do not elect to exercise their redemption rights. Shareholders who request physical share certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.
Certificates that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures by two business days prior to the special meeting will not be redeemed for cash. In the event that a public shareholder tenders its shares and decides prior to the special meeting that it does not want to redeem its shares, the shareholder may withdraw the tender. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to the special meeting not to redeem your shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the address listed above. In the event that a public shareholder tenders shares and the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not approved or is abandoned, these shares will not be redeemed for cash and the physical certificates representing these shares will be returned to the shareholder promptly following the determination that the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment will not be approved or will be abandoned. The Company anticipates that a public shareholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Extension Amendment and execution of the Trust Amendment. The Company will hold the certificates of public shareholders that make the Election until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such shareholders.
If properly demanded, the Company will redeem each public share for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account, calculated as of the record date. As of the record date, this would amount to approximately $10.52 per share. If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your shares for cash and will no longer own the shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption, and tender your share certificate(s) to the Company's transfer agent by two business days prior to the special meeting (or March 19, 2019). If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not approved or if they are abandoned, these shares will not be redeemed for cash. However, if the Company is unable to complete the proposed business combination with Xynomic by the Current Termination Date (unless such date is extended), the shares of the public shareholders will be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum and Articles of Association promptly following such date.
Interests of the Company's Officers, Directors, Advisors and Majority Shareholder
When you consider the recommendation of the Company's board of directors, you should keep in mind that the Company's executive officers, members of the Company's board of directors, the Company's advisors, majority shareholder have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. These interests include, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the fact that Bison Capital  Holding Company Limited as our Sponsor and our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Tong, paid an aggregate purchase price of $25,000,  or approximately $0.017 per share, for their 1,509,375 Founder Shares which would have a value of approximately $15.92 million  based on the closing price of Bison ordinary shares of the Record Date as reported by Nasdaq and that are not subject to redemption.  Such Founder Shares will have no value if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are not approved and the proposed business  combination with Xynomic or an alternative business combination is not consummated by the Current Termination Date; as a result,  our Sponsor (and its members, including our executive officers and directors) have a financial incentive to extend the termination  date in order to consummate a business combination rather than losing whatever value is attributable to the Founder Shares; 
[END TABLE]
The Board's Reasons for the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, its Conclusion, and its Recommendation
As discussed below, after careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Company's board of directors has determined that the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders. The board of directors has approved and declared advisable adoption of the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, and recommends that you vote "FOR" such adoption.
In determining to recommend the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment, the Company's board of directors concluded that the proposed business combination with Xynomic is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, since it believes the Company's shareholders will benefit from that transaction.
The Company believes that given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on the proposed business combination with Xynomic, circumstances warrant providing public shareholders an opportunity to consider the proposed business combination with Xynomic. However, the Company's IPO prospectus stated that if the effect of any proposed amendments to the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, if adopted, would be to delay the date on which a shareholder could otherwise redeem shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account, the Company will provide that, if such amendments are approved by holders of sixty-five percent (65%) or more of the Company's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on such amendments, public shareholders will have the right to redeem their public shares. Accordingly, holders of public shares may elect to redeem their shares in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment regardless of how such public shareholders vote. The Company believes that such redemption right protects the Company's public shareholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable acquisition in the timeframe contemplated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association. However, the Company will not proceed with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001. Having taken into account the matters discussed above, the Company's board of directors believes that, if the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned) and no material liabilities are sought to be satisfied from the Trust Account, any resulting redemptions would have no adverse effect on the public shareholders because they would receive approximately the same amounts they would have received if the Company had redeemed all public shares in connection with the failure to consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date, and, if the Company is not able to consummate a business combination prior to the Extended Termination Date, its public shareholders at that time would receive approximately the same redemption proceeds as if they had redeemed all public shares in connection with the failure to consummate a business combination by the Current Termination Date.
The Company's board of directors has unanimously approved the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment.
In addition, the Company's board of directors was mindful of and took into account the conflicts, as described in "Interests of the Company's Officers, Directors, Advisors and Majority Shareholder", between their respective personal pecuniary interests in successfully completing a business combination and the interests of public shareholders. The board of directors determined that their respective personal pecuniary interests, in the form of the contingent and hypothetical value of Company shares if a business combination is ultimately completed, was substantially less than the additional time, effort and potential liability they might incur if they failed to discharge their fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders to the best of their ability, as well as substantially less than the potential benefits to public shareholders wishing to have an opportunity to consider the proposed business combination with Xynomic, which they, as Company shareholders as well, share.
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Company's board of directors determined that the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, and has declared them advisable.
Recommendation of the Board
The Company's board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
The adjournment proposal, if adopted, will request the chairman of the special meeting (who has agreed to act accordingly) to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to permit further solicitation of proxies. The adjournment proposal will only be presented to our stockholders in the event, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the other proposals in this proxy statement. If the adjournment proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the chairman of the meeting will not exercise his ability to adjourn the special meeting to a later date (which he would otherwise have under the Memorandum and Articles of Association) in the event, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve any of the other proposals.
Required Vote
If a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and voting on the matter at the special meeting vote for the adjournment proposal, the chairman of the special meeting will exercise his or her power to adjourn the meeting as set out above.
Recommendation 
The Company's board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of the Company's ordinary shares as of the record date based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company's ordinary shares, by:
As of the record date, there were a total of 7,978,937 ordinary shares outstanding. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Bison Related Person Transactions
In December 2016, we issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 Founder Shares to our Initial Shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.017 per share. On June 19, 2017, the number of Founder Shares issued under the original subscription agreement was increased by way of the sub-division of each of the then existing Founder Shares on a 1.05 for 1 basis, resulting in the total number of Founder Shares becoming 1,509,375. The Founder Shares are identical to the shares sold in the IPO, except that (1) the Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions as set forth in a certain share escrow agreement, (2) the Founder Shares were purchased pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and will become tradable only after certain conditions are met or the resale of the Founder Shares is registered under the Securities Act, in addition to in accordance with the terms of the share escrow agreement, and (3) the Initial Shareholders have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares in connection with the consummation of Business Combination and (ii) to waive their liquidation rights with respect to their Founder Shares and private shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within March 23, 2019 (the "Combination Period"). All of the Founder Shares were placed in escrow with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent, at the time of our IPO.
Additionally, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Initial Shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Founder Shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until, with respect to 50% of the Founder Shares, the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, and with respect to the remaining 50% of the Founder Shares, upon one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if, subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities, or other property.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, our Sponsor, Bison Capital Holding Company Limited, and EarlyBirdCapital purchased an aggregate of 388,750 private units (or an aggregate purchase price of $3,887,500), of which 362,500 private units were purchased by Bison Capital Holding Company Limited and 26,250 private units were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital. In addition, on June 28, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 43,312 Placement Units at a price of approximately $10.00 per Unit, of which 39,375 private units were purchased by Bison Capital Holding Company Limited and 3,937 private units were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital, generating gross proceeds of $433,125. The proceeds from the sale of the private units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO held in the Trust Account. The private units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that (i) Bison Capital Holding Company Limited and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the private units until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) the private units (including underlying securities) were purchased pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and will become tradable only after certain conditions are met or the resale of the private units is registered under the Securities Act, and (iii) the warrants included in the private units (the "Private Warrants") are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by our Sponsor or EarlyBirdCapital or their permitted transferees. However, the holders have agreed (a) to vote their private shares (representing the ordinary shares underlying the private units) and any public shares in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose or vote in favor of an amendment to the Memorandum and Articles of Association, prior to and unrelated to a Business Combination, to affect the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to redeem all public shares if it cannot complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, unless the Company provides public shareholders an opportunity to redeem their public shares, (c) not to redeem any shares included in the private units (the "Private Shares") into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account or sell their shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination, and (d) not to participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated.
We have agreed to pay our Sponsor $5,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative services, as we may require from time to time. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Beijing area, that the fee charged by our Sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
Other than the $5,000 per-month administrative fee as described above, the $38,400 annual retainer payments to our independent directors as described below and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder's fees, consulting fees, or other similar compensation, will be paid to our Sponsor, officers, directors, or to any of their respective affiliates, prior to or with respect to our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Our independent directors review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors, or our or their affiliates and are responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K, after reviewing each such transaction for potential conflicts of interests and other improprieties.
We pay each of our independent directors an annual retainer of $38,400 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing on the first anniversary of the closing of the IPO and ending on the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation.
Prior to our IPO, our Sponsor advanced to us an aggregate of $159,304 and loaned to us $300,000 to cover expenses related to such offering. We repaid these advances and loan from the proceeds of our IPO not placed in the Trust Account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. As of the date of this proxy statement, our Sponsor has loaned us in aggregate of $600,000 for working capital. Our Sponsor has also committed to provide an additional $200,000 in loans to the Company. The loans would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the Sponsor's discretion, up to $500,000 of the loans that are evidenced by promissory notes, may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000 private shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 private rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of an additional 5,000 private shares upon the Closing, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 private shares). In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds or interest on such proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management, or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.
All ongoing and future transactions between us and any member of our management team or his or her respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us at that time, based upon other similar arrangements known to us, to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. It is our intention to obtain estimates from unaffiliated third parties for similar goods or services to ascertain whether such transactions with affiliates are on terms that are no less favorable to us than are otherwise available from such unaffiliated third parties. If a transaction with an affiliated third party were found to be on terms less favorable to us than with an unaffiliated third party, we would not engage in such transaction.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our public shareholders from a financial point of view.
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement we entered into on June 19, 2017, our Initial Shareholders and EarlyBirdCapital and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the Founder Shares, the private units and underlying securities, and any securities issued upon conversion of working capital loans. The holders of the majority of the Founder Shares are entitled to demand that we register these shares at any time commencing three months prior to the first anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination. The holders of the private units (or underlying securities) are entitled to demand that we register these securities at any time after we consummate our initial business combination. In addition, the holders have certain "piggy-back" registration rights on registration statements filed after the consummation of our initial business combination.
On May 2, 2018, as one of the potential investors of Series B financing, Zhongshan Bison Healthcare Investment Limited (Limited Partnership) ("Zhongshan Bison") entered into an agreement with Xynomic Nanjing. On May 13, 2018, Zhongshan Bison made an advance of RMB9,435,000 (equivalent to US$1,425,959) to fund the operations and business development of Xynomic Nanjing. Zhongshan Bison is entitled to withdraw the advance within 5 business days after Zhongshan Bison paid the first investment of Series B financing, or if current shareholders and investors fail to subscribe shares of the Series B financing within 6 months.
On June 4, 2018, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with certain investors (including Zhongshan Bison), pursuant to which a total of 5,281,101 Convertible Series B Preferred Shares ("Series B Preferred Shares") were to be issued for an aggregated cash consideration of US$17,000,000. On August 16, 2018, the Series B Preferred Shares were issued and the US$17,000,000 were received.
On August 16, 2018, Zhongshan Bison became one of the Series B Preferred Shareholders.
On August 23, 2018, the Company entered into a termination agreement for the advance from Zhongshan Bison. The Company is required to a) repay RMB1,800,000 of the advance from Zhongshan Bison within 2 days after signing the agreement; and b) repay the remaining RMB7,635,000 of the advance from Zhongshan Bison and interest accrued at annual interest rate of 8% from signing the engagement agreement within six months from the date of the termination agreement.
On August 23, 2018, the Company repaid RMB1,800,000 (equivalent to US$262,743) of the advance from Zhongshan Bison. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2018, the advance from Zhongshan Bison was nil and US$1,109,867, respectively.
Zhongshan Bison is holding 1,553,265 shares of Series B preferred stock of Xynomic representing approximately 2.96% equity interest in Xynomic immediately prior to the Closing. Mr. Peixin Xu, the Chairman of Bison, is the beneficial owner of 21% of Zhongshan Bison and his wife owns 100% of Sponsor. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
