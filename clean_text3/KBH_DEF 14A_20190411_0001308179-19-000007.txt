RETURN ON EQUITY
Together with the Board of Directors and the management team of KB Home, I am pleased to invite you to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on Thursday, April 11, 2019, at our Corporate Office, which is located at 10990 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.
2018 IN REVIEW
The KB Home team achieved several significant milestones in 2018.  We delivered solid financial results, as we increased our scale and, together with the growth in our revenues, meaningfully improved our profitability and returns, as well as reduced our debt to capital ratio — all central components of our Returns-Focused Growth Plan.  We also repositioned our brand, launching a new logo and "Built on Relationships" tagline to underscore the value we place on our relationships with homebuyers, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners, and each other.  While the values underlying our brand remain true to the principles we have had since our founding, we modernized the look and feel of our brand to better represent who we are today.  And finally, we continued to earn recognition for our leadership in sustainable homebuilding, with an emphasis on resource-efficient, healthier and technology-enabled homes.
In 2018, which was the second year of our three-year Returns-Focused Growth Plan, we continued to deliver strong performance, having achieved or exceeded most of the Plan's targets a year early.  We expanded our total revenues to over $4.5 billion and grew our homebuilding operating income margin by 120 basis points to 8.3%, excluding inventory-related charges.  The combined effect of increasing our scale and measurably improving our profitability drove a 27% increase in our pretax income to nearly $370 million.  And, excluding the non-cash accounting charge related to federal tax legislation, we also made considerable progress in our key returns metrics, with our return on invested capital increasing by 300 basis points to 10.4% and return on equity improving 440 basis points to 14.4%.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Returns-Focused Growth Plan Financial Targets  2018 Results     2019 Target  
Housing revenues  $4.5 billion     > $5.0 billion  
Homebuilding operating income margin (a)  8.3%   8.0% to 9.0%  
Return on invested capital (b)  10.4%   > 10.0%  
Return on equity (b)  14.4%   10.0% to 15.0%  
Net debt to capital ratio (c)  41.6%  35.0% to 45.0%  
[END TABLE]
Excludes inventory-related charges.
The 2018 metrics exclude the impact from the non-cash charge of $112.5 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
In the 2018 fourth quarter, we lowered our net debt to capital ratio target to a range of 35.0% to 45.0% from the original 2019 target range of 40.0% to 50.0%.
At the heart of our Returns-Focused Growth Plan is our ability to generate substantial levels of cash flow and to allocate this capital in a balanced way to both fuel profitable growth and reduce our debt.  We delivered on these goals in 2018 by generating considerable operating cash that enabled us to invest approximately $1.9 billion in land acquisition and development, retire $300 million of our senior notes and return about $44 million in cash to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.  At the end of our fiscal year, we had over $1 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $575 million in cash.  The solid execution of our Plan drove year-over-year progress in our leverage ratios, as we ended the fiscal year with a debt to capital ratio of 49.7% (a 500-basis point improvement) and net debt to capital ratio of 41.6% (a 380-basis point improvement), with the latter firmly within our lowered target range of 35% to 45% for 2019.
In 2018, we entered the Seattle market with a start-up division.  We have been evaluating this market for several years and saw an opening to offer more affordable product, in the high $300,000 to $400,000 price range, in keeping with our strategy to be positioned below the median new home price, which is approximately $550,000 in Seattle.  With a small local team in place, we are planning for our first deliveries in 2019 and excited about the opportunity to expand our West Coast business.
The factors supporting housing demand remained generally favorable in 2018, as the economy expanded, jobs and wages grew, and new households continued to form.  At the same time, supply remained low, with existing home inventory at a 3.7-month supply in December 2018 across the U.S., and below that level in many of our served markets.  It is this backdrop that gives us reason to remain encouraged about the year ahead, even as heightened affordability pressures driven by several years of home price appreciation coupled with rising mortgage interest rates caused consumers to pause on their purchases of new homes in the latter part of 2018.
We believe the flexibility of our Built-to-Order™ model is a competitive advantage that enabled us to move quickly to respond to these affordability concerns.  We began repositioning our product offerings in many of our existing communities, as well as upcoming grand openings, by adding smaller square footage plans selected from our existing plan series and repositioning model parks to demonstrate the expanded range of more affordable choices.  In addition, we also began lowering the specification levels for our standard features within many of our communities, leveraging our Design Studio to showcase buyers' options and educate them on both standard and upgraded features.
For additional details on our 2018 performance, our outlook for our 2019 first quarter and related business risk factors, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2018.
SUSTAINABILITY AND INNOVATION
We take a broad approach to sustainability, encompassing energy efficiency, water conservation, healthier indoor environments, smart home capabilities and waste reduction. In 2018, we continued our longstanding industry leadership in this area, which is grounded in making homeownership more affordable for our buyers and better for the environment.  The 115,000+ ENERGY STAR homes that we have built over an 18-year period have collectively saved our homeowners an estimated $658 million in utility bills and reduced CO2 emissions by an estimated 4 billion pounds—the equivalent of removing 382,000 cars from the road.
Our accomplishments in this area were recognized with two key industry-first honors, including eight consecutive ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year —
Sustained Excellence Awards and four consecutive WaterSense® Sustained Excellence Awards. In addition, we earned an ENERGY STAR Certified Homes Market Leader Award in each of our primary markets—20 in total for 2018—reflecting our leadership in building homes that meet ENERGY STAR efficiency standards.
Another area that we are dedicated to is integrating technology into our homes and one of our key initiatives in 2018 was launching the KB Smart Home System featuring Google Assistant™. This first-in-the-industry partnership with Google® allows homeowners to control the functionality of their smart home features and automate routines to their individual preferences. The Smart Home System was a central component of our KB Home ProjeKt concept home, located in our Inspirada community in Las Vegas, which we unveiled earlier this year. This full-scale concept home showcased how smart and sustainable technology can be leveraged to offer personalized convenience and wellness features.
IN CLOSING
We are continuing to make solid progress on our Returns-Focused Growth Plan, as we have grown into a larger and significantly more profitable company with a stronger balance sheet.  We believe we are well positioned for 2019, with significant growth expected in our community count, and compelling products that are designed to maximize affordability and choice for our buyers.  We remain committed to increasing stockholder value and thank you for your continued support of KB Home.  We hope to see you at our Annual Meeting.
Sincerely,

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Mr. Mezger, our CEO, has served as Chairman of the Board since 2016. The non-employee directors of the Board have elected Mr. Mezger as Chairman based on his fundamental understanding of our business model, effective operational leadership and capable service as a director since 2006, and their belief that combining the roles of Chairman and CEO enhances our ability to achieve our long-term growth goals. Board governance is balanced with a strong Lead Independent Director position, which is designed to maintain the Board's firm independent oversight of our business. Ms. Lora has served as Lead Independent Director since 2016.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of our directors or executive officers had any relationship that would constitute a "compensation committee interlock" under SEC rules.
  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT     7

The subjects included, among others, Board/committee structure, composition, diversity, skills, meeting processes, interaction with management, and performance of the Board Chairman/committee chair and the Lead Independent Director. Each committee reported on the results of its own assessment to the full Board.

BOARD ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board oversees our management's plans, policies and processes for identifying, assessing and addressing business risks while advancing our strategic growth goals. The Board has delegated risk oversight responsibilities to its committees, as described below. At each in-person Board meeting, the chair of each committee reports on the risks their committee has discussed with management, as well as their committee's other activities.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit                                                                                                                                                                               Committee     The Audit Committee oversees our management's performance of an annual enterprise risk management assessment that identifies significant risks in our business and operations based on probability, impact and mitigating factors. This assessment's outcome drives our internal audit department's activities, the results of which are provided at the committee's quarterly meetings and upon request. The committee also monitors cybersecurity risks and our evolving physical, electronic and other protection strategies and initiatives, with the lead responsible executive periodically reporting to the committee. Further, at each of its regular meetings, the committee receives reports from our senior finance, accounting, legal and internal audit executives, and conducts separate executive sessions with each of those executives and with our Independent Auditor to discuss matters relevant to their respective duties and roles, including risk areas.   
Compensation                                                                                                                                                                               Committee     The Compensation Committee oversees an annual employee compensation risk assessment performed by FWC together with our management that largely focuses on potential policy and program design and implementation risks. The committee also annually reviews our compliance with our equity-based award grant policy, and our workforce development and management succession planning (both short- and long-term) for all levels of our organization. In addition, the committee reviews and, as appropriate, approves the compensation arrangements developed by our senior human resources department personnel. Based on this oversight approach, including the results of our most recent annual risk assessment, we do not believe that risks arising from our present employee compensation policies and programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.  
Nominating                                                                                                                                                                               Committee     The Nominating Committee oversees risks relating to corporate governance, including assessing potential related party transactions, as well as evaluating the current mix of skills and experience of the Board and of potential director candidates. The committee also reviews updates to our core governance policies and documents based on input from management and recommends changes to the full Board.

Equity Grant (grant date fair value):  $145,000

Meeting Fees:  $1,500   (per applicable meeting, as described below)  
[END TABLE]
The Board set the above compensation levels in October 2014, except the Lead Independent Director retainer (which was set in August 2016).  Directors elected to the Board other than at an annual meeting receive prorated compensation.
RETAINERS
Each director may elect to receive their retainers in equal quarterly cash installments, in unrestricted shares of our common stock and/or in fully vested deferred common stock awards ("stock units"), with any such equity-based grants made as described below. Committee retainer differences reflect relative workloads.
EQUITY GRANT
Each director may generally elect to receive their equity grant in shares of our common stock and/or in stock units. Such grants are made on election to the Board, with the rounded number of shares/units granted based on our common stock's closing price on the grant date. Directors will receive a share of our common stock for each stock unit they hold on the earlier of a change in control or leaving the Board. Directors receive cash dividends on their common stock holdings, and cash dividend equivalent payments on their stock units. Stock units have no voting rights. If a director has not satisfied his or her stock ownership requirement by the applicable time (as described under "Stock Ownership Requirements"), the director can only receive stock units for the equity grant and cannot dispose of any shares of our common stock until the director satisfies the ownership requirement or leaves the Board.
MEETING FEES
These fees are payable to directors who attend any non-regularly scheduled Board or committee meeting and have also attended each of the Board's or the applicable committee's prior meetings in a specified 12-month period. No such fees were paid in 2018. 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS
We have agreements with our directors that provide them with indemnification and advancement of expenses to supplement what our Certificate of Incorporation and insurance policies provide, subject to certain limitations.
DIRECTORS' LEGACY PROGRAM
We established a Directors' Legacy Program in 1995 to recognize our and our directors' interests in supporting educational institutions and other charitable organizations. The Board closed the program to new participants in 2007, and Messrs. Finchem and Jastrow and Ms. Lora are the only current directors who are participants. All program participants have fully vested in their donation amount; however, neither they nor their families receive any proceeds, compensation or tax savings associated with the program. Under the program, after a participant's death, we will make a charitable donation on each participant's behalf of up to $1 million directly to up to five participant-designated qualifying institutions or organizations in ten equal annual installments. We maintain life insurance policies to help fund these donations, but no premium payments for the policies were required to be made in 2018. The total amount payable under the program at November 30, 2018 was $14.8 million.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board will present as nominees at the Annual Meeting, and recommends our stockholders elect to the Board, each of the individuals named below for a one-year term ending at the election of directors at our 2020 annual meeting. Each nominee has consented to being nominated, is standing for re-election and has agreed to serve as a director if elected. Should any of the nominees become unable to serve as a director prior to the Annual Meeting, the named proxies, unless otherwise directed, may vote for the election of another person as the Board may recommend. If the Board's nominees are elected at the Annual Meeting, the Board will have ten directors. While there are no term limits for directors, a director must retire from the Board as of the first annual meeting following their 75th birthday.
VOTING STANDARD
To be elected, each nominee must receive a majority of votes cast in favor (i.e., the votes cast for a nominee's election must exceed the votes cast against their election).

  BOARD                                              RECOMMENDATION: FOR APPROVAL OF EACH DIRECTOR NOMINEE  
[END TABLE]
DIRECTOR RESIGNATION POLICY
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that a director nominee who fails to win election to the Board in an uncontested election is expected to tender his or her resignation from the Board (or to have previously submitted a conditional tender). An "uncontested election" is one in which there is no director nominee that has been nominated by a stockholder in accordance with our By-Laws. This election is an uncontested election. If an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for election in an uncontested election, the Nominating Committee will act promptly to determine whether to accept the director's resignation and will submit its recommendation for the Board's consideration. The Board expects the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain from participating in any decision on that resignation. The Nominating Committee and the Board may consider any relevant factors in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation.

The GSOT's percent of class figure is relative to the total number of shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, as described under "Annual Meeting Voting Matters and Other Information." The GSOT holds these shares pursuant to a trust agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as trustee. Both the GSOT and the trustee disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares. Under the trust agreement, our employees who hold unexercised common stock options under our employee equity compensation plans determine the voting of the GSOT shares. Employees who are also directors cannot vote GSOT shares; therefore, Mr. Mezger cannot direct the vote of any GSOT shares. If all eligible employees submit voting instructions, our other NEOs can direct the vote of the following amounts of GSOT shares: Mr. Kaminski 841,439; Mr. Mandino 177,281;Mr. Praw 596,010; Mr. Woram 1,181,342; and all current executive officers as a group (excluding Mr. Mezger) 2,796,072. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
Our non-employee directors and senior executives are subject to stock ownership requirements to better align their interests with those of our stockholders. Our Corporate Governance Principles require each of our non-employee directors to own at least five times the Board retainer (currently $500,000) in value of our common stock or common stock equivalents by the fifth anniversary of joining the Board (the non-employee directors serving on the Board on October 9, 2014 must meet the ownership threshold by the fifth anniversary of that date). The executive stock ownership policy requires designated senior executives, including our NEOs, to own a certain number of shares within a specified period. The policy is discussed under "Equity Stock Ownership Policy." Each of our non-employee directors and NEOs is in compliance with their respective policy requirements.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Based solely on written representations furnished to us from reporting persons and our review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and any amendments thereto furnished to us, we believe all such Forms required to be filed during 2018 under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, were filed on a timely basis by our reporting persons.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS
In our 2018 fiscal year, we produced strong financial and operational results, extending our considerable growth over the last three years.
RETURNS-FOCUSED GROWTH PLAN FINANCIAL RESULTS
Since 2016, we have implemented a Returns-Focused Growth Plan that is designed to generate higher revenues and improvement in our homebuilding operating income margin, return on invested capital, return on equity and leverage ratio, and to achieve certain financial targets for these metrics in 2019. Since first implementing the plan, we have made significant progress toward achieving our aggressive 2019 financial targets, as shown in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]
For the Year-Ended November 30,   2019 Targets  2018  2017  2016  
Housing revenues   >$5.0 billion  $4.5 billion  $4.3 billion  $3.6 billion  
Homebuilding operating income margin, excluding inventory-related charges  8.0% to 9.0%  8.3%  7.1%  5.7%  
Return on invested capital*  >10.0%  10.4%  7.4%  5.2%  
Return on equity*  10.0% to 15.0%  14.4%  10.0%  6.3%  
Net debt to capital ratio**  35.0% to 45.0%  41.6%  45.4%  54.3%  
[END TABLE]
The 2018 ratios exclude the impact of the above-described TCJA-related charge.
In the 2018 fourth quarter, we lowered our net debt to capital ratio target to a range of 35.0% to 45.0% from an original 2019 target range of 40.0% to 50.0%.
TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN
Our annualized total stockholder return ("TSR"), including reinvestment of dividends, over the last three years, as set forth below, ranks at the top of our peer group:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Annualized   2018  2017  2016  
TSR  15.0%  -32.4%  98.9%  13.3%  
[END TABLE]
We believe our significant progress towards achieving our Returns-Focused Growth Plan targets is reflected in our three-year TSR ranking at the top of our peer group.  As with all of our peer group members, during a volatile year for our industry, our 2018 one-year TSR was negative. However, in the context of our business and its typical cycles, we generally consider longer-term measurement periods of TSR as more indicative of performance. Our five-year TSR performance exceeded the peer group median, and, as stated above, our three-year TSR performance placed us first in our peer group.

PAY FOR PERFORMANCE – 2018 FISCAL YEAR CEO COMPENSATION 
90% of our CEO's 2018 compensation was performance-based and his base salary did not increase.
Our CEO's annual incentive award of $6.44 million was performance-driven, determined pursuant to a formula-based plan typical of several of our peers, and reflected our profitability growth and improved asset efficiency in 2018.
100% of our CEO's long-term incentives were performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs").
Our CEO earned his three-year 2015 PSU award at 167% of target (as discussed under "2015 PSU Awards"), based on our achieving maximum results for two of the three performance measures (both as adjusted for the above-described TCJA-related charge). 
LISTENING TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
In 2018, we continued our longstanding practice of reaching out to our stockholders, including all of our 25 largest stockholders, and we directly engaged with holders representing over 50% of our outstanding shares ahead of our 2018 annual meeting.
In evaluating our executive compensation programs during 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the strong support stockholders have expressed through our annual NEO compensation advisory votes over the past few years for our approach to executive compensation, including a 91.5% level of approval at our 2018 annual meeting. As a result, for 2018, the Compensation Committee decided to retain the core components of our executive compensation programs and to apply the same general principles and philosophy as in the prior fiscal year in its executive compensation decisions. In our discussions, stockholders reacted favorably not only to our compensation programs, but also to the changes our Compensation Committee approved in 2017 regarding change in control provisions in our equity award agreements and its adoption in 2018 of an executive officer incentive compensation claw-back policy. 
COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE
[BEGIN TABLE]
What We Do     What We Don't Do  
  Engage with and consider stockholder input in designing our executive pay programs.       No re-pricing or cash-out of underwater stock options without stockholder approval.  
  Link annual NEO incentive pay to objective, pre-established financial performance goals, which are three-year goals for long-term incentives.       Prohibit our NEOs (and our other employees and non-employee directors) from hedging or pledging their holdings of our securities.  
  Grant all of our NEOs' long-term incentives in performance-based restricted stock units.       No new excise tax "gross-ups" for any officer or employee.  
  Beginning with 2017 awards, employee equity award agreements require double-trigger vesting in a change in control.        Restrict, without stockholder approval, new severance arrangements with executive officers, as described under  "Severance Arrangements."  
  Subject our executive officers to an incentive compensation claw-back policy.       No payments of dividends or dividend equivalents on performance-based equity awards before they vest.  
  Perform, under Compensation Committee oversight, annual risk assessments to determine that our employee compensation policies and programs are not likely to have a material adverse effect on us.       Avoid excessive perquisites.  Perquisites are generally limited to market-competitive medical benefits and the opportunity to participate in a deferred compensation plan.  
  Engage, at the sole direction of the Compensation Committee, an independent compensation consultant.           
  Maintain robust stock ownership requirements for  all NEOs.           
  Maintain a relevant industry peer group.

As outlined above, we place a significant emphasis on at-risk, performance-based pay. As shown below, in 2018, our CEO received 90% of his total direct compensation (i.e., value of base salary and annual and long-term incentives) in performance-based and/or at-risk vehicles. For our other NEOs, such vehicles made up, on average, over 80% of their total direct compensation.

NEO COMPENSATION COMPONENTS
BASE SALARIES 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the base salaries of our CEO and our other NEOs. The Compensation Committee approves NEO base salaries after considering several factors, including an NEO's experience, specific responsibilities, capabilities, individual performance and expected future contributions; our current and expected financial and operational results; and market pay levels and trends to ensure competitiveness. In July 2018, based on an evaluation of these factors, our growth trajectory and our CEO's recommendations, the Compensation Committee approved base salary increases for each NEO other than Mr. Mandino, who was promoted in June, and our CEO, who last received an increase in 2017, his first in 10 years.  
2018 ANNUAL INCENTIVES
Our CEO's annual incentive award of $6.44 million was performance-driven, determined pursuant to a formula-based plan typical of several of our peers, and reflected our profitability growth and improved asset efficiency in 2018.
Our annual incentive program is structured to drive performance within a single fiscal year period. As with our 2015 – 2017 programs, if we generated total adjusted pretax income ("API") of at least $100 million, the 2018 program's formula-driven funding would be determined based on two components: (a) API performance relative to threshold and target goals set relative to then-expected market and business conditions in 2018; and (b) API performance relative to an asset efficiency measure. API is our total pretax income excluding certain compensation expense and certain inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges.
We view API as a comprehensive short-term measure of our senior officers' performance, as it reflects their ability to generate profits by growing revenues, managing expenses and controlling fixed costs. The combination of the API and asset efficiency measures was designed to motivate our senior officers to generate profitable growth in alignment with the goals of our Returns-Focused Growth Plan.
The 2018 target payout opportunities were set at 150% of base salary for our CEO, 120% for our COO and 100% for the remainder of our NEOs. As outlined in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards During Fiscal Year 2018 table, maximum payouts were limited to a multiple of target. The target and maximum annual incentive opportunities were designed to generate payout levels that, if achieved, would appropriately reward strong performance for 2018, and together with base salary and long-term incentives, provide competitive total direct compensation.
2018 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM COMPONENT DETERMINATIONS 
Because our 2018 API exceeded $100 million, our NEOs became eligible to receive annual incentive payouts based on our performance under the 2018 program.
API Performance Relative to Goals Component
The Compensation Committee set a challenging API performance target of $365.0 million, an increase over our actual 2017 API performance. Under the 2018 program, the Compensation Committee limited potential payouts under this component to no more than the NEOs' individual target amounts, even if our actual API exceeded the target performance level. This was done to ensure that our NEOs focused on advancing both program components — pretax income and asset efficiency — to be able to earn more than their target annual incentive amount under the program as a whole.
We achieved API of $449.9 million in 2018, which was a significant 26% year-over-year increase in API. As explained above and shown in the table below, this performance led to strictly formula-based payouts of 100% of target to our NEOs under the API performance component.
2018 API PERFORMANCE LEVELS AND PAYOUT SUMMARY
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Threshold  Target  Actual Result  
API Performance Levels  $273.8 million  $365.0 million  $449.9 million

Back to Contents
Our NEOs could earn annual incentive payouts above their respective individual target payout levels (but limited to each such officer's respective maximum payout level) only if and to the extent our API performance exceeded a minimum asset efficiency objective, as described below.
API Performance Relative to Asset Efficiency Component
Under this component, two percent of each dollar of API over our minimum asset efficiency objective, and three percent of each dollar of API above the level of 110% of that target, funded an additional annual incentive pool to be allocated among the participating officers. The Compensation Committee set the 2018 minimum asset efficiency objective at a one percent return on inventory for 2018, which was approximately $34.2 million. With the difference between our API and the minimum asset efficiency objective equal to about $415.7 million, the asset efficiency performance pool was funded at a total level of approximately $8.8 million.
The Compensation Committee determined the allocation of the asset efficiency performance pool based on pre-established potential payout ranges (0% — 60% for our CEO; 0% — 12% for our other NEOs) that took into consideration each officer's 2018 annual incentive payout opportunities at threshold, target and maximum levels; historical relative annual incentive payouts by functional role; and competitive market pay information. In determining allocations of the pool to our NEOs, the Compensation Committee also considered each NEOs' individual performance contributions, which, other than for our CEO, were informed by our CEO's assessment of their performance, and established a corresponding individual performance factor ("IPF") within the above-described ranges. The Compensation Committee determined our CEO's award by also considering the CEO's leadership of our strategy and his significant contribution to the considerable growth of our business in 2018. The table below summarizes our NEOs' individual performance contributions.

2019 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
The 2019 annual incentive program will be similar to our 2018 program, including a formula-driven funding structure determined by API and asset efficiency performance measures. The pre-established 2019 threshold and target performance levels are programatically in line with the prior year's levels based on expected market and business conditions for the year.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
In October 2018, the Compensation Committee approved long-term incentive awards to our NEOs consisting solely of PSUs to reinforce the alignment of pay with our performance and stockholder value creation. Prior to 2017, long-term incentive awards to our NEOs included stock options and, except for our CEO, shares of restricted common stock. Regardless of the mix of vehicles awarded, the overall grant date fair value of long-term incentive awards to our NEOs, other than Mr. Mandino, who is a new NEO, has been essentially flat over the past four years.

We have granted PSUs to our executive officers each year since 2012. As with prior PSU grants, the PSUs granted in 2018 are designed to focus our executive officers on achieving important long-term financial objectives over a three-year period. The 2018 PSU measures described below are a combination of absolute and relative metrics that should generate positive outcomes for our business, are aligned with our Returns-Focused Growth Plan objectives, and, if achieved, are expected to be strong drivers of stockholder value creation.

For our 2018 grants, we increased the weight of the AROIC measure from 20% to 35% to reflect our strategic emphasis on increasing our returns and to better align with stockholder interests.
The 2018 PSU amounts shown in the table above reflect a target award of shares of our common stock and their grant date fair value. Each 2018 PSU entitles a recipient to a grant of 0% to 200% of his target award depending on our performance relative to the above-noted performance measures over the three-year period of December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2021. The AEPS and AROIC measures' performance will be determined on a tax-effected basis that excludes only pre-specified categories of compensation expense; certain inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges; and other extraordinary items approved by the Compensation Committee. As with prior PSU grants, upon vesting, each 2018 PSU recipient is entitled to receive a proportionate amount of credited cash dividends that are paid in respect of one share of our common stock with a record date between the grant date and the date the Compensation Committee determines the applicable performance achievements, if any. Except for death, disability or certain retirement circumstances, a recipient will forfeit any rights to a 2018 PSU payout if the recipient terminates service before the date the Compensation Committee determines the applicable performance achievements.

As with our annual incentive program, the Compensation Committee established the threshold performance levels outlined above to be reasonably achievable, yet uncertain to be met under expected market and business conditions at the time of grant. Target performance levels are designed to require significant management effort to achieve, and maximum performance levels are designed to be measurably more difficult to achieve than target performance levels. Each of these performance levels directly scale to threshold, target and maximum payout opportunities.
As vesting for the PSUs granted in 2016–2018 will not be determined until after their respective performance periods end, we cannot predict the extent to which any shares under these awards will ultimately vest.

The cumulative AEPS performance result for the 2015 PSUs exceeded the challenging $4.36 maximum goal level and reflected our emphasis on and success at growing our diluted earnings per share by 232% over a three-year period amid an improving housing market. Strong, consistent profitability and cumulative net income of more than $456 million over this period contributed to a significant increase in our adjusted return on invested capital over the same three-year span, exceeding our maximum goal for this measure. The relative revenue growth performance for the 2015 PSUs reflected our 50% revenue growth over the applicable period, a result that placed us sixth within the peer group. During the performance period, two of the peer companies that were part of the original peer group for this performance measure ceased to exist due to multiple mergers. Our ranking in the table above reflects our position at the end of the performance period among the post-mergers peer group, consistent with the terms of the 2015 PSUs, and based on the relative revenue growth performance rank-to-target award multiplier table above. All of these outcomes were uncertain at the time the 2015 PSUs were granted, and the Compensation Committee determined that they required significant management effort to achieve and sustain through the entirety of the performance period.
On February 14, 2019, the Compensation Committee certified the performance we achieved for the period ending November 30, 2018 and approved share grants with respect to the 2015 PSUs as set forth in the table below. Mr. Mandino was not a participant in the 2015 PSU program.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND POLICIES
The Compensation Committee oversees the decision-making process for our executive compensation and benefits policies and programs. In making executive compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considers a variety of factors and data, most importantly our performance and individual executives' performance, and the totality of compensation that may be paid. Among the data the Compensation Committee considers are financial and operational performance metrics for us, including comparisons to prior years' performance and our current business plans and to our peer group; surveys and forecasts of comparative general industry and peer group compensation and benefits practices; and, at least annually, management-prepared tally sheets for senior executives with up to six years of compensation data.
ROLE OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS
Our CEO and senior human resources and legal department executives and FWC provide information and recommendations to assist the Compensation Committee's decision-making, and also advise on compliance and disclosure requirements. FWC, which the Compensation Committee directly retains, attends Compensation Committee meetings as needed. To maintain its independence and avoid any conflicts of interest, FWC may not work directly for our management unless the Compensation Committee pre-approves the work, including fees. During 2018, FWC did not provide any services that would have required such pre-approval. Based on its consideration of factors under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards, the Compensation Committee determined that FWC's work did not raise any conflicts of interest, and therefore considered FWC to be independent.
PEER GROUP
Our peer group is composed solely of public companies that, like us, are engaged in high production homebuilding as their primary business. We compete with all of these companies for both homebuyers and management talent. The competition with these companies for human resources reflects our, and their, need to attract and retain high caliber management and other personnel with strong high production homebuilding expertise and experience to execute business activities nationally as well as in specific local markets. Therefore, a principal focus in designing our compensation and benefits programs is to meet this critical competitive need.
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with FWC and our management, periodically reviews and considers changes to our peer group. The Compensation Committee principally considers the competitive factors described above, as well as relative total revenues and market capitalization among the peer group companies. The Compensation Committee last adjusted our peer group during 2016, the members of which are shown below (exclusive of peers since acquired by other peers). As of their most recently filed proxy statements before the date of this Proxy Statement, each member of our peer group included us in its own peer group.
OUR PEER GROUP
Beazer Homes USA, Inc.
Lennar Corporation
NVR, Inc.
Toll Brothers, Inc.
D.R. Horton, Inc.
M.D.C. Holdings, Inc.
PulteGroup, Inc.
TRI Pointe Group, Inc.
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.
Meritage Homes Corporation
Taylor Morrison Home Corporation
As of December 31, 2018, the reported total revenues (on a trailing 12-month basis) of the companies in our peer group were within a range of approximately 0.4 to 4.5 times our total revenues, and our total revenues approximated the median of the peer group. Also, as of December 31, 2018, the market capitalization of our peer group was within a range of approximately 0.1 to 6.8 times our market capitalization, and our market capitalization approximated the median of the peer group.

EQUITY STOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY
Our longstanding executive stock ownership policy is intended to encourage, and has encouraged, our executives to increase their ownership of our common stock over time and to align their interests with our stockholders' interests. Under the policy, designated senior executives are expected to achieve specific levels of common stock ownership within five years of joining us or being promoted to a position with a higher ownership guideline and, once achieved, maintain such ownership throughout their employment with us. The targeted common stock ownership levels for our NEOs are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive  Ownership Guideline  
Mr. Mezger  6.0 times base salary  
Mr. Mandino   3.0 times base salary  
Messrs. Kaminski, Praw and Woram   2.0 times base salary  
[END TABLE]
Common stock ownership includes shares directly owned by the NEO, and shares are valued at the greater of the most recent closing price on a valuation date and the closing price on the date shares are acquired. Designated executives are required to hold all vested net (after-tax) shares of time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted stock and up to 100% of net shares acquired through stock option exercises until their applicable stock ownership guideline is met, absent a hardship or other qualified exception. Each of our NEOs is in compliance with the requirements of the policy.
PROHIBITION ON HEDGING/PLEDGING OF OUR SECURITIES
To further align their interests with those of our stockholders, our employees and non-employee directors cannot engage in short sales of our securities and cannot buy or sell puts, calls or any other financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset decreases or increases in the value of our securities (including derivatives, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds). They also cannot hold our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledge our securities as collateral for any loan.
EQUITY-BASED AWARD GRANT POLICY
Our equity-based award grant policy governs the timing and establishes certain internal controls over the grant of equity-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock and PSUs. The policy requires that the Compensation Committee (or the Board) approve all grants of equity-based awards and their terms, and does not permit delegation of this authority to our management. Per the policy, the exercise or grant price of any relevant equity-based award cannot be less than the closing price of our common stock on the grant date.
CLAW-BACK POLICY
The Board adopted a policy in January 2018 to recoup compensation if our financial statements must be restated due to an executive officer's intentional misconduct or grossly negligent conduct. Under the policy, the Board (or a designated committee) can, to the extent permitted by applicable law (including California law), require an officer to reimburse or forfeit to us the excess bonus or incentive compensation (whether cash- or equity-based) such officer received during the three fiscal years preceding the year the restatement is determined to be required relative to an applicable restated performance measure or target. In addition, our CEO must repay certain bonus and incentive- or equity-based compensation he receives if we are required to restate our financial statements as a result of his misconduct consistent with Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We will also recoup incentive-based compensation from our NEOs to the extent required under the Dodd-Frank Act and any rules issued under that Act.
TAX IMPLICATIONS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
In past years, including for our 2018 fiscal year, we have generally designed our incentive compensation plans in order to maintain federal tax deductibility for executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and the Compensation Committee considered the potential Section 162(m) impact when 
  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT     30
Back to Contents approving the compensation paid to our NEOs. Prior to the TCJA, Section 162(m) generally disallowed a tax deduction for compensation over $1.0 million paid to certain executive officers unless it qualified as performance-based compensation. The TCJA effectively repealed the exemption for performance-based compensation with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, other than for arrangements in place on November 2, 2017 that are not later modified in any material respect. As such, with respect to our 2019 fiscal year, we will not be able to deduct compensation above $1.0 million awarded to certain of our executive officers. While we intend for our 2018 annual incentives and PSU grants made prior to November 2, 2017 to qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m), we cannot guarantee that any compensation intended to be deductible under Section 162(m) will qualify as such. In addition, the Compensation Committee will approve compensation that may not be deductible under Section 162(m) where it believes it is in our and our stockholders' best interests to do so.
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS
We have entered into agreements with each NEO and certain other senior executives that provide them with indemnification and advancement of expenses to supplement what our Certificate of Incorporation and insurance policies provide, subject to certain limitations.
SEVERANCE, CHANGE IN CONTROL AND POST-TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS 
SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS
Mr. Mezger's Employment Agreement and our Executive Severance Plan, in which all of our NEOs participate, provide certain severance benefits, as discussed under "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control." In considering our stockholders' approval of an advisory proposal, in 2008 we adopted a policy under which we will obtain stockholder approval before paying severance benefits to an executive officer under a future severance arrangement in excess of 2.99 times the sum of the executive officer's then-current base salary and target bonus. Future severance arrangements do not include arrangements existing when we adopted the policy or that we assume or acquire unless, in each case, any such arrangement is changed in a manner that materially increases its severance benefits.
CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
Since 2001, we have maintained but have not modified the terms of a Change in Control Severance Plan ("CIC Plan") that provides participants with certain benefits and accelerated equity award vesting, as discussed under "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control." The CIC Plan is intended to enable and encourage our management to focus its attention on obtaining the best possible result for our stockholders in a change in control, to promote management continuity, and to provide income protection if there is an involuntary loss of employment. Beginning with 2017 awards, employee equity award agreements require double-trigger vesting in a change in control.
DEATH BENEFITS
Our Death Benefit Only Plan, in which Messrs. Mezger and Praw participate, provides a $1.0 million death benefit to a participant's designated beneficiary (plus an additional tax restoration amount sufficient to pay taxes on the benefit and the additional amount). We closed the plan to new participants beginning in 2006. Only term life insurance, with a $750,000 benefit level, has been made available to incoming eligible executives, including Messrs. Kaminski, Mandino and Woram. We also maintain a $400,000 life insurance death benefit for designated beneficiaries of Mr. Mezger.
OTHER BENEFITS
The majority of our health and welfare benefits are made available to all full-time employees, including our NEOs. During 2018, as in prior years, our NEOs were eligible to participate in a supplemental plan that reimburses them for qualified out-of-pocket expenses that exceed amounts payable under our standard medical, dental and vision plans. Certain of our NEOs, and other employees, also participate in our unfunded nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP"). These market-competitive benefits are offered to attract and retain key executive talent.

RETIREMENT PROGRAMS
The 401(k) Plan, a qualified defined contribution plan, is the only post-employment benefit program we offer to all full-time employees.  We provide a dollar-for-dollar match of 401(k) Plan and DCP contributions on up to an aggregate of 6% of a participant's base salary. Matching contributions generally vest after five years of service. 
The DCP allows participants to make pretax contributions of up to 75% of their base salary and 75% of their annual incentive compensation, and to select from one or more investment options in which their deferred compensation is deemed to be invested. As we do not provide a guaranteed rate of return under the DCP, a participant's credited earnings depend on their investment elections. Deferred amounts together with any credited investment returns under the DCP are paid out to participants in a lump sum or in installments, commencing either at a participant-specified date during employment or upon termination of employment, subject to certain limitations. NEO deferrals under the DCP are shown in the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation During Fiscal Year 2018 table. 
We also maintain a supplemental non-qualified, unfunded retirement plan ("Retirement Plan") for certain executives, including Mr. Mezger, whose participation is shown in the Pension Benefits During Fiscal Year 2018 table. The Retirement Plan, closed to new participants since 2004 with no additional benefit accruals to participants (other than cost-of-living adjustments at the same level applied to federal social security benefits), provides each participant with specific annual payments for 20 years that begin upon the later of reaching age 55, the tenth anniversary of a participation commencement date or the termination of employment with us. Mr. Mezger's original annual benefit amount under the Retirement Plan was $450,000.

Number of Years of Credited Service. This is as of the valuation date. As of November 30, 2018, Mr. Mezger is fully vested in his Retirement Plan benefit.
Present Value of Accumulated Benefit. This amount represents the actuarial present value of the total retirement benefit that would be payable to Mr. Mezger under the Retirement Plan as of November 30, 2018. The payment of Retirement Plan benefits is described under "Retirement Programs." The following key actuarial assumptions and methodologies were used to calculate this present value: the base benefit is assumed to begin as of the earliest possible date (generally the later of age 55 or the tenth anniversary of the commencement of participation); the base benefit is adjusted by past and future cost of living adjustments including a 2.8% increase for fiscal year ending November 30, 2019 and an assumed 2.5% increase thereafter, until the last benefits are paid. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit shown in table was 4.11%. Mr. Mezger is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the actuarial value (as specified under the Retirement Plan) of his plan benefits in the event of a change in control or death. If any such event occurred on November 30, 2018, the payment to Mr. Mezger would be $10,938,551, using a 3.22% Applicable Federal Rate discount rate, as specified under the Retirement Plan.
Messrs. Kaminski, Mandino, Praw and Woram are not participants in the Retirement Plan, as the plan was open for a limited period and closed to new participants in 2004.

Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year. These amounts do not include any above-market or preferential earnings. Accordingly, these amounts are not reported in the Summary Compensation Table.
Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year End. These amounts reflect compensation the NEOs earned in 2018 or in prior years, but which they voluntarily elected to defer receipt, adjusted for changes in the value of their investments and distributions, if any. All the NEOs are fully vested in their respective balances. A portion of these amounts was previously reported as deferred compensation in the Summary Compensation Tables in our proxy statements for our 2016 and 2017 annual meetings.
CEO PAY RATIO
As required by applicable law, we are providing the following disclosure about the relationship of Mr. Mezger's annual total compensation in 2018 to that of our median employee. This information is being provided for compliance purposes only and is not used in making compensation decisions.
The annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding Mr. Mezger for the purpose of determining our median employee) was $86,443.
Mr. Mezger's annual total compensation, as reported in  the Total column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, was $11,672,897. 
Based on this information, the ratio of Mr. Mezger's annual total compensation to that of our identified median employee is 135 to 1. 
Identification of our Median Employee. We selected November 30, 2018 as the determination date on which we identified our median employee. As of that date, we had approximately 2,016 full-time and part-time employees. To identify the median employee, we used W-2 compensation for all employees other than Mr. Mezger paid in the 12-month period ended November 30, 2018. We excluded from the calculation two employees on extended leaves of absence who did not work during the period. We then determined the median employee's total compensation as required under SEC rules, which is the same calculation used to determine our NEOs' total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Because the SEC's rules governing the identification of the median compensated employee and the pay ratio calculation based on that compensation allow companies to use a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make estimates and assumptions for their particular circumstances, the pay ratio reported by other companies — including those in our peer group — may not be comparable to the foregoing pay ratio. For instance, other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
Based on the terms of certain of our employee benefit plans — primarily our Executive Severance Plan and our CIC Plan — our NEOs are entitled to certain payments and other benefits if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances and/or if we experience a change in control. Mr. Mezger is also entitled to certain payments and other benefits in such circumstances under the terms of his Employment Agreement. Per Section 409A of the Code, certain payments to our NEOs would not commence for six months following a termination of employment.
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
If we terminate Mr. Mezger without cause or he resigns for good reason (each as defined in his Employment Agreement), or if we terminate any of the other NEOs without cause (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), each is entitled to receive a cash severance payment equal to a multiple of base salary and average bonus. For Mr. Mezger, the severance amount is 2.0 times the sum of his annual salary plus average annual bonus earned for the prior three years, with the total payment capped at $6.0 million. Under certain circumstances, Mr. Mezger would also receive a prorated bonus for the year in which his employment terminates. For Messrs. Kaminski, Mandino, Praw and Woram, the severance amount is 2.0 times the sum of their respective annual base salary in effect at the time of termination and average bonus. The applicable average bonus is the lesser of (a) the average of the annual cash bonuses, if any, paid to them for the three most recent completed fiscal years prior to termination; or (b) 3.0 times their annual base salary. In addition to a severance payment, each NEO is entitled to a continuation of health coverage for up to two years.  In each case, the foregoing benefits are subject to an affected NEO's executing a release and post-termination non-solicitation (for two years), non-disparagement and confidentiality obligations.
For equity awards granted to Mr. Mezger on and after the effective date of his Employment Agreement, he is entitled to (a) two years of additional service credited to compute equity vesting plus full vesting for any equity issued to him in lieu of cash bonuses; (b) the earlier of 36 months and the original term duration of each equity grant to exercise any such outstanding equity; and (c) performance shares paid as if the performance period closed on the termination date if the performance period would otherwise close in the next 24 months. Outstanding equity awards granted to Mr. Mezger before the effective date of the Employment Agreement are governed by their respective terms and conditions with respect to his termination of employment.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
If Mr. Mezger's employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason in connection with a change in control (generally, per his Employment Agreement, during the period starting three months before and ending twelve months after a change in control), he is entitled to (a) a severance payment as described above, except the applicable multiple is 3.0 times rather than 2.0 times and the total payment is capped at $12.0 million; and under certain circumstances, a prorated bonus for the year in which his employment terminates; (b) a continuation of health coverage for up to two years; (c) full vesting of unvested equity granted to him on or after the effective date of his Employment Agreement and prior to 2018, with earlier equity awards governed by their respective terms and conditions; (d) performance shares granted before 2018 paid as earned with the applicable performance period closing as of the date of the change in control; (e) full vesting and lump sum cash payment of deferred compensation, retirement or other employee benefits per the relevant arrangements, provided that lump sum payments subject to Section 409A of the Code are permitted only as provided by the specific terms of those arrangements; and (f) an additional amount to compensate for any excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G").  Mr. Mezger's change in control benefits are subject to the same conditions described under "Termination of Employment".
If a change of control occurs, each of our other NEOs is entitled to receive, subject to executing a release (a) if in the 18-month period following a change in control his employment is terminated other than for cause or disability, or he terminates his employment for good reason (in each case, as defined in the CIC Plan), a severance benefit of 2.0 times the sum of his average base salary and average actual annual cash bonus for the three fiscal years prior to the year in which the change in control occurs; and (b) accelerated vesting of any options and the lapse of any restricted period applicable to any restricted stock or other equity awards awarded to him before 2018. While Mr. Mezger is a participant in the CIC Plan, he is entitled only to CIC Plan benefits that do not duplicate his Employment Agreement benefits in a change in control, and his total severance benefit under the CIC Plan is capped at $12.0 million.

Per the terms of each recipient's award agreement, the vesting of the equity awards granted to our NEOs in 2017 and 2018 will not accelerate upon a change in control unless the recipient is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 18 months of the change in control event. Generally, if such a termination occurs (a) within one year of the award's performance period, the recipient will get a target payout of the award; (b) after the first year of the award's performance period, the recipient will get a payout of the award determined using prorated calculations of the applicable performance measures; and (c) before the award's performance period begins, the recipient will get no payout of the award. 
In addition, under the CIC Plan, only Mr. Mezger and five other senior executives can potentially receive an additional tax restoration amount to compensate for any excise taxes imposed on them under Section 280G and for any taxes on the additional amount. Pursuant to a Board policy, since April 7, 2011, we have not extended this tax restoration benefit to any other officer or employee, including all the other NEOs, even though they are CIC Plan participants.
OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL AND EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION PROVISIONS
The individual award agreements governing outstanding unvested common stock options provide for accelerated vesting upon the recipient's retirement, death or disability, as defined under the agreements. The individual award agreements governing outstanding restricted stock awards provide for accelerated vesting upon the recipient's death or disability, as defined under the agreements. The individual award agreements governing outstanding PSU awards provide for pro-rata vesting if the recipient retires under certain circumstances, and for accelerated vesting upon the recipient's death or disability, as defined under the agreements; provided in each case that payout, if any, is delayed until the performance period is completed. In addition, different provisions govern the length of time a recipient has to exercise a common stock option after termination of employment, depending on the reason for termination. For example, the exercise period may be limited to five days in the case of a termination for cause; while for retirement, death or disability, the exercise period may be the end of the common stock option's original term. 
Our DCP provides for full vesting of benefits if there is a change in control or disability, as those terms are defined under the plan, or death. Our Retirement Plan provides that a participant will immediately receive a lump sum payment of the actuarial value (as specified under the Retirement Plan) of the participant's plan benefits if there is a change in control or death. Our Death Benefit Only Plan provides for (a) distribution of an insurance contract to a participant sufficient to pay the death benefit (if the participant dies anytime before age 100); and (b) an additional tax restoration amount sufficient to pay specified taxes caused by the distribution of the insurance contract and the additional amount, if there is a change in control as defined in the plan. We also maintain term life insurance policies that pay benefits to the designated beneficiaries of certain of our NEOs upon their deaths as described under "Death Benefits." 
The tables below show payments our NEOs may receive assuming various employment termination and change in control scenarios occurred on November 30, 2018; accordingly, equity awards are valued using the closing price of our common stock on that date, which was $21.11. The amounts shown do not include the value of vested and unexercised stock options reported in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2018 table, accrued Retirement Plan and DCP amounts reported in the Pension Benefits During Fiscal Year 2018 table and the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation During Fiscal Year 2018 table (and associated footnotes), respectively, term life insurance benefits, or generally available employee benefits.

[END TABLE]
Mr. Mezger's designated beneficiaries would be entitled to receive an estimated death benefit of $2,012,072 ($1,000,000 benefit plus an income tax restoration payment of $1,012,072) upon his death. The present value of the benefit as of November 30, 2018 is approximately $762,181 based on a 4.45% discount factor and the RP-2014 Top Quartile Employee and Healthy Annuitant Table (M/F), with the MP-2018 generational projection scales for life expectancy (consistent with mortality tables and rates used for Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 715, "Compensation — Retirement Benefits" ("ASC 715") valuations). For the change in control scenarios, the amounts shown are estimated based on the cash surrender value of the underlying life insurance policy as of November 30, 2018 of $569,748, and an estimated income- and payroll-related tax restoration payment of $633,521.
Assumes we make 24 months of contributions for health benefits using current COBRA rates of approximately $3,056 per month.
Assumes payout of 160 hours of vacation benefits as Mr. Mezger is credited with this number of vacation hours during his employment with us, regardless of actual vacation time taken.
Based on Mr. Mezger's five-year historical average compensation, Mr. Mezger is assumed under this scenario to be entitled to a hypothetical excise tax restoration payment under his Employment Agreement. Whether or not Mr. Mezger will be assumed to be entitled to such a payment will depend on his then-five-year average compensation, his future compensation and other factors. Under his Employment Agreement, we will provide Mr. Mezger with such a tax restoration payment to compensate him for any excise taxes under Section 280G on payments due in connection with a change in control. For purposes of calculating the amounts shown, the following major assumptions are used: (i) stock options paid out based on a value of $21.11 less applicable exercise prices, and other equity awards valued with a fair market value of $21.11; (ii) accelerated payment of Retirement Plan and Death Benefit Only Plan benefits, a bonus specified in his Employment Agreement that is payable in lieu of a 2018 fiscal year annual incentive, and his 2015 PSUs, in each case valued using Treas. Reg. Section 1.280G-1 Q&A 24(b); and (iii) prorated portions (two-thirds) of his 2016 PSUs and (one-third) of his 2017 PSUs considered reasonable compensation for services performed prior to the change in control.

ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are seeking an advisory vote from our stockholders on the following resolution to approve our NEOs' 2018 fiscal year compensation: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of KB Home approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to its named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and the related narrative discussion set forth in this Proxy Statement.
We believe that our CEO's and our other NEOs' 2018 fiscal year compensation was well-aligned with our performance and stockholders' interests, as detailed under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," and as shown below. We also believe that the design and implementation of our executive compensation programs reflect our longstanding significant outreach to our stockholders. In turn, our stockholders have generally expressed strong support through our annual NEO compensation advisory votes, including a 91.5% level of approval in 2018 for our approach to linking executive compensation to our strategic and operational goals as well as to stockholder value creation.
We intend to offer this non-binding "Say-on-Pay" vote at each of our annual meetings. Although it is not binding, we and the Board welcome our stockholders' views on our NEOs' compensation and, as in past years, will carefully consider the outcome of this advisory vote consistent with the best interests of all stockholders. As an advisory vote, it is not intended to have any use, application or effect for or on behalf of KB Home or its stockholders outside of this Annual Meeting except as permitted by the Board.
VOTING                                                                                                         STANDARD
This non-binding advisory resolution will be considered approved based upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented, and entitled to vote thereon, at the Annual Meeting.

  BOARD                                              RECOMMENDATION: FOR APPROVAL OF NEO COMPENSATION  
[END TABLE]
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE — 2018 FISCAL YEAR CEO COMPENSATION
90% of our CEO's 2018 compensation was performance-based and his base salary did not increase.
Our CEO's annual incentive award of $6.44 million was performance-driven, determined pursuant to a formula-based plan typical of several of our peers, and reflected our profitability growth and improved asset efficiency in 2018.
100% of our CEO's long-term incentives were PSUs.
Our CEO earned his three-year 2015 PSU award at 167% of target (as discussed under "2015 PSU Awards"), based on our achieving maximum results for AEPS and AROIC (as adjusted for the TCJA-related charge).

RATIFY ERNST & YOUNG LLP'S APPOINTMENT AS INDEPENDENT AUDITOR
In 2018, with management's assistance, the Audit Committee performed an overall review of Ernst & Young LLP as our Independent Auditor, which review is done on at least a quinquennial basis. Among other things, this review assessed whether we should undertake a request-for-proposal process with other firms. Based on the review, the committee determined it would retain Ernst & Young LLP and not undertake such a bid process based on the committee's consideration of the firm's qualifications and performance, quality and candor of communications, independence, integrity, objectivity and professional skepticism. 
In a confirmatory review conducted in January 2019, the Audit Committee, after considering Ernst & Young LLP's proposed fees (on an absolute basis and relative to the fees incurred by our homebuilder peers) and the audit efficiencies that reflect its 28 years of service as our Independent Auditor, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ending November 30, 2019. The Audit Committee believes this appointment is in our and our stockholders' best interests.
We are seeking stockholder ratification of this appointment.
VOTING STANDARD
The Audit Committee's appointment of Ernst & Young LLP will be considered ratified based upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented, and entitled to vote thereon, at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  BOARD                                              RECOMMENDATION: FOR RATIFYING ERNST & YOUNG LLP'S APPOINTMENT  
[END TABLE]
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, make a statement. If Ernst & Young LLP's appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether to retain Ernst & Young LLP, but still may retain the firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines it would be in our and our stockholders' best interests to do so.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FEES AND SERVICES
Services provided by Ernst & Young LLP and related fees in each of our last two fiscal years were as follows:

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee acts under a written charter. Under its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling the Board's oversight responsibilities relating to, among other things, KB Home's corporate accounting and reporting practices, including the quality and integrity of its financial statements and reports, and its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. All Audit Committee members are independent and determined to be "audit committee financial experts" under SEC rules.
In carrying out its role, the Audit Committee, among other activities:
conducts at each regular meeting separate executive sessions with KB Home's chief financial officer; chief accounting officer; chief legal officer; internal audit department head; and Independent Auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, to discuss matters relevant to their respective duties and roles.
annually reviews and approves the internal audit department's audit plan and receives quarterly updates on its performance and results.
oversees management's performance of an annual enterprise risk management assessment and discusses with management identified significant risks in KB Home's business and operations, including cybersecurity risks, along with corresponding mitigating factors.
reviews and discusses with management KB Home's quarterly and annual periodic reports before they are filed with the SEC.
receives and discusses quarterly management reports on the structure and testing of KB Home's system of internal control over financial reporting, and management's assessment of the system's effectiveness.
receives and discusses regular reports from the chief legal officer and senior compliance executives on material legal, compliance and ethics matters, and from Ernst & Young LLP on the results of its audit and internal control evaluation activities.
Management is primarily responsible for KB Home's financial statements, the financial reporting process and assurance for the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP, as Independent Auditor, is responsible for performing an independent audit of KB Home's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of KB Home's audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and the adequacy of KB Home's internal control over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment (with consideration given to ratification by our stockholders), compensation, engagement terms (including fees), retention (or termination, if appropriate) and oversight of the work of the Independent Auditor, which reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also:
evaluates the Independent Auditor's qualifications, independence and effectiveness, and presents its evaluation to the Board, which it did with its quinquennial review discussed under "Ratify Appointment of Independent Auditor." Based on this review, and a confirmatory evaluation in January 2019, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP as KB Home's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2019.
reviews and discusses with the Independent Auditor the scope and plan of its independent audit of KB Home's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting.
receives direct reports from the Independent Auditor describing, among other things, the applicable critical accounting policies and practices in the firm's audit.
approved in 2015 the appointment of the Independent Auditor's current lead audit partner.
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP KB Home's audited financial statements. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's standards.
In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board concerning its independence and has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence from KB Home and KB Home's management.
In reliance on the reviews, reports, activities and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements be included in KB Home's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC.
This report is respectfully submitted by the Audit Committee:
Dr. Thomas W. Gilligan, Chair Dorene C. Dominguez Dr. Stuart A. Gabriel Melissa Lora  James C. Weaver Michael M. Wood

ANNUAL MEETING VOTING MATTERS AND OTHER INFORMATION
Holders of record of the 86,955,192 shares of our common stock that were outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date of February 8, 2019 are entitled to one vote for each share held. The GSOT trustee will vote the 8,157,235 shares of our common stock that the GSOT held on the record date based on the instructions received from eligible employees who hold unexercised common stock options under our employee equity compensation plans, as discussed under "Ownership of KB Home Securities." Accordingly, a total of 95,112,427 shares are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
For stockholders to take action at the Annual Meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date must be present or represented at the meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted for this purpose. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or financial institution does not receive instructions from a beneficial holder and does not have the discretionary authority to vote on an item of business, which will apply for all Annual Meeting matters other than ratifying the appointment of our Independent Auditor. Therefore, if you are a beneficial owner, you must instruct your broker or financial institution on how you want your shares to be voted on the other items of business in order for your shares to be counted for those items.
VOTING YOUR SHARES
Stockholders can vote via the Internet, telephone or mail or in person at the Annual Meeting, as described under "Voting Procedures." There are no dissenters' rights or rights of appraisal as to any item to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. There is no right to cumulative voting.
The named proxies for the Annual Meeting — Jeffrey T. Mezger and Brian J. Woram (or their duly authorized designees) — will follow submitted proxy voting instructions. They will vote as the Board recommends as to any such submitted instructions that do not direct how to vote on any item and will vote on any other matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting in their discretion, including upon any motion to adjourn or postpone all or any portion of the Annual Meeting. We have engaged our transfer agent to count the votes and to act as an independent inspector of election. William A. (Tony) Richelieu, our Corporate Secretary, will also act as an inspector of election.
VOTING STANDARDS
You will find the voting standard for each item of business at the Annual Meeting on the first page on which it is discussed in this Proxy Statement. Approval of any other matter properly presented at the Annual Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented and entitled to vote thereon. Shares that are not present or represented at the Annual Meeting and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome for any items of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the election of directors but will have the effect of an against vote for any other items of business.
PROXY SOLICITATION COSTS 
We will pay the cost to solicit proxies for the Annual Meeting. In addition to this Proxy Statement, our officers, directors and other employees may solicit proxies personally, in writing or by telephone, facsimile, email or other means for no additional compensation. We will, if requested, reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and certain fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses in providing proxy materials to their principals. We have hired Georgeson LLC, a professional soliciting organization, to assist us in soliciting proxies and distributing proxy materials for a fee of $9,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.

ANNEX 1: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES
This Annex provides additional information about KB Home's corporate governance. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE DETERMINATIONS
We believe that a substantial majority of our directors should be independent. To be independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that a director does not have any direct or indirect material commercial or charitable relationship with us based on all relevant facts and circumstances. The Board makes independence determinations from information supplied by directors, director nominees and other sources, the Nominating Committee's prior review and recommendation, and certain categorical standards contained in our Corporate Governance Principles that are consistent with NYSE listing standards. 
The Board determined that all directors who served in 2018 and all director nominees are independent, other than Mr. Mezger. In making its independence determinations, the Board found that Ms. Dominguez's independence was not impaired by, and she did not have a direct or indirect material interest in, one of our division office's leasing a small number of copiers from CIT Group (where she serves as a non-employee director), nor by our making a $10,000 donation to The Dominguez Dream Foundation for which Ms. Dominguez serves as Chair.
The Board also determined that each Compensation Committee member is a "non-employee director" under SEC rules and an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Code.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Nominating Committee reviews any transactions, arrangements or relationships in which we participate and in which a director, director nominee, executive officer or beneficial owner of five percent or more of our common stock (or, in each case, an immediate family member) had or will have a direct or indirect material interest (a "Related Party Transaction"). Covered individuals and stockholders are expected to inform our Corporate Secretary of Related Party Transactions, and we collect information from our directors, director nominees and executive officers so that we can review our records for any such transactions.
The Nominating Committee will approve or ratify a Related Party Transaction if, based on a review of all material facts and feasible alternatives, it deems the transaction to be in our and our stockholders' best interests. In addition, specified categories of transactions set forth in the Nominating Committee's Charter are deemed pre-approved/ratified, including those in which the total amount involved is less than or equal to $120,000; and those that would not (a) need to be reported under federal securities laws, (b) be deemed to impair a director's independence or (c) be deemed to be a conflict of interest.
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND NOMINATIONS
The Nominating Committee evaluates and recommends individuals for election to the Board at regular or special meetings and at any point during the year, taking into consideration, among other factors, the attributes listed in our Corporate Governance Principles and diversity as described under "Board Experience and Skills."  There is no formal policy as to how diversity is applied, and an individual's background and experience, while important, do not necessarily outweigh any other factors.
  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT     49
Back to Contents
Individuals may be nominated by current directors, and the Nominating Committee has retained professional search firms from time to time to assist with director recruitment.  Security holders may propose director nominees by following the procedures set forth in our By-Laws, which require, among other things, timely advance written notice to our Corporate Secretary of any potential nominee that contains specified information about the nominee and the nominating security holder. Director nominees proposed by security holders are considered in the same manner as any other potential nominees.
AUDIT FEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY; AUDIT COMMITTEE DESIGNATION
The Audit Committee has established a policy that requires it to pre-approve all services our Independent Auditor provides to us, including audit, audit-related, tax and other permitted non-audit services. In certain circumstances under the policy, our chief accounting officer (or a functional equivalent) can authorize the firm to perform services, and the Audit Committee Chair can pre-approve services up to a specific per-engagement fee limit. The Chair must report to the Audit Committee any such pre-approvals granted. The Audit Committee approved all services Ernst & Young LLP provided in 2018 and 2017 and the corresponding fees (as shown in the table under "Ratify Ernst & Young LLP's Appointment as Independent Auditor") in accordance with this policy. 
The Audit Committee is a separately designated standing audit committee as defined in Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

ANNEX 2: RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This Proxy Statement contains information regarding Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Pretax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, all of which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant and useful for purposes of this Proxy Statement to understand our 2018 fiscal year performance generally and in relation to the annual incentive payouts the Compensation Committee approved for our NEOs, as described under "2018 Annual Incentives," and how the 2015 PSU performance measures of AEPS and AROIC were determined, as described under "Long-Term Incentives." However, because Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Pretax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these financial measures may not be completely comparable to other companies in the homebuilding industry and, thus, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Pretax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share should be used to supplement the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to provide a greater understanding of our performance and the 2018 fiscal year annual incentive and 2015 PSU payouts to our NEOs. 
The table below reconciles our diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share used in the computation of the 3-Year Diluted EPS growth figure presented in this Proxy Statement (in thousands, except per share amounts):
[BEGIN TABLE]

Income tax expense     (197,600)     112,500     (85,100)        (109,400)        (43,700)        (42,400)

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  $  1.71        $  2.82     $  1.85     $  1.12     $  0.85  
[END TABLE]
Our adjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by excluding a non-cash charge of $112.5 million recorded in 2018 from our reported diluted earnings per share. This charge was primary due to our accounting re-measurement of our deferred tax assets based on the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, under the TCJA.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share.  We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful as it allows for an evaluation of our operating results without the impact of the TCJA-related charge.
The table below reconciles our total pretax income calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Pretax Income used in the computation of the 2018 fiscal year annual incentives (in thousands):

Adjusted Pretax Income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated as our total pretax income excluding incentive and variable compensation expense and inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges related to land purchased or optioned prior to January 1, 2008. For Adjusted Pretax Income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is pretax income.
The tables below reconcile our net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP measures of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share used in the computation of the AEPS and AROIC performance measures for the 2015 PSUs (in thousands, except per share amounts):

[END TABLE]
Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated as our total pretax income excluding inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges related to land purchased or optioned prior to January 1, 2008, and variable compensation expense. Adjusted Net Income also excludes the impact of the TCJA-related charge for the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets. AEPS and AROIC are calculated based on Adjusted Net Income. For Adjusted Net Income and AEPS, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively.
