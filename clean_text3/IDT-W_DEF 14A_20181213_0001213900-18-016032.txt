PROXY STATEMENT
________________________
GENERAL INFORMATION
Introduction
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the stockholders of record of IDT Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "IDT") as of the close of business on October 18, 2018, in connection with the solicitation by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") of proxies for use in voting at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, December 13, 2018 at 10:30 a.m., local time, at the Offices of IDT Corporation, 520 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102. The shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Common Stock") and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Common Stock"), present at the Annual Meeting or represented by the proxies received by Internet or mail (properly marked, dated and executed) and not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement is being mailed to the Company's stockholders starting on November 23, 2018.
Solicitation and Voting Procedures
This solicitation of proxies is being made by the Company. The solicitation is being conducted by mail and by e-mail, and the Company will bear all attendant costs. These costs will include the expense of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Annual Meeting and any reimbursements paid to brokerage firms and others for their expenses incurred in forwarding the solicitation materials regarding the Annual Meeting to the beneficial owners of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The Company may conduct further solicitations personally, by telephone or by facsimile through its officers, directors and employees, none of whom will receive additional compensation for assisting with the solicitation.
The close of business in New York, NY on October 18, 2018 has been fixed as the record date (the "Record Date") for determining the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, the Company had 23,718,224 shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, consisting of 1,574,326 shares of Class A Common Stock and 22,143,898 shares of Class B Common Stock. The remaining shares issued, consisting of 1,698,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and 3,450,600 shares of Class B Common Stock, are beneficially owned by the Company, and are not entitled to vote or to be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. The shares of stock owned by the Company will not be deemed to be outstanding for determining whether a majority of the votes cast have voted in favor of any proposal.
Stockholders are entitled to three votes for each share of Class A Common Stock held by them and one-tenth of one vote for each share of Class B Common Stock held by them. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will vote as a single body on all matters presented to the stockholders. There are no dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection with any proposal.
How do I Vote?
You can vote either in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy without attending the meeting.
Beneficial holders of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the Record Date whose stock is held of record by another party should receive voting instructions from their bank, broker or other holder of record. If a stockholder's shares are held through a nominee and the stockholder wants to vote at the meeting, such stockholder must obtain a proxy from the nominee record holder authorizing such stockholder to vote at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders of record should receive a paper copy of our proxy materials and may vote by following the instructions on the proxy card that is included with the proxy materials. As set forth on the proxy card, there are two convenient methods for holders of record to direct their vote by proxy without attending the Annual Meeting: on the Internet or by mail. To vote by Internet, visit www.voteproxy.com. To vote by mail, mark, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Holders of record may also vote by attending the Annual Meeting and voting by ballot.
All shares for which a proxy has been duly executed and delivered (by Internet or mail) and not properly revoked prior to the meeting will be voted at the Annual Meeting. If a stockholder of record signs and returns a proxy card but does not give voting instructions, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors. If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration and if you have voted your shares by Internet or mail, the persons named as proxies will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you. On the date of filing this Proxy Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC), the Board of Directors did not know of any other matter to be raised at the Annual Meeting.
How Can I Change My Vote?
A stockholder of record can revoke his, her or its proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by delivering to the Company (to the attention of Joyce J. Mason, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary) a written notice of revocation or by executing a later-dated proxy by Internet or mail, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, or other nominee, you must obtain a proxy executed in your favor from the holder of record (that is, your bank, broker, or nominee) to be able to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Quorum and Vote Required
The presence at the Annual Meeting of a majority of the voting power of the Company's outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (voting together), either in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstention votes and any broker non-votes (i.e., votes withheld by brokers on non-routine proposals in the absence of instructions from beneficial owners) will be counted as present or represented at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power present (in person or by proxy) at the Annual Meeting and casting a vote on a Proposal will be required for the approval of the election of any director (Proposal No. 1), the adoption of an amendment to the 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") (Proposal No. 2), the approval of the sale by the Company to Howard S. Jonas of 2,546,689 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock from the Company's treasury account for a purchase price of $15,000,000 (Proposal No. 3), and the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (Proposal No. 4). This means that the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee or Proposal No. 2, 3 or 4 must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director nominee or Proposal No. 2, 3 or 4, respectively. Abstentions are not counted as votes "for" or "against" a nominee or any of these proposals. Proposal No. 5 asks stockholders to express a preference, on an advisory basis, among three possible choices - as to whether future advisory votes on executive compensation should be held every year, every two years, or every three years. Accordingly, abstentions will not be counted as expressing any preference. This advisory vote is non-binding on the Board, but the Board will give careful consideration to the voting results on this proposal and expects to be guided by the alternative that receives the greatest number of votes, even if that alternative does not receive a majority of the votes cast.
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, you must instruct your broker how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the broker can register your shares as being present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), the adoption of an amendment to the 2015 Plan (Proposal No. 2), the approval of the sale by the Company to Howard S. Jonas of 2,546,689 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock from the Company's treasury account for a purchase price of $15,000,000 (Proposal No. 3), the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (Proposal No. 4), the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation (Proposal No. 5) or on any stockholder proposal or other matter raised at the Annual Meeting without instructions from you, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters.
How Many Votes Are Required to Approve Other Matters?
Unless otherwise required by law or the Company's Bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote will be required for other matters that may properly come before the meeting.
Stockholders Sharing the Same Address
We are sending only one copy of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement to stockholders of record who share the same last name and address, unless they have notified the Company that they want to continue to receive multiple copies. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and printings and postage costs. However, if any stockholder residing at such address wishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement in the future, he or she may contact Joyce J. Mason, Esq., Corporate Secretary, IDT Corporation, 520 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102, or by phone at (973) 438-1000, and we will promptly forward to such stockholder a separate Annual Report and/or Proxy Statement. The contact information above may also be used by members of the same household currently receiving multiple copies of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement in order to request that only one set of materials be sent in the future.
References to Fiscal Years
The Company's fiscal year ends on July 31 of each calendar year. Each reference to a fiscal year refers to the fiscal year ending in the calendar year indicated (e.g., Fiscal 2018 refers to the Fiscal Year ended July 31, 2018). CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Introduction
The Company has in place a comprehensive corporate governance framework that reflects the corporate governance requirements and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the corporate governance-related listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Consistent with the Company's commitment to strong corporate governance, the Company does not rely on the exceptions from the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing requirements available to it because it is a "controlled company," except as described below with regard to (i) the composition of the Nominating Committee and (ii) the Company not having a single Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee.
In accordance with Sections 303A.09 and 303A.10 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, the Company has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the full texts of which are available for your review in the Governance section of our website at http://ir.idt.net/Governance and which also are available in print to any stockholder upon written request to the Corporate Secretary.
The Company qualifies as a "controlled company" as defined in Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, because more than 50% of the voting power of the Company is controlled by one individual, Howard S. Jonas, who serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding that being a "controlled company" entitles the Company to exempt itself from the requirement that a majority of its directors be independent directors and that the Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance Committee be comprised entirely of independent directors, the Board of Directors has determined affirmatively that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and the director nominees are independent in accordance with Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and that the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee are in fact comprised entirely of independent directors. As a "controlled company," the Company may, and has chosen to, exempt itself from the New York Stock Exchange requirement that it have a single Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee composed entirely of independent directors. As noted above, and discussed in greater detail below, the Board of Directors maintains a separate Corporate Governance Committee comprised entirely of independent directors, and a Nominating Committee comprised of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and one independent director.
Director Independence
The Corporate Governance Guidelines adopted by the Board of Directors provide that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, and each member of the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees, must meet the independence requirements set forth therein. The full text of the Corporate Governance Guidelines, including the independence requirements, is available for your review in the Governance section of our website at http://ir.idt.net/Governance. For a director to be considered independent, the Board of Directors must determine that a director meets the Independent Director Qualification Standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which comply with the New York Stock Exchange definitions of independent and is free from any material relationship with the Company and its executive officers. The Board of Directors considers all relevant facts and circumstances known to it in making an independence determination, and not merely from the standpoint of the director, but also from that of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation or significant financial interest. In addition to considering all relevant information available to it, the Board of Directors uses the following categorical Independent Director Qualification Standards in determining the "independence" of its directors:
1.     During the past three years, the Company shall not have employed the director, or, except in a non-officer capacity, any of the director's immediate family members;
2.     During the past three years, the director shall not have received, and shall not have an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from the Company, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); 3.     (a) The director shall not be a current partner or employee of a firm that is the Company's internal or external auditor, (b) the director shall not have an immediate family member who is a current partner of such firm, (c) the director shall not have an immediate family member who is a current employee of such firm and personally works on the Company's audit, and (d) neither the director nor any of his or her immediate family members shall have been, within the last three years, a partner or employee of such firm and personally worked on the Company's audit within that time;
4.     Neither the director, nor any of his or her immediate family members, shall be, or shall have been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation (or equivalent) committee; and
5.     The director shall not be a current employee and shall not have an immediate family member who is a current executive officer of a company (excluding tax exempt organizations) that has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three Fiscal Years, exceeds the greater of (a) $1 million or (b) two percent of the consolidated gross revenues of such other company. The Corporate Governance Committee will review the materiality of such relationship to tax exempt organizations to determine if such director qualifies as independent.
In addition, all members of the Company's Audit Committee must meet the independence requirements of Section 2014.10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter.
Based on the review and recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors has determined that each of Michael Chenkin, Eric Cosentino, and Judah Schorr is independent in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Audit Committee Charter and, thus, that a majority of the current Board of Directors, a majority of the director nominees, and each member or nominee intended to become a member of the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees is independent. As used herein, the term "non-employee director" shall mean any director who is not an employee or consultant of the Company, and who is deemed to be independent by the Board of Directors. Therefore, neither Howard S. Jonas nor Bill Pereira is a non-employee director. None of the non-employee directors had any relationships with the Company that the Corporate Governance Committee was required to consider when reviewing independence.
Director Selection Process
The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by the Company's stockholders. Stockholders may recommend director candidates by contacting the Chairman of the Board as provided under the heading "Director Communications." The Nominating Committee considers candidates suggested by its members, other directors, senior management and stockholders in anticipation of upcoming elections and actual or expected board vacancies. All candidates, including those recommended by stockholders, are evaluated on the same basis in light of the entirety of their credentials and the needs of the Board of Directors and the Company. Of particular importance is the candidate's wisdom, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of the business environment in which the Company operates, as well as his or her potential contribution to the diversity of the Board of Directors and his or her willingness to devote adequate time to fulfill duties as a director. Under "Proposal No. 1—Election of Directors" below, we provide an overview of each nominee's experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors to determine that each nominee should serve as a Director.
Director Communications
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with: (i) the Board of Directors, by contacting the Chairman of the Board; (ii) the non-employee directors, by contacting the Lead Independent Director (currently Eric Cosentino); and (iii) the Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance or Nominating Committees of the Board of Directors, by contacting the respective chairmen of such committees. All communications should be in writing, should indicate in the address whether the communication is intended  for the Lead Independent Director, the Chairman of the Board, or a Committee Chairman, and should be directed care of IDT Corporation's Corporate Secretary, Joyce J. Mason, Esq., Stockholder Communications, IDT Corporation, 520 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102.
The Corporate Secretary will relay correspondence (i) intended for the Board of Directors, to the Chairman of the Board, who will, in turn, relay such correspondence to the entire Board of Directors, (ii) intended for the non-employee directors, to the Lead Independent Director, and (iii) intended for the Audit, Compensation, and Corporate Governance Committees, to the Chairmen of such committees.
The Corporate Secretary may filter out and disregard or re-direct (without providing a copy to the directors or advising them of the communication), or may otherwise handle at his or her discretion, any director communication that falls into any of the following categories:
• Obscene materials;
• Unsolicited marketing or advertising material or mass mailings;
• Unsolicited newsletters, newspapers, magazines, books and publications;
• Surveys and questionnaires;
• Resumes and other forms of job inquiries;
• Requests for business contacts or referrals;
• Material that is threatening or illegal; or
• Any communications or materials that are not in writing.
In addition, the Corporate Secretary may handle in her discretion any director communication that can be described as an "ordinary business matter." Such matters include the following:
• Routine questions, service and product complaints and comments that can be appropriately addressed by management; and
• Routine invoices, bills, account statements and related communications that can be appropriately addressed by management.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors held seventeen meetings in Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2018, each of the Company's directors attended or participated in 75% or more of the aggregate of (i) the total number of regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors held during the period in which each such director served as a director and (ii) the total number of regularly scheduled meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors during the period in which each such director served on such committees.
Directors are encouraged to attend the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, and the Company generally schedules a meeting of the Board of Directors on the same date and at the same place as the annual meeting of stockholders to encourage director attendance. All of the members constituting the current Board of Directors attended the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders in person.
Board of Directors Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight Role
Howard S. Jonas has served as Chairman of the Board since the Company's inception. From October 2009 through December 2013, he also served as Chief Executive Officer. On January 1, 2014, Shmuel Jonas, who was the Company's Chief Operating Officer from June 2010 through December 2013, was elected as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Howard S. Jonas remains Chairman of the Board and continues to provide overall leadership to the Board of Directors in its oversight function. The risk management oversight roles of the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees discussed below, which are comprised solely of independent directors, provide an appropriate and effective balance to the Chairman of the Board role.
Section 303A.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that the non-employee directors of the Company meet without management at regularly scheduled executive sessions. These executive sessions are held at every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors. Eric F. Cosentino, an independent director and the "Lead Independent Director," serves as the presiding director of these executive sessions and has served in that capacity since December 17, 2009. The Board of Directors determined that the role of Lead Independent Director is important to maintain a well-functioning Board of Directors that objectively assesses management's proposals.
The Board of Directors and each of its committees conduct annual self-assessments in executive sessions to review and monitor their respective continued effectiveness.
The Board of Directors as a whole, and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management, including the review of the policies with respect to risk management and risk assessment. With the oversight of the full Board of Directors, the Company's senior management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks the Company faces. The Board of Directors is required to satisfy itself that the risk management process implemented by management is adequate and functioning as designed.
Each of the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees oversees certain aspects of risk management and reports its respective findings to the full Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and as is otherwise needed. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing risk management of financial matters, financial reporting, the adequacy of the risk-related internal controls, internal investigations, and security risks, generally. The Compensation Committee oversees risks related to compensation policies and practices. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees our Corporate Governance Guidelines and governance-related risks, such as board independence, as well as senior management succession planning.
Board Committees
The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Corporate Governance Committee and a Nominating Committee. The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, the appointment, compensation, removal and oversight of the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also oversees management's performance of its responsibility for the integrity of the Company's accounting and financial reporting and its systems of internal controls, the performance of the Company's internal audit function and the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee operates under a written Audit Committee charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which can be found in the Governance section of our web site, http://ir.idt.net/Governance, and is also available in print to any stockholder upon request to the Corporate Secretary. The Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Chenkin (Chairman), Cosentino and Schorr. The Audit Committee held seven meetings during Fiscal 2018. The Board of Directors has determined that (i) all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent within the meaning of the Section 303A.07(b) and Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and Rule 10A-3(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (ii) all of the members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and (iii) that Mr. Chenkin qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
The Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing, evaluating and approving all compensation arrangements for the executive officers of the Company, evaluating the performance of executive officers, administering the 2015 Plan, and its predecessor, the 2005 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2005 Plan"), and recommending to the Board of Directors the compensation for Board members, such as retainers, committee and other fees, stock option, restricted stock and other stock awards, and other similar compensation as deemed appropriate. The Compensation Committee confers with the Company's executive officers when making the above determinations. The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Cosentino (Chairman), Chenkin and Schorr. The Compensation Committee held eleven meetings during Fiscal 2018. The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which can be found in the Governance section of our web site, http://ir.idt.net/Governance, and which is also available in print to any stockholder upon request to the Corporate Secretary. The Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent within the meaning of Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and the categorical standards set forth above.
The Compensation Committee adopts goals and objectives for the fiscal year to be used as a guide when determining annual bonus payments to executive officers after the end of the fiscal year. Such goals may be Company-wide or targeted at specific segments, business units or corporate departments. The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of the Company relative to those goals and objectives, and the contribution of each executive officer to such performance at the end of the fiscal year and considers them as some of the factors when determining the amounts of annual bonuses to be awarded to executive officers.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the members of the Compensation Committee have served as an officer or employee of the Company or have any relationship with the Company that is required to be disclosed under the heading "Related Person Transactions." No executive officer of the Company served or serves on the compensation committee or board of any company that employed or employs any member of the Company's Compensation Committee or Board of Directors.
The Corporate Governance Committee
The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and reporting to the Board of Directors on matters involving relationships among the Board of Directors, the stockholders and senior management. The Corporate Governance Committee (i) reviews the Corporate Governance Guidelines and other policies and governing documents of the Company and recommends revisions as appropriate, (ii) reviews any potential conflicts of interest of independent directors, (iii) reviews and monitors related person transactions, (iv) oversees the self-evaluations of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee and (v) reviews and determines director independence, and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding director independence. The Corporate Governance Committee currently consists of Messrs. Cosentino (Chairman), Chenkin and Schorr. The  Corporate Governance Committee held six meetings in Fiscal 2018. The Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which can be found in the Governance section of our web site, http://ir.idt.net/Governance, and which is also available in print to any stockholder upon request to the Corporate Secretary. The Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of the Corporate Governance Committee are independent within the meaning of Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and the categorical standards set forth above.
The Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee is responsible for overseeing nominations to the Board of Directors, including: (i) developing the criteria and qualifications for membership on the Board of Directors, (ii) recommending candidates to fill new or vacant positions on the Board of Directors, and (iii) conducting appropriate inquiries into the backgrounds of potential candidates. A summary of new director qualifications can be found under the heading "Director Selection Process." The Nominating Committee currently consists of Howard S. Jonas (Chairman) and Eric Cosentino. The Board of Directors has determined that Eric Cosentino is independent in accordance with Section 303A.04 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. Howard S. Jonas is not independent. The Company, as a "controlled company," is exempt from the requirement to maintain an independent nominating committee pursuant to Section 303A.00 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which can be found in the Governance section of our web site, http://ir.idt.net/Governance, and which is also available in print to any stockholder upon request to the Corporate Secretary.

Annual compensation for non-employee directors for Fiscal 2018 was comprised of equity compensation, consisting of awards of restricted shares of Class B Common Stock, and cash compensation.
Director Equity Grants
During Fiscal 2018, pursuant to the 2015 Plan, each non-employee director of the Company who was determined to be independent received, on January 5, 2018, an automatic grant of 4,000 restricted shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, which vested in full immediately upon grant. A new non-employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors during the course of the calendar year receives an automatic grant on the date that he or she becomes a director in the amounts specified above, pro rated based on the calendar quarter of the year in which such person became a director. The stock is granted on a going-forward basis, before the director completes his or her service for the calendar year. All such grants of stock to non-employee directors are subject to certain terms and conditions described in the 2015 Plan.
Director Board Retainers
Each non-employee director of the Company receives an annual cash retainer of $50,000. Such retainer is paid in equal quarterly payments provided the non-employee director attended at least 75% of the regularly-scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors that quarter. The annual cash retainer is pro-rated (by calendar quarter based on the calendar quarter when service on the Board of Directors began or ended) for non-employee directors who join the Board of Directors or depart from the Board of Directors during the calendar year, if such director attended 75% of the applicable board meetings for such quarter. The Company's Chief Executive Officer may, in his discretion, waive the requirement of 75% attendance by a director to receive the retainer in the case of mitigating circumstances.
Committee Fees
Non-employee directors do not receive fees for committee service.
Lead Independent Director
The Lead Independent Director receives an additional annual cash retainer of $50,000, paid in equal quarterly amounts upon the completion of each quarter of service. Eric Cosentino has served as the Lead Independent Director since December 17, 2009.

 RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Review of Related Person Transactions
The Board of Directors has adopted a Statement of Policy with respect to Related Person Transactions, which is administered by the Corporate Governance Committee. This policy covers any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a Related Person has a direct or indirect material interest. Related Persons include directors, director nominees, executive officers, any beneficial holder of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities, and any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons. The policy also covers transactions which, despite not meeting all of the criteria set forth above, would otherwise be considered material to investors based on qualitative factors, as determined by the Corporate Governance Committee with input from the Company's management and advisors. Transactions that fall within the definition are considered by the Corporate Governance Committee for approval, ratification or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporate Governance Committee will decide whether or not to approve such transactions and will approve only those transactions that are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If the Company becomes aware of an existing Related Person Transaction that has not been approved under this policy, the matter will be referred to the Corporate Governance Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's 2018 Proxy Statement. Based on our review and discussions, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in IDT's 2018 Proxy Statement.
Eric Cosentino, Chairman
Michael Chenkin
Judah Schorr
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's previous filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that might incorporate future filings, including this Proxy Statement, in whole or in part, the foregoing report shall not be incorporated by reference into any such filings, nor shall it be deemed to be soliciting material or deemed filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Act or under the Exchange Act.
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following discussion and analysis of our compensation practices and related compensation information should be read in conjunction with the Summary Compensation table and other tables included in this proxy statement, as well as our financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, which we refer to as the Form 10-K. The following discussion includes statements of judgment and forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our business, compensation, management's beliefs, and certain assumptions made by us, all of which are subject to change. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "may," "will," "should," "would," "could," "potential," "continue," "ongoing," similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projected performance and compensation. Actual results could differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risk factors discussed in the Form 10-K. We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or such risk factors.
Introduction
It is the responsibility of the Compensation Committee of our board of directors to: (i) oversee our general compensation policies; (ii) determine the base salary and bonus, if any, to be paid each year to each of our executive officers; (iii) oversee our compensation policies and practices as they relate to our risk management; and (iv) determine the compensation to be paid each year to our non-employee directors for service on our board of directors and the various committees of our board of directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee administers our Stock Option and Incentive Plans with respect to restricted stock and stock option grants or other equity-based awards made to our executive officers. Further, certain individuals have received grants of equity in certain of our subsidiaries. Shares of restricted stock are granted to our non-employee directors automatically on an annual basis under our 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and under other policies adopted by the Board and Compensation Committee.
Elements of Compensation
The three broad components of our executive officer compensation are annual base salary, annual cash incentive bonus awards, and long-term equity-based incentive awards. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews total compensation levels and the allocation of compensation among these three components for each of the executive officers, as well as for the Company, in the context of our overall compensation policy. Additionally, the Compensation Committee, in conjunction with our board, reviews the relationship of executive compensation to corporate performance generally and with respect to specific enumerated goals that are approved by the Compensation Committee in each fiscal year. The  Compensation Committee believes that our current compensation plans are serving their intended purposes and are functioning reasonably. Below is a description of the general policies and processes that govern the compensation paid to our executive officers, as reflected in the accompanying compensation tables.
Company Performance
In Fiscal 2018, despite the continuation of difficult market conditions for the Company's legacy core businesses, the Company delivered increases in revenues, income from operations and other financial performance metrics, while continuing to invest in growth initiatives. The positive results were augmented by a change in estimates, but excluding the impact of that change, Fiscal 2018's financial performance exceeded expectations. Wholesale Carrier Services increased its market share and Boss Revolution's calling products proved more resilient to market pressures than anticipated. IDT Telecom's payment services vertical delivered growth in mobile top up revenues and from its direct to consumer money transfer offering. net2phone grew its business organically and through geographic expansion. Investments were made in growth businesses to position the Company to launch enhancements and expansion of offerings in Fiscal 2019. The Company successfully completed the Rafael Spin-Off and has transformed almost exclusively into a telecommunications and payments company.
In Fiscal 2017, IDT Telecom continued to face multiple significant challenges to revenue and profitability, as the telecom industry experienced accelerated movement from paid voice calling over switched phone networks to free over-the-top communications services provisioned over broadband. The Company was able to maintain revenue while seeing its bottom line negatively impacted. IDT Telecom instituted several efforts that were successful in mitigating the impact of the challenges, including cost cutting and development of several new initiatives to diversify revenues and introduce operations with growth and profitability potential. Certain core telecommunications and payment offerings showed resilience to the pressures and new initiatives showed promise and early growth. IDT maintained a healthy balance sheet and paid quarterly dividends. The Company also made progress on monetizing and spinning off non-core assets and operations and developing additional new initiatives.
In Fiscal 2016, IDT Telecom faced significant challenges to revenue and profitability, in particular on the U.S. to Mexico corridor, which was one of the key routes for telecommunications traffic. As previously disclosed, when the cost of terminating calls to Mexico dropped almost to zero, competitors began offering unlimited calling for flat monthly fees. The Company maintained its price constant for a period of time and absorbed the resulting customer attrition. Eventually, the Company lowered its price and offered its own unlimited calling plan, absorbing the consequential impact on profitability. The Company made significant cuts to SG&A expenses to right size and maintain bottom line results despite the top line and margin pressures. As a result, after eliminating the impact of the sale of Fabrix on Fiscal 2015 results, the Company delivered consistent or improved income from operations and net income. Other than on the U.S. to Mexico corridor, revenues from the Company's flagship Boss Revolution voice service were relatively stable, as growth has slowed. Additionally, the Company continued to invest in newer initiatives and saw growth in several offerings, including Boss Revolution's international money transfer business, net2Phone's UCaaS offerings and the National Retail Solutions, Inc. ("NRS") point-of-sale initiative. The Company also invested in efforts that improved its operating efficiencies and allow for development of yet-to-be-launched growth initiatives.
Compensation Structure, Philosophy and Process
Our executive compensation structure is designed to attract and retain qualified and motivated personnel and align their interests with the short-term and long-term goals of the Company and with the best interests of our stockholders. Our compensation philosophy is to provide sufficient compensation to attract the individuals necessary to meet our current needs and planned organic growth and changes in operations, as well as for the business units that represent longer-term growth initiatives and provide them with the proper incentives to motivate those individuals to achieve our long-term plans.
The base salary that we pay to each of our Named Executive Officers is based on the responsibilities undertaken by the respective individuals, if applicable, the business unit managed and its complexity and role within the Company, and the market place for employment of people of similar skills and backgrounds. The base salaries paid are determined by discussions with the covered individual and his or her manager, as well as budgetary considerations. Such base salaries are approved by the relevant members of our senior  management and, in the case of executive officers and certain other key, highly compensated individuals, the Compensation Committee.
Incentive compensation is designed to reward contributions towards achieving the Company's goals for the current period, as well as for the longer term. The Compensation Committee, with recommendations from the Company's management, sets goals for executive compensation in each fiscal year. These goals are set for the Company and for specific operating divisions and are designed to set forth achievable goals for the current performance of the Company and its business units and for current contributions to long-term initiatives. The Compensation Committee's decision regarding bonuses is primarily subjective and specific to each Named Executive Officer and is made by the Committee in its discretion after an overall assessment of all of the factors it deems appropriate, which includes, but is not limited to, the specific Company-wide goals, the individual's role in achieving those goals, if relevant, the performance of the business unit over which the individual exercised management, and other accomplishments during the fiscal year that were deemed relevant in specific instances. Following the end of a fiscal year, our management sets Company-wide bonus amounts for the fiscal year then-ended, based on Company performance and available resources. The proposed bonuses are then presented to the Compensation Committee. The bonus amounts awarded to executive officers are the result of subjective determinations made by the relevant members of management and the Compensation Committee with respect to each subject individual, based on Company and individual performance, particularly relative to the performance goals set by the Compensation Committee for the fiscal year, and levels relative to the bonuses of other personnel and officers. Individual bonus amounts are not determined based on previously established formulae, targets or ranges, though prior year amounts, performance versus budgets and similar figures may serve as guidelines for bonuses for certain executives, and individuals and their direct supervisors may use target figures in initiating discussions of bonus levels.
Executive officers are eligible to receive cash bonuses of up to 100% of base salary (or up to 120% or higher upon extraordinary performance) based upon performance, including the specific financial and other goals set by the Compensation Committee, which goals are Company-wide, specific to a business unit or specific to an executive and his or her area of responsibility, as well as specific extraordinary accomplishments by such officers during the relevant period. Specific bonuses will depend on the individual achievements of executives and their contribution to achievement of the enumerated goals. These goals are approved by the Compensation Committee.
Equity grants are made to provide longer term incentive compensation and to better align the interests of our executives with our stockholders. Executives have been granted equity interests in the Company and, in limited circumstances, with regard to individuals whose areas of responsibility focus on specific operations or who have contributed in significant ways to specific subsidiaries, in those subsidiaries, so as to better incentivize and reward the executives for the results of their efforts.

CEO Pay Ratio
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC requires disclosure of the Company's Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio in this Proxy Statement. The Company identified the median employee by examining the Fiscal 2018 total cash compensation and the approved value of the annual equity awards granted during Fiscal 2018 for all individuals, excluding its Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by it on July 31, 2018, the last day of its fiscal payroll year. The Company included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. The Company did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and it did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by it for all of Fiscal 2018. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
During Fiscal 2018, the Company's Chief Executive Officer was Shmuel Jonas, whose compensation included $850,000 in base salary and bonus and $5,040 in dividends paid on unvested restricted shares of Class B Common Stock.
After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table, above.
As illustrated in the table below, our Fiscal 2018 Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio is 14.3:1.

 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
Marcelo Fischer:    On November 13, 2008, Mr. Fischer and the Company entered into a Confidential Release and Retention Agreement (the "Fischer Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company shall pay Mr. Fischer (or his estate) a severance payment of $550,000 in the event he is terminated without "cause," as defined in the Fischer Agreement, or in the event of Mr. Fischer's death or disability. Mr. Fischer has agreed not to compete with the Company for a period of one year following the termination of his employment.
Howard S. Jonas:    Under the terms of the Fourth Revised Jonas Agreement, in the event of Howard S. Jonas' death or disability, or in the event the Company terminates Howard S. Jonas' employment without "cause" or Howard S. Jonas voluntarily terminates his employment with "good reason," which includes a "change in control," any unvested restricted stock or other equity grant granted in connection with Howard S. Jonas' service to the Company shall vest. In the event of Howard S. Jonas' death or disability, or in the event the Company terminates Howard S. Jonas' employment without "cause" or Howard S. Jonas voluntarily terminates his employment with "good reason," which includes a "change in control," the Company shall pay Howard S. Jonas' estate a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of Howard S. Jonas' annual base salary (at the rate in effect on the date of his death). Howard S. Jonas has agreed not to compete with the Company for a period of one year following the termination of his agreement (other than termination of his employment for "good reason" or by the Company other than for "cause"). In the event that Howard S. Jonas is terminated for "cause," the restrictions shall lapse on the pro-rata portion of the unvested restricted stock for the time served between January of that year and the date of termination.
Bill Pereira:    Under the terms of the Second Pereira Agreement, in the event of Mr. Pereira's death or disability, the Company shall pay Mr. Pereira or his estate a death/disability benefit equal to $800,000, one-half to be paid within ten (10) days of termination, and one-half to be paid monthly in equal installments over the six month period following the date of the initial payment. If Mr. Pereira is terminated without "cause," if he voluntarily terminates his employment with "good reason," each as defined in the Second Pereira Agreement, (i) he is entitled to a payment equal to the greater of $800,000; one-half paid upon ten days after the effective date of a release agreement and one-half paid monthly over the following six month period and (ii) all awards granted under the Company's incentive plan shall vest (and the restrictions thereon lapse). A "change in control" is deemed to be "good reason" under the Second Pereira Agreement. Mr. Pereira has agreed not to compete with the Company for a period of one year following the termination of his agreement.
All Named Executive Officers:    The Named Executive Officers have all been granted stock options and/or restricted stock pursuant to the Company's 2005 Plan and/or the 2015 Plan. Under the 2005 Plan and the 2015 Plan, in the event of "change in control" (other than a "change in control" which is also a "corporate transaction"), each as defined in the 2005 Plan and the 2015 Plan, (i) each option award which is outstanding at the time of the change in control automatically becomes fully vested and exercisable, and (ii) each share of restricted stock is released from any restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights. All severance payments are contingent on Named Executive Officers executing the Company's standard release agreement.
The Named Executive Officers are subject to the Company's Severance Pay and Plan Document (the "Severance Plan"), which was amended and restated on August 3, 2017. Under the Severance Plan, U.S. employees who are terminated without cause are entitled, in specific instances as set forth in the Severance Plan, to severance payments as follows: (i) employees who started on or before August 1, 2009 shall receive four weeks of base pay for each completed year of service and two weeks for each completed period of service that is less than one year of service but greater than six months of service or (ii) employees who started after August 1, 2009 shall receive two weeks of base pay for each completed year of service and one week for each completed period of service that is less than one year of service but greater than six months of service. Such severance payments are capped at 40 weeks of base pay. If a Named Executive Officer is entitled to a greater severance payment pursuant to an agreement, the greater severance payment shall control.
The following table sets forth quantitative information with respect to potential payments to be made to each of the Named Executive Officers upon termination in various circumstances and/or a change in control  of the Company (each an "Event"). The following table assumes the Event took place on July 31, 2018 for each of the Named Executive Officers. The following table uses the closing price of the Company's Class B Common Stock on July 31, 2018, the last trading day in Fiscal 2018 ($5.25). The potential payments are based on agreements entered into by Named Executive Officers with the Company, discussed above, the 2005 Plan and the 2015 Plan. The value of each restricted share is computed by multiplying the closing market price per share of the Company's Class B Common Stock on July 31, 2018, the last trading day in Fiscal 2018 ($5.25), by the number of unvested restricted shares of Class B Common Stock held by the Named Executive Officer on that date.

APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S 2015 STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN
The Company's stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the Company's 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") that will increase the number of shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock available for the grant of awards thereunder by an additional 100,000 shares. The Board of Directors adopted the proposed amendment to the 2015 Plan on November 15, 2018, subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting.
The Board of Directors believes that the proposed amendment to increase the number of shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock available for the grant of awards thereunder by an additional 100,000 shares is necessary in order to provide the Company with a sufficient reserve of shares of Class B Common Stock for future grants needed to attract and retain the services of key employees, directors and consultants of the Company essential to the Company's long-term success.
The proposed amendment is being submitted for a stockholder vote in order to enable the Company to grant, among other equity grants permitted pursuant to the 2015 Plan, options which are incentive stock options ("ISOs") within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and because such approval may be required or advisable in connection with (i) the provisions set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code relating to the deductibility of certain compensation (ii) the provisions set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (iii) the rules and regulations applicable to New York Stock Exchange-listed companies.
The following description of the 2015 Plan, as proposed to be amended by this Proposal, is a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2015 Plan, as proposed to be amended. A copy of the 2015 Plan, as proposed to be amended, is attached hereto as Exhibit A and has been filed with the SEC with this Proxy Statement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE 2015 PLAN
Pursuant to the 2015 Plan, officers, employees, directors and consultants of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and deferred stock units. There are approximately 1,078 employees and directors eligible for grants under the Plan. Options granted under the 2015 Plan may be ISOs or non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs"). Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and limited stock appreciation rights ("LSARs") may be granted either alone or simultaneously with the grant of an option. Restricted stock and deferred stock units may be granted in addition to or in lieu of any other award made under the 2015 Plan.
The maximum number of shares reserved for the grant of awards under the 2015 Plan is 1,130,000 shares of Class B Common Stock (including the 100,000 shares of Class B Common Stock reserved subject to approval of the stockholders). Such share reserves are subject to further adjustment in the event of specified changes to the capital structure of the Company. The shares may be made available either from the Company's authorized but unissued capital stock or from capital stock reacquired by the Company.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 2015 Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2015 Plan, the Compensation Committee determines the type of awards, when and to whom awards will be granted, the number and class of shares covered by each award and the terms, provisions and kind of consideration payable (if any), with respect to awards. The Compensation Committee may interpret the 2015 Plan and may at any time adopt such rules and regulations for the 2015 Plan as it deems advisable, including the delegation of certain of its authority. In determining the persons to whom awards shall be granted and the number of shares covered by each award, the Compensation Committee takes into account the duties of the respective persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Company and such other factors as the Compensation Committee deems relevant.
An option may be granted on such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may approve, and generally may be exercised for a period of up to ten years from the date of grant. Generally, ISOs will  be granted with an exercise price equal to the "Fair Market Value" (as defined in the 2015 Plan) on the date of grant. In the case of ISOs, certain limitations will apply with respect to the aggregate value of option shares which can become exercisable for the first time during any one calendar year, and certain additional limitations will apply to ISOs granted to "Ten Percent Stockholders" of the Company (as defined in the 2015 Plan). The Compensation Committee may provide for the payment of the option price in cash, by delivery of Class B Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such option price, by a combination thereof or by any other method. Options granted under the 2015 Plan will become exercisable at such times and under such conditions as the Compensation Committee shall determine, subject to acceleration of the exercisability of options in the event of, among other things, a "Change in Control," a "Corporate Transaction" or a "Related Entity Disposition" (in each case, as defined in the 2015 Plan).
Each non-employee director will receive 4,000 shares of Class B Common Stock annually. New non-employee directors will receive a pro-rata amount (based on projected quarters of service for such calendar year following the grant date) of such annual grant on their date of initial election and qualification as a non-employee director. The grant date for incumbent annual non-employee director grants will be each January 5th (or the next business day).
The 2015 Plan also provides for the granting of restricted stock awards, which are awards of Class B Common Stock that may not be disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, for such period as the Compensation Committee determines (the "restricted period"). The Compensation Committee may also impose such other conditions and restrictions, if any, on the shares as it deems appropriate, including the satisfaction of performance criteria. All restrictions affecting the awarded shares lapse in the event of a Change in Control, a Corporate Transaction or a Related Entity Disposition.
During the restricted period for a restricted stock award, the grantee will be entitled to receive dividends with respect to, and to vote, the shares of restricted stock awarded to him or her. If, during the restricted period, the grantee's service with the Company terminates, any shares remaining subject to restrictions will be forfeited. The Compensation Committee has the authority to cancel any or all outstanding restrictions prior to the end of the restricted period, including cancellation of restrictions in connection with certain types of termination of service.
The 2015 Plan also permits the Compensation Committee to grant SARs and/or LSARS. Generally, SARs may be exercised at such time or times and only to the extent determined by the Compensation Committee and LSARs may be exercised only (i) during the 90 days immediately following a Change in Control or (ii) immediately prior to the effective date of a Corporate Transaction (as defined in the 2015 Plan). LSARs will be exercisable at such time or times and only to the extent determined by the Compensation Committee. An LSAR granted in connection with an ISO is exercisable only if the Fair Market Value per share of Class B Common Stock on the date of grant exceeds the purchase price specified in the related ISO.
Upon exercise of an SAR, a grantee will receive for each share for which an SAR is exercised, an amount in cash or shares of Class B Common Stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee, equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Fair Market Value of a share of Class B Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised, over (ii) the exercise or other base price of the SAR or, if applicable, the exercise price per share of the option to which the SAR relates.
Upon exercise of an LSAR, a grantee will receive for each share for which an LSAR is exercised, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the greater of (x) the highest Fair Market Value of a share of Class B Common Stock, during the 90-day period ending on the date the LSAR is exercised, and (y) whichever of the following is applicable: (1) the highest per share price paid in any tender or exchange offer which is in effect at any time during the 90 days ending on the date of exercise of the LSAR; (2) the fixed or formula price for the acquisition of shares of Class B Common Stock in a merger in which the Company will not continue as the surviving corporation, or upon a consolidation, or a sale, exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, approved by the Company's stockholders (if such price is determinable on the date of exercise); and (3) the highest price per share of Class B Common Stock shown on Schedule 13D, or any amendment thereto, filed by the holder of the specified percentage of Class B Common Stock, the acquisition of which gives rise to the exercisability of the LSAR over (ii) the exercise or other base price of the LSAR or, if applicable, the exercise price per share of the option to which the LSAR  relates. In no event, however, may the holder of an LSAR granted in connection with an ISO receive an amount in excess of the maximum amount which will enable the option to continue to qualify as an ISO.
When an SAR or LSAR is exercised, the option to which it relates, if any, will cease to be exercisable to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which the SAR or LSAR is exercised, but will be deemed to have been exercised for purposes of determining the number of shares available for the future grant of awards under the 2015 Plan.
The 2015 Plan further provides for the granting of deferred stock units, which are awards providing a right to receive shares of Class B Common Stock on a deferred basis, subject to such restrictions and a restricted period as the Compensation Committee determines. The Compensation Committee may also impose such other conditions and restrictions, if any, on the payment of shares as it deems appropriate, including the satisfaction of performance criteria. All deferred stock awards become fully vested in the event of a Change in Control, a Corporate Transaction or a Related Entity Disposition.
The grantee of a deferred stock unit will not be entitled to receive dividends or vote the underlying shares until the underlying shares are delivered to the grantee. The Compensation Committee has the authority to cancel any or all outstanding restrictions prior to the end of the restricted period, including cancellation of restrictions in connection with certain types of termination of service.
The Board of Directors may at any time and from time to time suspend, amend, modify or terminate the 2015 Plan; provided, however, that, to the extent required by any other law, regulation or stock exchange rule, no such change shall be effective without the requisite approval of the Company's stockholders. In addition, no such change may adversely affect an award previously granted, except with the written consent of the grantee.
No awards may be granted under the 2015 Plan after September 16, 2024, ten years from the Board's approval of the 2015 Plan.
ISOs (and any related SARs) are not assignable or transferable except by the laws of descent and distribution. Non-qualified stock options (and any SARs or LSARs related thereto) may be transferred to the extent permitted by the Compensation Committee. Holders of NQSOs (and any SARs or LSARs related thereto) are permitted to transfer such NQSOs for no consideration to such holder's "family members" (as defined in Form S-8) with the prior approval of the Compensation Committee.
Except as set forth in the table below, the Company cannot now determine the number of options or other awards to be granted in the future under the 2015 Plan to officers, directors, employees and consultants. Actual awards under the 2015 Plan to Named Executive Officers for Fiscal 2018 are reported under the heading "Grant of Plan-Based Awards."

Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards Granted under the 2015 Plan
The Company believes that, under present law, the following are the U.S. federal income tax consequences generally arising with respect to awards under the 2015 Plan:
Incentive Stock Options.    ISOs granted under the 2015 Plan are intended to meet the definitional requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code for "incentive stock options." A participant who receives an ISO does not recognize any taxable income upon the grant of such ISO. Similarly, the exercise of an ISO generally does not give rise to federal taxable income to the participant, provided that (i) the federal "alternative minimum tax," which depends on the participant's particular tax situation, does not apply and (ii) the  participant is employed by the Company from the date of grant of the option until three months prior to the exercise thereof, except where such employment or service terminates by reason of disability or death (where the three month period is extended to one year).
Further, if after exercising an ISO, a participant disposes of the Class B Common Stock so acquired more than two years from the date of grant and more than one year from the date of transfer of the Class B Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of such ISO (the "applicable holding period"), the participant will normally recognize a long-term capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received for the shares and the exercise price. If, however, the participant does not hold the shares so acquired for the applicable holding period — thereby making a "disqualifying disposition" — the participant would realize ordinary income on the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time the ISO was exercised over the exercise price, and the balance of income, if any, would be long-term capital gain (provided the holding period for the shares exceeded one year and the participant held such shares as a capital asset at such time).
A participant who exercises an ISO by delivering Class B Common Stock previously acquired pursuant to the exercise of another ISO is treated as making a "disqualifying disposition" of such Class B Common Stock if such shares are delivered before the expiration of their applicable holding period. Upon the exercise of an ISO with previously acquired shares as to which no disqualifying disposition occurs, the participant would not recognize gain or loss with respect to such previously acquired shares. The Company will not be allowed a federal income tax deduction upon the grant or exercise of an ISO or the disposition, after the applicable holding period, of the Class B Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an ISO. In the event of a disqualifying disposition, the Company generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense to the Company and is reasonable and the limitations of Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code (discussed below) do not apply.
Non-Qualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.    Non-qualified stock options granted under the 2015 Plan are options that do not qualify as ISOs. A participant who receives an NQSO or an SAR (including an LSAR) will not recognize any taxable income upon the grant of such NQSO or SAR. However, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income upon exercise of an NQSO in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares of Class B Common Stock at the time of exercise over (ii) the exercise price. Similarly, upon the receipt of cash or shares pursuant to the exercise of an SAR, the individual generally will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the sum of the cash and the fair market value of the shares received.
The ordinary income recognized with respect to the receipt of shares or cash upon exercise of a NQSO or an SAR will be subject to both wage withholding and other employment taxes. In addition to the customary methods of satisfying the withholding tax liabilities that arise upon the exercise of an SAR for shares or upon the exercise of a NQSO, the Company may satisfy the liability in whole or in part by withholding shares of Class B Common Stock from those that otherwise would be issuable to the participant or by the participant tendering other shares owned by him or her, valued at their fair market value as of the date that the tax withholding obligation arises.
A federal income tax deduction generally will be allowed to the Company in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the individual with respect to his or her NQSO or SAR, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense to the Company and is reasonable and the limitations of Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code do not apply.
If a participant exercises an NQSO by delivering shares of Class B Common Stock to the Company, other than shares previously acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO which is treated as a "disqualifying disposition" as described above, the participant will not recognize gain or loss with respect to the exchange of such shares, even if their then fair market value is different from the participant's tax basis. The participant, however, will be taxed as described above with respect to the exercise of the NQSO as if he or she had paid the exercise price in cash, and the Company likewise generally will be entitled to an equivalent tax deduction. Other Awards.    With respect to other awards under the 2015 Plan that are settled either in cash or in shares of Class B Common Stock that are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in the Code and the regulations thereunder), participants generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of the Class B Common Stock received. Participants also will not recognize income upon the grant of a deferred stock unit, and will instead recognize ordinary income when shares of Class B Common Stock are delivered in satisfaction of such award.
With respect to restricted stock awards under the 2015 Plan that are restricted to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture — absent a written election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code filed with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after the date of transfer of such shares pursuant to the award (a "Section 83(b) election") — a participant will recognize ordinary income at the earlier of the time at which (i) the shares become transferable or (ii) the restrictions that impose a substantial risk of forfeiture of such shares (the "Restrictions") lapse, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (on such date) of such shares over the price paid for the award, if any. If a Section 83(b) election is made, the participant will recognize ordinary income, as of the transfer date, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the Class B Common Stock as of that date over the price paid for such award, if any.
The ordinary income recognized with respect to the receipt of cash, shares of Class B Common Stock or other property under the 2015 Plan will be subject to both wage withholding and other employment taxes. In addition to the customary methods of satisfying withholding tax liabilities that arise with respect to the delivery of cash or property (or vesting thereof), the Company may satisfy the liability in whole or in part by withholding shares of Class B Common Stock from those that would otherwise be issuable to the participant or by the participant tendering other shares owned by him or her, valued at their fair market value as of the date that the tax withholding obligation arises.
The Company generally will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense and is reasonable and the limitations of Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code do not apply.
Change in Control.    In general, if the total amount of payments to a participant that are contingent upon a "change in control" of the Company (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), including awards under the 2015 Plan that vest upon a "change in control," equals or exceeds three times the individual's "base amount" (generally, such participant's average annual compensation for the five calendar years preceding the change in control), then, subject to certain exceptions, the payments may be treated as "parachute payments" under the Code, in which case a portion of such payments would be non-deductible to the Company and the participant would be subject to a 20% excise tax on such portion of the payments.
Certain Limitations on Deductibility of Executive Compensation.    With certain exceptions, Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction to publicly held corporations for compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million per executive per taxable year (including any deduction with respect to the exercise of an NQSO or SAR or the disqualifying disposition of stock purchased pursuant to an ISO). One such exception applies to certain performance-based compensation provided that such compensation has been approved by stockholders in a separate vote and certain other requirements are met. The Company believes that Stock Options, SARs and LSARs granted under the 2015 Plan should qualify for the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m).
On November 15, 2018, the last reported sale price of the Company's Class B Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $8.17 per share. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

(2)       Consists of a grant to Howard S. Jonas of an option to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock granted on May 2, 2017 with an exercise price of $14.93 per share and with certain repurchase rights held by the Company that vested in full immediately upon grant.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR  APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE 2015 PLAN AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. PROPOSAL NO. 3
RATIFICATION OF THE SALE BY THE COMPANY TO HOWARD S. JONAS OF 2,546,689 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S CLASS B COMMON STOCK FROM THE COMPANY'S TREASURY ACCOUNT FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $15,000,000
The Company's stockholders are being asked to approve the actions of the Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Governance Committee") that authorized the Company to sell to Howard S. Jonas, the Company's Chairman of the Board and controlling stockholder, 2,546,689 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock from the Company's treasury account for a purchase price of $15,000,000 (the "Howard Jonas Stock Sale").  The rules of the New York Stock Exchange require stockholder approval of the Howard Jonas Stock Sale.
On April 16, 2018, the Board of Directors of IDT Corporation (the "Company") and its Corporate Governance Committee approved an arrangement with Howard S. Jonas, the Chairman of the Board and controlling stockholder of the Company, related to the purchase of shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company by Mr. Jonas. Under the arrangement, subject to approval of the stockholders of the Company, Mr. Jonas has agreed to purchase 2,546,689 shares of Class B Common Stock at a price per share of $5.89, which was the closing price for the Class B Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on April 16, 2018 (the last closing price before approval of the arrangement) for an aggregate purchase price of $15 million.
The arrangement is subject to approval of the stockholders of the Company, and no shares will be issued unless such approval is obtained. Mr. Jonas has agreed to vote in favor of the arrangement when it is submitted to the stockholders.
Mr. Jonas paid $1.5 million of the purchase price within ten days of the execution of the definitive agreement concerning this transaction. The remainder of the purchase price will be payable within ten (10) days following the approval of the stockholders of the Company, and the shares will be issued upon payment in full. The purchase price per share will be reduced by $229, 202, which is the amount of dividends paid on the 2,546,689 shares of Class B Common Stock whose record date was between April 16, 2018 and the issuance of the shares. Accordingly, the balance of the $15 million purchase price for the Howard Jonas Stock Sale, after deduction of Mr. Jonas' $1.5 million payment and the $229,202 of dividends, is $13,270,798.
Howard S. Jonas is the Company's Chairman of the Board and its controlling stockholder.   See SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT, above, for details regarding Mr. Jonas' holdings of securities of the Company.
Section 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires the Company's stockholders to approve the Howard Jonas Stock Sales.
The closing price of the Company's Class B Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15 was $8.17.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE HOWARD JONAS STOCK SALE, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. PROPOSAL NO. 4
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company asking its stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of the "Named Executive Officers" identified in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table in the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement. This vote is advisory and not binding on the Company; however, it will provide feedback concerning its executive compensation program.
As noted in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company's executive compensation program implements and achieves the goals of its executive compensation philosophy. That philosophy, which is set by the Compensation Committee, is designed to attract and retain qualified and motivated personnel and align their interests with the short-term and long-term goals of the Company and with the best interests of its stockholders. The Company's compensation philosophy is to provide compensation to attract the individuals necessary for its current needs and growth initiatives and provide them with the proper incentives to motivate those individuals to achieve its long-term plans. 
The three broad components of the Company's executive officer compensation are base salary, annual cash incentive bonuses awards, and long term equity-based incentive awards. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews total compensation levels and the allocation of compensation among these three components for each of the executive officers in the context of the Company's overall compensation policy. Additionally, the Compensation Committee, in conjunction with our Board of Directors, reviews the relationship of executive compensation to corporate performance generally and with respect to specific enumerated goals that are established by the Compensation Committee early in each fiscal year. The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's current compensation plans are competitive and reasonable.
Further details concerning how we implement the Company's philosophy and goals, and how it applies the above principles to its compensation program, are provided in the Compensation, Discussion and Analysis above. In particular, it is discussed how the Company's set compensations targets and other objectives and evaluate performance against those targets and objectives to assure that performance is appropriately rewarded.
The compensation of the Named Executive Officers was set by the Company's Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company after discussions with management about the recommended levels and components of compensation for each of the individuals.
Stockholders are urged to read the Compensation, Discussion and Analysis and other information in the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the information provided in that section demonstrates that the Company's executive compensation program aligns our executives' compensation with the Company's short-term and long-term performance and provides the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives who are crucial to the Company's long-term success. Accordingly, the following resolution will be submitted for a stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of IDT Corporation (the "Company") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative disclosures."
Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors will review the results of the vote. The Compensation Committee will consider stockholders' concerns and take them into account in future determinations concerning the Company's executive compensation program.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL,  ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S  NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS STATED IN THE ABOVE RESOLUTION. PROPOSAL NO. 5
ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES  ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In addition to seeking a stockholders' advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, the Company is asking its stockholders to express a preference as to how frequently future advisory votes on executive compensation should take place. As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is giving stockholders the opportunity to express a preference to cast such advisory votes annually, every two years or every three years; stockholders also have the option to abstain from voting on this matter. For the reasons discussed below, the Board of Directors recommends that advisory votes on executive compensation take place every three years.
The Board believes that a vote every three years provides adequate assurance that the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee remain accountable for executive compensation decisions on a frequent basis.
Accordingly, the Company's Board believes that an advisory vote every three years is preferable, as it would foster a long-term approach to evaluating the Company's executive compensation program while maintaining accountability for executive compensation decisions. If a plurality of the votes cast on this matter at the Annual Meeting is cast in favor of advisory votes on executive compensation every three years, the Company would adopt this approach. On this basis, the next advisory vote on executive compensation, would take place at the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting.
Although the frequency vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the results of the vote. The Board and the Compensation Committee will consider stockholders' views and take them into account in determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS SELECT  "THREE YEARS" ON THE PROPOSAL CONCERNING THE FREQUENCY OF  FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL 2019
BDO USA, LLP is the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and has served the Company as its independent registered public accounting firm since February 1, 2017. BDO USA, LLP was the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2018. Prior to February 1, 2017, Grant Thornton LLP served the Company as its independent registered public accounting firm since 2008.
The Company is not asking stockholders to ratify at the Annual Meeting the appointment of BDO USA, LLP or any other firm as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the Fiscal Year ending July 31, 2019.
We expect that representatives for BDO USA, LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make such statements as they may desire.
The following table presents fees billed for professional services rendered by BDO USA, LLP for the period from February 1, 2017 to July 31, 2018.

The Audit Committee concluded that the provision of the non-audit services listed above is compatible with maintaining the independence of BDO USA, LLP.
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, and all such services were approved by the Audit Committee in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017.
The Audit Committee assesses requests for services by the independent registered public accounting firm using several factors. The Audit Committee will consider whether such services are consistent with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's ("PCAOB") and SEC's rules on auditor independence. In addition, the Audit Committee will determine whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service based upon the members' familiarity with the Company's business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and whether the service might enhance the Company's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality.
Report of the Audit Committee
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its general oversight of the Company's financial reporting process, internal controls, and audit functions. The Audit Committee's purpose is more fully described in its charter, which can be found on the Company's website at http://ir.idt.net/Committees. The Audit Committee reviews its charter on an annual basis. The Board of Directors reviews annually the NYSE listing standards' definition of independence for Audit Committee  members and has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets that standard. The Board of Directors has also determined that Michael Chenkin qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
The Company's management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Company's financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal controls, and procedures designed to reasonably assure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. The Company has a full-time Internal Audit department that reports to the Audit Committee and to the Company's management. This department is responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of the Company's system of internal controls related to, for example, the reliability and integrity of the Company's financial information and the safeguarding of the Company's assets.
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2018, BDO USA, LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with law, the Audit Committee has ultimate authority and responsibility for selecting, compensating, evaluating, and, when appropriate, replacing the Company's independent audit firm, and evaluates its independence. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage its own outside advisors, including experts in particular areas of accounting, as it determines appropriate, apart from counsel or advisors hired by the Company's management.
Audit Committee members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of the Company's management and the independent audit firm; nor can the Audit Committee certify that the independent audit firm is "independent" under applicable rules. The Audit Committee serves a Board-level oversight role in which it provides advice, counsel, and direction to the Company's management and to the auditors on the basis of the information it receives, discussions with the Company's management and the auditors, and the experience of the Audit Committee's members in business, financial, and accounting matters.
The Audit Committee's agenda for the year includes reviewing the Company's financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, and audit and other matters. The Audit Committee meets each quarter with BDO USA, LLP and the Company's management to review the Company's interim financial results before the publication of the Company's quarterly earnings releases. The Company's management's and the independent audit firm's presentations to, and discussions with, the Audit Committee cover various topics and events that may have significant financial impact or are the subject of discussions between the Company's management and the independent audit firm. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with the Company's management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps that the Company's management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. In accordance with law, the Audit Committee is responsible for establishing procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, including confidential, anonymous submission by the Company's employees, received through established procedures, of any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
Among other matters, the Audit Committee monitors the activities and performance of the Company's internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, including the audit scope, external audit fees, auditor independence matters, and the extent to which the independent audit firm can be retained to perform non-audit services. The Company's independent audit firm has provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent audit firm and the Company's management that firm's independence. In accordance with Audit Committee policy and the requirements of law, the Audit Committee pre-approves all services to be provided by BDO USA, LLP. Pre-approval includes audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services.
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Company's management the audited financial statements of the Company for the Fiscal Year ended July 31, 2018, as well as the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting as of July 31, 2018. The Committee has also reviewed  and discussed with BDO USA, LLP the matters required to be discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm by applicable PCAOB rules regarding "Communication with Audit Committees."
In reliance on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Exhibit A
IDT CORPORATION  2015 STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN  Effective January 1, 2015 to September 16, 2024 (Amended and Restated on November 15, 2018)

Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, for such period as the Committee shall determine from the date on which the award is granted (the "Restricted Period"). The Committee may also impose such additional or alternative restrictions and conditions on the shares as it deems appropriate including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of performance criteria. Such performance criteria may include, without limitation, sales, earnings before interest and taxes, return on investment, earnings per share, any combination of the foregoing or rate of growth of any of the foregoing, as determined by the Committee. The Company may, at its option, maintain issued shares in book entry form. Certificates, if any, for shares of stock issued pursuant to Restricted Stock awards shall bear an appropriate legend referring to such restrictions, and any attempt to dispose of any such shares of stock in contravention of such restrictions shall be null and void and without effect. During the Restricted Period, any such certificates shall be held in a restricted account a at the transfer agent appointed by the Company. In determining the Restricted Period of an award, the Committee may provide that the foregoing restrictions shall lapse with respect to specified percentages of the awarded shares on successive anniversaries or other specified dates of the date of such award.
(c)     FORFEITURE.  Subject to such exceptions as may be determined by the Committee, if the Grantee's Continuous Service with the Company or any Subsidiary shall terminate for any reason prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period of an award, any shares remaining subject to restrictions (after taking into account the provisions of Subsection (e) of this Section 11) shall thereupon be forfeited by the Grantee and transferred to, and retired by, the Company without cost to the Company or such Subsidiary, and such shares shall become available for subsequent grants of awards under the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.
(d)     OWNERSHIP.  During the Restricted Period, the Grantee shall possess all incidents of ownership of such shares, subject to Subsection (b) of this Section 11, including the right to receive dividends with respect to such shares and to vote such shares.
(e)     ACCELERATED LAPSE OF RESTRICTIONS.  Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 13 of the Plan (and subject to the conditions set forth therein), all restrictions then outstanding on any shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan shall lapse as of the applicable date set forth in Section 13. The Committee shall have the authority (and the Agreement may so provide) to cancel all or any portion of any outstanding restrictions prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any or all of the shares of Restricted Stock awarded on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
11A.  Deferred Stock Units. 
The Committee may award Deferred Stock Units to any outside director, eligible employee or consultant of the Company or of any Subsidiary. Each award of Deferred Stock Units under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written Agreement between the Company and the Grantee, in such form as the Committee shall from time to time approve, which Agreement shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions, unless otherwise specifically provided in such Agreement:
(a)     NUMBER OF SHARES.  Each Agreement for Deferred Stock Units shall state the number of shares of Class B Common Stock to be subject to an award.
(b)     RESTRICTIONS.  Deferred Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, until shares of Class B Common Stock are payable with respect to an award. The Committee may impose such vesting restrictions and conditions on the payment of shares as it deems appropriate including the satisfaction of performance criteria. Such performance criteria may include sales, earnings before interest and taxes, return on investment, earnings per share, any combination of the foregoing or rate of growth of any of the foregoing, as determined by the Committee.
(c)     FORFEITURE.  Subject to such exceptions as may be determined by the Committee, if the Grantee's Continuous Service with the Company or any Subsidiary shall terminate for any reason 
A-10
prior to the Grantee becoming fully vested in the award, then the Grantee's rights under any unvested Deferred Stock Units shall be forfeited without cost to the Company or such Subsidiary.
(d)     OWNERSHIP.  Until shares are delivered with respect to Deferred Stock Units, the Grantee shall not possess any incidents of ownership of such shares, including the right to receive dividends with respect to such shares and to vote such shares.
(e)     ACCELERATED LAPSE OF RESTRICTIONS.  Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 13 of the Plan (and subject to the conditions set forth therein), all restrictions then outstanding on any Deferred Stock Units awarded under the Plan shall lapse as of the applicable date set forth in Section 13. The Committee shall have the authority (and the Agreement may so provide) to cancel all or any portion of any outstanding restrictions prior to the expiration of any restricted period with respect to any or all of the shares of Deferred Stock Units awarded on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
12.    Effect of Certain Changes.
(a)     ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  In the event of any extraordinary liquidating dividend, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, stock split, warrant or rights issuance, or combination or exchange of such shares, or other similar transactions, the Committee shall equitably adjust (i) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock available for awards under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or kind of shares covered by outstanding awards and (iii) the Option Price per share of Options or the applicable market value of Stock Appreciation Rights or Limited Rights, in each such case so as to reflect such event and preserve the value of such awards; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated. This provision shall not apply to cash dividends or returns of capital.
(b)     CHANGE IN CLASS B COMMON STOCK.  In the event of a change in the Class B Common Stock as presently constituted that is limited to a change of all of its authorized shares of Class B Common Stock into the same number of shares with a different par value or without par value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be the Class B Common Stock within the meaning of the Plan.
13.    Corporate Transaction; Change in Control; Related Entity Disposition.
(a)     CORPORATE TRANSACTION.  In the event of a Corporate Transaction, each award which is at the time outstanding under the Plan shall automatically become fully vested and exercisable and, in the case of an award of Restricted Stock or an award of Deferred Stock Units, shall be released from any restrictions on transfer (except with regard to the Insider Trading Policy and such other agreements between the Grantee and the Company) and repurchase or forfeiture rights, immediately prior to the specified effective date of such Corporate Transaction. Effective upon the consummation of the Corporate Transaction, all outstanding awards of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Limited Rights under the Plan shall terminate, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. However, all such awards shall not terminate if the awards are, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, assumed by the successor corporation or Parent thereof.
(b)     CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control which is also a Corporate Transaction), each award which is at the time outstanding under the Plan automatically shall become fully vested and exercisable and, in the case of an award of Restricted Stock or an award of Deferred Stock Units, shall be released from any restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights, immediately prior to the specified effective date of such Change in Control.
(c)     RELATED ENTITY DISPOSITION.  The Continuous Service of each Grantee (who is primarily engaged in service to a Related Entity at the time it is involved in a Related Entity Disposition) shall terminate effective upon the consummation of such Related Entity Disposition, and each outstanding award of such Grantee under the Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable and, in the case of an award of Restricted Stock or an award of Deferred Stock Units, shall be released from any restrictions on transfer (except with regard to the Insider Trading Policy and such other 
A-11
agreements between the Grantee and the Company). Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Continuous Service of a Grantee shall not be deemed to terminate (and each outstanding award of such Grantee under the Plan shall not become fully vested and exercisable and, in the case of an award of Restricted Stock or an award of Deferred Stock Units, shall not be released from any restrictions on transfer) if (i) a Related Entity Disposition involves the spin-off of a Related Entity, for so long as such Grantee continues to remain in the service of such entity that constituted the Related Entity immediately prior to the consummation of such Related Entity Disposition ("SpinCo") in any capacity of officer, employee, director or consultant or (ii) an outstanding award is assumed by the surviving corporation (whether SpinCo or otherwise) or its parent entity in connection with a Related Entity Disposition.
(d)     SUBSTITUTE AWARDS.  The Committee may grant awards under the Plan in substitution of stock-based incentive awards held by employees, consultants or directors of another entity who become employees, consultants or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of a merger or consolidation of such entity with the Company or any Subsidiary, or the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of property or equity of such entity, upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, and such awards shall not count against the share limitation set forth in Section 5 of the Plan.
14.    Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock.
The provisions of this Section 14 shall apply only to certain grants of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors, as provided below. Except as set forth in this Section 14, the other provisions of the Plan shall apply to grants of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors to the extent not inconsistent with this Section. For purposes of interpreting Section 6 of the Plan and this Section 14, a Non-Employee Director's service as a member of the Board or the board of directors of any Subsidiary shall be deemed to be employment with the Company.
(a)     GENERAL. Non-Employee Directors shall receive Restricted Stock in accordance with this Section 14. Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Section 14 shall be subject to the terms of such section and shall not be subject to discretionary acceleration of vesting by the Committee. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, Non-Employee Directors shall not receive separate and additional grants hereunder for being a Non-Employee Director of (i) the Company and a Subsidiary or (ii) more than one Subsidiary.
(b)     INITIAL GRANTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK. A Non-Employee Director who first becomes a Non-Employee Director shall receive a pro-rata amount (based on projected quarters of service to the following Non-Employee Director Grant Date) of a Non-Employee Director Annual Grant on his date of appointment as a Non-Employee Director. 
(c)     ANNUAL GRANTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK. On each Non-Employee Director Grant Date, each Non-Employee Director shall receive a Non-Employee Director Annual Grant. 
(d)     VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK. Restricted Stock granted under this Section 14 shall be fully vested on the date of grant.
15.    Period During which Awards May Be Granted.
Awards may be granted pursuant to the Plan from time to time commencing on January 1, 2015 until September 16, 2024 (ten (10) years from September 17, 2014, the date the Board initially adopted the Plan). No awards shall be effective prior to the approval of the Plan by a majority of the Company's stockholders.
16.    Transferability of Awards.
(a)     Incentive Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other than by the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Grantee, only by the Grantee or his or her guardian or legal representative.
A-12
(b)     Nonqualified Stock Options shall be transferable in the manner and to the extent acceptable to the Committee, as evidenced by a writing signed by the Company and the Grantee. Nonqualified Stock Options (together with any Stock Appreciation Rights or Limited Rights related thereto) shall be transferable by a Grantee as a gift to the Grantee's "family members" (as defined in Form S-8) under such terms and conditions as may be established by the Committee; provided that the Grantee receives no consideration for the transfer. Notwithstanding the transfer by a Grantee of a Nonqualified Stock Option, the transferred Nonqualified Stock Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Nonqualified Stock Option immediately before the transfer (including, without limitation, the Insider Trading Policy) and the Grantee will continue to remain subject to the withholding tax requirements set forth in Section 17 hereof.
(c)     The terms of any award granted under the Plan, including the transferability of any such award, shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs and successors of the Grantee.
(d)     Restricted Stock shall remain subject to the Insider Trading Policy after the expiration of the Restricted Period. Deferred Stock Units shall remain subject to the Insider Trading Policy after payment thereof.
17.    Agreement by Grantee regarding Withholding Taxes.
If the Committee shall so require, as a condition of exercise of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Limited Right, the expiration of a Restricted Period or payment of a Deferred Stock Unit (each, a "Tax Event"), each Grantee shall agree that no later than the date of the Tax Event, the Grantee will pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding payment of any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld upon the Tax Event. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, a Grantee shall permit, to the extent permitted or required by law, the Company to withhold federal, state and local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld upon the Tax Event from any payment of any kind due to the Grantee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any such above-described withholding obligation may, in the discretion of the Company, be satisfied by the withholding by the Company or delivery to the Company of Class B Common Stock.
18.    Rights as a Stockholder.
Except as provided in Section 11(d) of the Plan, a Grantee or a transferee of an award shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the award until the date of the issuance of such shares to him or her. No adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property) or distribution of other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 12(a) of the Plan.
19.    No Rights to Employment; Forfeiture of Gains.
Nothing in the Plan or in any award granted or Agreement entered into pursuant hereto shall confer upon any Grantee the right to continue as a director of, in the employ of, or in a consultant relationship with, the Company or any Subsidiary or to be entitled to any remuneration or benefits not set forth in the Plan or such Agreement or to interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any such Subsidiary to terminate such Grantee's employment or consulting relationship. Awards granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change in duties or position of a Grantee as long as such Grantee continues to be employed by, or in a consultant relationship with, or a director of the Company or any Subsidiary. The Agreement for any award under the Plan may require the Grantee to pay to the Company any financial gain realized from the prior exercise, vesting or payment of the award in the event that the Grantee engages in conduct that violates any non-compete, non-solicitation or non-disclosure obligation of the Grantee under any agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any such obligations provided in the Agreement.
20.    Beneficiary.
A Grantee may file with the Committee a written designation of a beneficiary on such form as may be prescribed by the Committee and may, from time to time, amend or revoke such designation. If no 
A-13
designated beneficiary survives the Grantee, the executor or administrator of the Grantee's estate shall be deemed to be the Grantee's beneficiary.
21.    Authorized Share Approval; Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
(a)     AUTHORIZED SHARE APPROVAL.  The Plan was adopted by the Board on September 17, 2014. The Plan was ratified by the Company's stockholders on December 15, 2014, with 500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock authorized for awards under the Plan. The Plan shall become effective on January 1, 2015 and shall terminate on September 16, 2024. The Board amended the Plan on September 24, 2015 and October 13, 2016 to increase the amount of authorized shares under the Plan to 600,000 and then 700,000, respectively, shares of Class B Common Stock. The Company's stockholders ratified such amendments to the Plan on December 14, 2015 and December 14, 2016, respectively.  The Board amended the Plan on September 28, 2017 to increase the amount of authorized shares under the Plan to 1,030,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. The Company's stockholders ratified such amendment to the Plan on December 14, 2017. The Board amended the Plan on November 15 2018 to increase the amount of authorized shares under the Plan to 1,130,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. The Company's stockholders ratified such amendment to the Plan on December 13, 2018.
(b)     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.  The Board, or the Committee if so delegated by the Board, at any time and from time to time may suspend, terminate, modify or amend the Plan; however, unless otherwise determined by the Board, or the Committee if applicable, an amendment that requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with any law, regulation or stock exchange requirement shall not be effective unless approved by the requisite vote of stockholders. Except as provided in Section 13(a) of the Plan, no suspension, termination, modification or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any award previously granted, unless the written consent of the Grantee is obtained. 
22.    Governing Law.
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
