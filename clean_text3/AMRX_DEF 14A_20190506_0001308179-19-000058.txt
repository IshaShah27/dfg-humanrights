To
Our Valued  Stockholders,
Robert Stewart
President & Chief Executive Officer
2018 was a year of significant progress for Amneal. We evolved our company with the completion of the Impax Laboratories merger – a transformative combination that has established Amneal as an industry leader with high-value generic product pipelines and a growing specialty business. Our team did an incredible job completing the Impax integration, accelerating synergy capture, launching high-value products and driving future value through the effective deployment of our capital.
As a result, even as we face significant market headwinds, we are entering 2019 a stronger, more robust Amneal with a clearly defined strategy to maximize our growth potential, stay ahead of the competition and respond to the current environment. By executing on this strategy, we are confident that we will deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders and advance our mission to "make healthy possible."
2018 Highlights
Although 2018 combined revenues were essentially flat due to industry headwinds and earlier-than-expected competition on key products, we achieved strong 2018 bottom-line results. Notably, on a full-year basis, combined adjusted EBITDA* grew by 16% to $584 million, combined adjusted diluted EPS* was $0.98 and operating cash flow was $250 million. In addition, we achieved sequential growth across all metrics as we moved through the year and ended 2018 with a strong fourth quarter.
"Our near-term priorities are focused on delivering double-digit earnings growth and solid operational cash flows"
We made significant strides in achieving our strategic priorities in 2018. We completed the Impax merger in May, and at the same time acquired Gemini Laboratories. The integration of Amneal with Impax and Gemini is largely complete. By the end of 2018, we completed nearly all key integration milestones and rapidly captured $60 million in synergies for 2018. We are ahead of schedule to deliver more than $200 million in synergies by the end of 2020.
Through our focus on operational excellence, we advanced our strategy to build a diversified pipeline of complex, high-value generic products to help insulate our company from market competition and pricing pressures. In 2018, Amneal led the U.S. generics industry in both approvals and launches, including 62 ANDA approvals, 10 tentative approvals and 42 new products launched. 33% of our new product launches were from injectable, topical or liquid products, further diversifying our portfolio of more than 200 generic products.
Our Specialty segment delivered strong script and revenue growth from key marketed products Rytary® and Unithroid®. Our R&D team was very active as well, submitting 31 ANDAs – 65% for non-oral solid dosage forms – and advancing our Specialty candidate IPX203 with the dosing of first patients in our Phase 3 study.
Through the strategic deployment of our capital, we acquired Gemini Laboratories and capitalized on creative partnership opportunities that further diversify our portfolio. This included driving additional value in generics with Jerome Stevens, Lannett and American Regent, and in biosimilars with mAbxience.
Looking Ahead: Building on a United Culture to Learn, Lead and Succeed
We have made excellent progress developing a strong and united employee culture at Amneal. We introduced our dynamic Learn, Lead, Succeed program, which is uniting our global team around common beliefs and powerful actions to propel Amneal forward. Looking ahead, we will introduce programs in 2019 to further align rewards and recognition, as well as learning and development, with our Learn, Lead, Succeed objectives.
With the Impax integration complete, we are shifting our focus to optimizing and strengthening our infrastructure and systems, and generating additional cost-savings that will help Amneal be more competitive and profitable in today's market environment.
Our near-term priorities are focused on delivering double-digit earnings growth and solid operational cash flows. To do this, we will accelerate organic growth through the advancement of more than 215 products filed with the FDA or in development, drive continued operational excellence, improve our earnings potential by capturing targeted synergies, and leverage those savings to reinvest in the business.
From a long-term perspective, we are focused on strategically deploying our capital to support our growth goals. This will include expanding our generics business, where our focus is on high-value opportunities, and growing our specialty and biosimilars portfolios. At the same time, we will consider other adjacencies to insulate the company from the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are common to the generics industry. We will also continue pursuing creative business development opportunities to accelerate our growth.
Making Healthy Possible
This is a very exciting time for Amneal. We continue evolving the capabilities, strategy and talent to advance our company and provide patients with solutions that 'make healthy possible'.
I want to thank our more than 6,000 employees world-wide who over the past year have relentlessly executed against our strategy while navigating through market headwinds. Thanks to their efforts we have made Amneal stronger for patients, customers and shareholders. We're very optimistic about Amneal's long-term growth potential and look forward to keeping you updated.
Sincerely,
Robert A. Stewart
President and Chief Executive Officer

Corporate Governance
Business Combination and Corporate Structure
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") is a Delaware corporation that was formed on October 4, 2017, for the purpose of facilitating the combination (the "Combination") of Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC ("Amneal"), a Delaware limited liability company, and Impax Laboratories, Inc. ("Impax"), a Delaware corporation. Prior to the Combination, Amneal was a privately held limited liability company and Impax was a publicly held corporation. As a result of the Combination, Impax became a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Amneal, and Amneal became the operating company for the combined business. The group, together with their affiliates and certain assignees, who owned Amneal prior to the Combination (the "Amneal Group") continues to hold approximately 57% of the equity interests in Amneal, and the Company holds the remaining 43% of the equity interests in Amneal. The Amneal Group also holds approximately 57% of the common stock of the Company through its collective ownership of all of the issued and outstanding shares of class B common stock. Although the Company holds a minority economic interest in Amneal, as the managing member of Amneal we conduct and exercise full control over all activities of Amneal. Three members of the Amneal Group, Chirag Patel, Chintu Patel and Gautam Patel, are members of our Board of Directors and have been nominated for election at the annual meeting of stockholders.
Stockholders Agreement
In connection with the Combination, we entered into a stockholders agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement") with the Amneal Group that sets forth, among other things, certain rights and obligations of the Company and the Amneal Group with respect to the corporate governance of the Company.
Board Composition
The Stockholders Agreement provides that the Board of Directors of the Company will consist of no more than 13 members, subject to increase if TPG Group Holdings' ("TPG") exercises its right to designate a director for appointment to the Company's Board (as described below).
Following the closing of the Combination, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board was composed as follows:
For so long as the Amneal Group continues to beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company, directors designated by the Amneal Group will have the right to designate the Co-Chairmen of the Board, and the Non-Amneal Group directors will have the right to designate the Lead Independent Director of the Board.
TPG, which holds all of our issued and outstanding class B-1 common stock by virtue of its investment in the Company, has the right, subject to certain ownership thresholds and other limitations, to designate a director for appointment to the Company's Board (which right TPG has not exercised) or to designate an observer to the Board.
If TPG exercises its right to designate a director, its designee will be appointed to the Board subject to the approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board. Upon such appointment, subject to certain limitations, the Amneal Group will have the right to designate an additional director to the Board. The addition of such TPG and Amneal Group designees would cause the size of the Board to increase to 15 members. Additionally, at any time after the earlier of May 4, 2019 or the date of appointment of a director designated by TPG, we will have the right under the Amneal charter to convert all of the outstanding shares of Class B-1 Common Stock, all of which are currently held by TPG, into shares of Class A Common Stock. If TPG exercises its right to designate a director, the TPG designee, and any corresponding additional Amneal Group designee, would be appointed to the Board after the conclusion of the 2019 annual meeting and serve for a term ending on the date of our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders or until his or her successor shall be elected and qualify or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
There are currently two observers to the Board, one has been designated by the Board of Directors and one has been designated by TPG.
For so long as the Amneal Group continues to beneficially own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company, the Amneal Group will have the right to designate for nomination the lowest number of designees that constitute a majority of the total number of directors comprising the Board. The Company will cause such nominee(s) to be included in any slate of nominees recommended by the Board to the stockholders of the Company for election. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the directors serving on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will be required to approve (i) a decision not to nominate any of the initial directors of the Company as of the closing of the Combination for re-election to the Board at either of the first two annual meetings of stockholders of the Company following the completion of the Combination and (ii) until the third annual meeting of stockholders of the Company following the completion of the Combination, any change to the individuals serving as Chairman or Co-Chairmen of the Company's Board.
If the Amneal Group beneficially owns 50% or less but more than 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company, the Amneal Group will have the right to designate a number of directors proportionate to the beneficial ownership of outstanding shares of the Company held by the Amneal Group (rounded up to the nearest whole number); provided, however, that such rounding shall not result in the Amneal Group having the right to designate a majority of the total number of directors comprising the Board when the Amneal Group beneficially owns 50% or less of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.
With respect to the Amneal Group Directors, until the date on which the Amneal Group ceases to beneficially own at least 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company (the "Trigger Date"), any vacancy will be filled by the Board with a director designated by the Amneal Group, except when such vacancy is created when the number of the Amneal Group Directors then serving on the Board is in excess of the number of Amneal Group designees the Amneal Group has the right to designate under the Company's Bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement.
With respect to the Non-Amneal Group Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Company's Board directors to fill any vacancy (other than the CEO of the Company) with a person who satisfies all the qualifications of a Company Independent Director (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement), subject to the prior written consent of the Conflicts Committee.
Board Committees
The Stockholders Agreement provides that the Company's Board shall initially have the following committees: (i) Audit Committee, (ii) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, (iii) Compensation Committee, (iv) Conflicts Committee, and (v) Integration Committee. The formation of, composition of, and amendment to the charter of any other committee requires the approval of 75% of the directors on the Company's Board. Until the Trigger Date, each committee of the Company's Board will include at least one director designated by the Amneal Group, subject to the applicable NYSE requirements. If at any time, any committee (other than the Conflicts Committee) does not have at least one such Amneal Group-designated director, the Amneal Group will be entitled to designate a director to have observer rights with respect to such committee. The formation and composition of any committee not specified above requires the approval of 75% of the Company's Board.
Amneal Group Agreement to Vote
Until the Trigger Date, the Amneal Group must cause its shares to be present for quorum purposes at any stockholders meeting, vote in favor of all director nominees recommended by the Company's Board, and not vote in favor of the removal of any Non-Amneal Group Director, unless such removal is recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Amneal Group Consent Rights
For so long as Amneal Group beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding shares of the Company, the Company will not take the following actions without obtaining prior consent of the Amneal Group:
Code of Business Conduct; Corporate Governance Guidelines; Board Committee Charters
We are committed to conducting every aspect of our business in an ethical, open and honest manner and in full compliance with the law, both in letter and in spirit. Our Code of Business Conduct applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, and lays out guidelines for our employees, officers and directors to follow as they conduct business on behalf of our Company. We have also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, together with our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Board committee charters, form the framework for the corporate governance of the Company. In addition, the Stockholders Agreement between the Company and the Amneal Group and the limited liability company agreement of Amneal set forth a number of corporate governance requirements with respect to the Company.
The full text of the Code of Business Conduct as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, Integration Committee Charter and Conflicts Committee Charter are available at the investors section of our web site, http://investors.amneal.com. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct that applies to our directors or executive officers, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, in the investors section of our web site. Stockholders may request free printed copies of the Code of Business Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Board committee charters by writing to: Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Attention: Secretary, 400 Crossing Boulevard, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 or corporatesecretary@amneal.com.
Controlled Company Status
The Amneal Group holds a majority of the voting power of our common stock and, pursuant to provisions set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement, the Amneal Group has the ability to designate and elect a majority of our directors. As a result, we are a "controlled company" as defined by NYSE listing rules and may avail ourselves of exemptions relating to the Board and certain Board committees. Despite the availability of such exemptions, our Board currently has a majority of independent directors, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee composed solely of independent directors. As permitted by NYSE listing rules for "controlled companies," the Compensation Committee is not composed solely of independent directors.
Role of the Board of Directors
In accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, our business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. Although our non-employee directors are not involved in our day-to-day operating details, they are kept informed of our business through written reports and documents provided to them regularly, as well as by operating, financial and other reports presented by our officers at meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board of Directors is led by an Executive Chairman, who is also an officer of the Company, two Co-Chairmen and a Lead Independent Director. Because none of the Executive Chairman and Co-Chairmen are independent directors, the independent directors of the Board have elected a lead director, who is independent. The Lead Independent Director's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, presiding over all meetings of the Board at which the Executive Chairman and Co-Chairmen are not present, including any executive sessions of independent directors, reviewing Board meeting schedules and agendas and acting as a liaison between the independent directors, Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman and Co-Chairmen. Our Chief Executive Officer does not hold a leadership position on the Board, but our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not prohibit him from doing so. The Board has determined that its leadership structure currently is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders because it allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day business and our Executive Chairman to manage the operations of the Board while providing independent Board leadership through the Lead Independent Director.
Meetings of the Board of Directors
From the inception of the Company in May 2018 through the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (fiscal 2018), the Board of Directors held 3 meetings. Each of the directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings held by the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors on which he or she served during fiscal 2018, in each case held during the period for which he or she was a director and committee member. Our non-employee directors meet regularly (at least quarterly) in executive session of the Board without employee directors or employees present, and our independent directors meet in executive session at least twice annually. The Lead Independent Director presides over executive sessions of the non-employee directors and the independent directors. Mr. Chirag Patel and Mr. Chintu Patel do not attend executive sessions of non-employee directors.
Communication with the Board of Directors; Director Attendance at Annual Meetings
Stockholders, employees and all other interested parties may communicate with a member or members or a committee of the Board of Directors by addressing their correspondence to the Board member or members or committee c/o Corporate Secretary, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 400 Crossing Boulevard, Bridgewater, NJ 08807 or by email to corporatesecretary@amneal.com. Our corporate secretary will review the correspondence and will determine, in his good faith judgment, which stockholder communications will be relayed to the Board of Directors, any committee or any director. Our corporate secretary has the authority to discard or disregard any inappropriate communications or to take other appropriate actions with respect to any such inappropriate communications. Subject to the foregoing, mail addressed to "Board of Directors" or "non-management directors" will be forwarded to the Lead Independent Director.
Recognizing that director attendance at our annual meetings can provide our stockholders with a valuable opportunity to communicate with Board members about issues affecting our Company, we encourage our directors to attend each annual meeting of stockholders. We anticipate that all directors will attend the 2019 annual meeting, which is our first annual meeting of stockholders following the Combination.
Director Independence
In making independence determinations, the Board of Directors observes all criteria for independence established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the NYSE, other governing laws and regulations, and the Stockholders Agreement. The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in making an independence determination. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, to be considered independent:
The Board of Directors, through its nominating and governance committee, annually reviews all relevant business relationships any director may have with our Company. As a result of its annual review, the Board has affirmatively determined that each of the following directors meets the independence tests under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, none of the following directors has a material relationship with the Company and, as a result, such directors are independent: Robert L. Burr, J. Kevin Buchi, Peter R. Terreri, Janet S. Vergis, Ted Nark, Emily Peterson Alva, Jean Selden Greene and Dharmendra Rama.
In making the foregoing independence determination, the Board of Directors considered the following relationships:
The Board considered each of these relationships in light of the Company's independence standards and determined that neither relationship constitutes a material relationship with the Company.
In addition to the director independence standards described above, the Stockholders Agreement imposes additional independence requirements that apply in certain circumstances. The Stockholders Agreement defines "Company Independent Director" as a director who:
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has five standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, an Integration Committee and a Conflicts Committee. The following table sets forth the members of each committee and the number of meetings held during fiscal 2018 for each of the Board's committees, as well as each director's status as either independent or not independent and either an Amneal Group Director or Non-Amneal Group Director.

Each director who serves on the Audit Committee is independent under the listing standards of the NYSE and as that term is used in Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. The Board of Directors has determined that Peter Terreri qualifies as an Audit Committee financial expert as that term is defined by applicable SEC regulations, and has designated Peter Terreri as the Audit Committee's financial expert.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the charter is available at the investor relations section of our website at https://investors.amneal.com/corporate-governance/policies. The report of the Audit Committee begins on page 59 of this proxy statement.

Three of the four directors who serve on the Compensation Committee are independent under the listing standards of the NYSE and applicable SEC regulations with respect to Compensation Committees. The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available at the investor relations section of our website at https://investors.amneal.com/corporate-governance/policies. The report of the Compensation Committee is on page 36 of this proxy statement.
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Amneal Group has the right to nominate two of the four directors serving on the Compensation Committee for so long as the Amneal Group beneficially owns more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company. The remaining directors are designated by a majority of the Company Independent Directors of the Company's Board.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The principal duties and responsibilities of the nominating and governance committee are as follows:
Each director who serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent under the listing standards of the NYSE. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available at the investor relations section of our website at https://investors.amneal.com/corporate-governance/policies.

The principal duties and responsibilities of the Integration Committee are to oversee and serve as an advisory committee to the Company's management in connection with the integration of the respective businesses and operations of Amneal and Impax following the Combination.
The Integration Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available at the investor relations section of our website https://investors.amneal.com/corporate-governance/policies.
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, for a minimum of two years following the completion of the Combination, the Integration Committee will serve as an advisory committee to management in connection with the integration of Impax and Amneal.
Conflicts Committee
The principal duties and responsibilities of the Conflicts Committee are to provide leadership and guidance to the Board and the Company regarding transactions or situations involving potential conflicts of interest between the Company and its related parties.

The responsibilities of the Conflicts Committee include approval of certain transfers of shares of the Company by an Amneal Group member to third parties, approval of any related party transactions, and approval of any material amendment to the Stockholders Agreement, as set forth in the Conflicts Committee Charter.
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Management is responsible for managing the day-to-day risks our Company faces. Our Board of Directors is responsible for:
Beyond these fundamental responsibilities for risk oversight, our Board concentrates on the broader implications of our strategic plans and allows the committees to focus on specific areas of risk. Our directors, through their risk oversight role, are responsible for confirming that the risk management processes designed and implemented by the Company's executive officers and other senior managers are consistent with the Company's corporate strategy and are functioning as directed.
The Board believes that full and open communication between management and the Board of Directors is essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our executive officers attend our quarterly Board meetings. In addition to making quarterly presentations at such meetings regarding our operations, our executive officers are available to discuss any questions or concerns raised by the Board relating to risk management and any other matters.
While the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at our Company, our Board committees assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk.
Audit Committee
In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee is required to, among other things, focus on the reasonableness of control processes for identifying and managing key business, financial and regulatory reporting risks. The Audit Committee is also mandated by its charter to discuss with management our Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including, as required by the NYSE, our risk assessment and risk management policies. The Audit Committee monitors our Company's credit risk, liquidity risk, regulatory risk, operational risk and enterprise risk by regular reviews with management, external auditors and our Company's internal audit function.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the evaluation and management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs. As a result of its evaluation, the Compensation Committee has concluded that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks associated with corporate governance, including Board structure, size, membership and succession planning for our directors and executive officers.
Integration Committee
The Integration Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks associated with the integration of Amneal and Impax.
Conflicts Committee

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers recommendations for directorships submitted by our stockholders. Stockholders who wish the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider their recommendations for nominees for the position of director should submit their recommendations, in accordance with the procedures (including the information requirements) set forth in our Bylaws, in writing to: Corporate Secretary, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 400 Crossing Boulevard, Bridgewater, NJ 08807. In order for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to have adequate time to consider such candidate for inclusion on the director nominee slate, the stockholder's notice should be received at the address above within the time period set forth in our Bylaws (see "Stockholder Proposals for Inclusion in Our 2020 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement and Proxy Card" below).
In its assessment of each potential candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the nominee's personal and professional integrity, ethics and values and ability to make mature business decisions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider the following criteria, as well as any other factor the committee deems relevant:
Nominees may also be recommended by directors, members of management, or, in some cases, by a third party firm. In identifying and considering candidates for nomination to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider, in addition to the requirements described above and set out in its charter, quality of experience, our needs and the range of knowledge, experience and diversity represented on the Board. Each director candidate is evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee based on the same criteria and in the same manner, regardless of whether the candidate was recommended by a stockholder or by others.
The Board of Directors does not have a formal policy on Board diversity as it relates to the selection of nominees for the Board. The Board believes that diversity and a variety of experiences and viewpoints should be represented on the Board. In selecting a director nominee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee focuses on skills, viewpoints, expertise or background that would complement the existing Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify candidates representing diverse experience at policy-making levels in business, management, marketing, finance, human resources, communications and other areas that are relevant to our activities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses its effectiveness in this regard when evaluating the composition of the Board.
In the case of a recommendation submitted by a stockholder, after full consideration, the stockholder proponent will be notified of the decision of the nominating and governance committee.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts the appropriate and necessary inquiries with respect to the backgrounds and qualifications of all director nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also reviews the independence of each candidate and other qualifications of all director candidates, as well as considers questions of possible conflicts of interest between director nominees and our Company. After the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has completed its review of a nominee's qualifications and conducted the appropriate inquiries, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes a determination whether to recommend the nominee for approval by the Board of Directors. If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee decides to recommend the director nominee for nomination by the Board of Directors and such recommendation is accepted by the Board, the form of our proxy solicitation will include the name of the director nominee.
Director Compensation
Each of our non-employee directors receives an annual fee payable in cash. In addition, so that our non-employee directors have an ownership interest aligned with our stockholders, each non-employee director also receives an annual grant of stock options and restricted stock units. Board members also receive an initial equity grant when they join the Board. Members of our Board committees receive an additional annual fee for each committee on which they serve, other than the Integration Committee. Our directors are entitled to reimbursement of their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with their travel to and attendance at Board and committee meetings. The compensation of our non-employee directors was reviewed by our independent compensation consultant in May 2018.
Our director compensation program is summarized in the table below.
During fiscal 2018, our non-employee directors received the following compensation:
Employee directors do not receive any separate compensation for their Board activities.
In order to further align the interests of our non-employee directors with the interests of our stockholders, we require our non-employee directors to own our stock as set forth below.
We adopted our stock ownership guidelines in May 2018, and we expect our non-employee directors to be able to achieve the required ownership thresholds by five years from the date of adoption of the guidelines. Newly elected directors will have five years from the date they became subject to the stock ownership guidelines to comply with them. For the purpose of determining stock ownership levels, we include shares underlying restricted stock and restricted stock units (whether or not vested) and shares underlying "in-the-money" vested stock option awards.
Proposal 1 Election of Directors
Introduction
Our Company's Bylaws provide for the annual election of directors. Upon the recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board of Directors has nominated for election each of our current directors.
At the annual meeting, the thirteen nominees for director are to be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Each of the nominees has consented to serve as a director if elected. If any of the nominees shall become unable or unwilling to stand for election as a director (an event not now anticipated by the Board of Directors), proxies will be voted for such substitute as designated by the Board of Directors, or, alternatively, the Board of Directors may reduce the number of directors on the Board, subject to the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement.
Director Nominees
For each of the thirteen director nominees standing for election, the following sets forth certain biographical information, including a description of their business experience during at least the past five years and the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that qualify them to serve as directors of the Company and/or members of the Board committees on which they serve. Each of the individuals listed below has been a director of the Company since the completion of the Combination. For further information, about how director nominees are selected, see "Corporate Governance–Director Nominations" above.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis contains statements regarding historical and future Company performance targets or goals. We have disclosed these targets or goals in the limited context of our compensation programs and they should not be understood to be statements of management's expectations or estimates of results. We specifically caution investors not to apply these statements to other contexts.

Introduction
In the paragraphs that follow, we will give an overview and analysis of our compensation program and policies, the material compensation decisions we have made under those programs and policies, and the material factors that we considered in making those decisions. Following this section you will find a series of tables containing specific information about the compensation earned or paid in fiscal 2018 to the following executive officers:
Throughout this proxy statement we refer to these individuals as our "named executive officers." The discussion below is intended to help you understand the detailed information provided in those tables and put that information into context within our overall compensation program.
Executive Summary
The primary objective of our executive compensation program is to provide compensation designed to:
The Compensation Committee aims to provide incentives for superior performance in a given year and over a sustained period by paying fair, reasonable and competitive compensation, and by basing a significant portion of our total compensation package upon achieving that performance (i.e., "pay for performance").
We also aim for simplicity in our compensation program so that it is easy for our employees and our stockholders to understand the various components of our compensation program and the incentives designed to drive Company performance. The three key components of our executive compensation program are base salary, annual cash performance based incentive and equity-based long-term incentive awards.
Although our compensation program has only been in place since May 2018, when we completed the Combination and became a new publicly traded company, we believe that the compensation program has been instrumental in helping the Company achieve financial and strategic goals, as evidenced by the following:

Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for setting and administering the policies that govern salary, annual and long-term incentive programs and other compensation and benefits for our executive officers. With respect to the compensation of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, which makes decisions on the basis of those recommendations. The Compensation Committee oversees various executive and employee compensation plans and programs, and it has responsibility for continually monitoring these plans and programs to confirm that they adhere to our compensation philosophy and objectives. Our Compensation Committee determines the appropriate compensation levels of executives, evaluates officer and director compensation plans, policies and programs, and reviews benefit plans for officers. Our Compensation Committee believes that the total compensation paid to our named executive officers should be fair, reasonable and competitive, and that a significant portion of the total compensation should be tied to our Company's annual and long-term performance.
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage the services of outside advisers, experts and others to assist the Compensation Committee, and believes that it is important to do so from time to time. See "Peer Group Surveys and the Role of Our Compensation Consultant" below.
Role of our Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions
Regarding most compensation matters, including executive compensation and our annual and long-term incentive plans, our Chief Executive Officer provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, however, does not delegate any of its functions to others in setting compensation for our named executive officers and directors.
The Compensation Committee makes all compensation decisions for the named executive officers other than our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for whom the Board of Directors makes compensation decisions with the advice of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the performance of, and evaluates the compensation of, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer based upon a combination of the achievement of corporate goals and individual performance. As part of its performance review process, the Compensation Committee solicits the input of the full Board of Directors. Our Chief Executive Officer annually reviews the performance of the other executive officers, other than our Executive Chairman. Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations on the basis of these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and incentive plan award amounts for the other executive officers, other than our Executive Chairman, and he presents his conclusions and recommendations to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee then exercises its judgment to make final compensation determinations. Neither the Executive Chairman nor Chief Executive Officer participates in the decision making regarding his own compensation and neither is present when his compensation is discussed. Our Compensation Committee reports the compensation decisions it has made with respect to our executive officers other than our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to the Board of Directors. With respect to the compensation of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors makes compensation decisions.
Peer Group Surveys and the Role of Our Compensation Consultant
Our Compensation Committee does not rely solely on surveys of compensation paid to similar executives in order to determine annual and long-term compensation for our named executive officers. However, in light of the compensation objectives described above, the
Compensation Committee does from time to time review peer group surveys as an independent measure to confirm that the compensation being set is fair, reasonable and competitive.
During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford, a business unit of Aon Plc, an independent executive compensation consulting firm, to prepare a peer group compensation survey based upon publicly available information prior to setting fiscal 2018 compensation for our executive officers. Radford's services to us are limited to advising the Compensation Committee with respect to executive  compensation and non-employee director compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates the independence of its consultant each year and has the final authority to hire and terminate the consultant. In considering Radford's independence, the Compensation Committee reviewed various factors relating to Radford and the individuals actually providing services to the Company, including those factors required by the SEC and the NYSE. Based on a review of these factors, the Compensation Committee has determined that Radford is independent and that Radford's engagement presented no conflicts of interest for 2018.
The peer group in 2018 consisted of 15 publicly traded pharmaceutical companies with revenues of $730 million to $6.5 billion and market capitalizations of $2 billion to $18.5 billion. The companies comprising our peer group are set forth below.
Components of Executive Compensation
Consistent with its pay for performance philosophy, the Compensation Committee believes that it is important to place at risk a greater percentage of executives' and senior managers' compensation than that of non-executives and non-senior managers by tying executives' and senior managers' compensation directly to the performance of the Company. Accordingly, as set forth in the charts below, a significant portion of executive compensation consists of annual and long-term incentives linked to the Company's financial performance and/or the performance of the Company's stock.
Base Salaries
We have entered into employment agreements with all of our named executive officers other than Mr. Hirt and Ms. Shah. For each of the named executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive officer's base salary is subject to annual increase at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors. Base salaries for our named executive officers reflect the scope and nature of each officer's responsibilities. Adjustments to base salary are based upon the named executive officer's past performance, expected future contributions, changes in responsibilities and internal pay equity. As discussed above, the Compensation Committee also from time to time reviews peer group surveys as an independent measure to confirm that any adjustments are fair, reasonable and competitive. The 2018 base salaries for Messrs. Stewart, Bisaro and Boyer were negotiated in connection with the employment agreements that were entered into in anticipation of the Combination. The 2018 base salaries for Messrs. Reasons and Hirt and Ms. Shah were unchanged from the base salaries they earned as pre-Combination employees of Impax (for Mr. Reasons) and Amneal (for Mr. Hirt and Ms. Shah).
The 2018 base salaries of our named executive officers are set forth below.
Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards
In order to align the interests of our stockholders with our compensation plans, we tie significant portions of our named executive officers' compensation to our annual and long-term financial, operating and stock price performance through annual cash and long-term equity incentives. The Compensation Committee's philosophy is that named executive officers should expect the level of their compensation to vary with performance, with compensation increasing when performance exceeds our internal targets and budgets and compensation decreasing when performance falls below these expectations.
Annual Performance-Based Cash Incentive Compensation
The Compensation Committee believes that, in order to reward performance and overall Company success, a portion of an executive officer's compensation should be tied to the achievement of the Company's goals and that individual's performance goals in the form of an annual cash incentive payment. The cash incentive payment is calculated as set forth below.
The Compensation Committee has chosen combined adjusted EBITDA (which we define as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as adjusted for certain other items described in our SEC filings, including stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and site closure expenses, restructuring and asset-related charges, loss on extinguishment of debt, inventory related charges, litigation, settlements and related charges, losses or gains on sales of assets, asset impairment charges, amortization of upfront payments, royalty expenses, foreign exchange losses or gains, loss on sale of international operations, R&D milestone payments, and change in value of contingent consideration), calculated on a combined basis to include the results of acquisitions during the year as if the transaction closing dates had occurred on the first day of 2018, as the target performance objective for the payment of awards under our annual cash incentive plan.
The Compensation Committee has selected adjusted EBITDA as the performance measure for the annual cash incentive plan because adjusted EBITDA growth most closely reflects our operating performance and is a key metric for driving the long-term strategic direction that the Board of Directors has set for our Company. Further, adjusted EBITDA growth is highly correlated to or reflective of our Company's financial and operational improvements, ability to generate cash flow from operations, growth and return to stockholders. We believe that EBITDA, as adjusted, is helpful in assessing the overall performance of our business, and is helpful in highlighting trends in our overall business because the items excluded in calculating adjusted EBITDA have little or no bearing on our day-to-day operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP valuation tool that potential investors use to measure our profitability against other companies in our industry.
Our adjusted EBITDA target for a given year is determined by the Compensation Committee based upon recommendations from and discussions with management, a review of current economic conditions and recent acquisition activity, and aligns with our external targets. Factors used by the Compensation Committee in setting adjusted EBITDA targets include, among others, the following:
Adjusted EBITDA is not a term defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
After the Compensation Committee reviews the final full year financial results of our Company, the Compensation Committee approves annual cash incentive payouts for the prior year. Annual cash incentive awards are generally paid in March.
No annual cash incentive payments are made unless the threshold adjusted EBITDA target has been achieved. Adjusted EBITDA targets under the annual cash incentive plan may be reset periodically within a fiscal year by the Compensation Committee to take into account acquisitions, divestitures and other unplanned events. No such adjustments were made for 2018. Subject to the provisions of an applicable employment agreement, executives generally must be employed on the last day of a plan year to receive an annual cash incentive award. The Compensation Committee may, however, at its discretion, pro rate awards in the event of certain circumstances such as the executive's promotion, demotion, death or retirement.
The Company performance component of the annual award each executive is eligible to receive is based upon a percentage of the executive's annualized base salary, with such percentage varying depending upon the level of adjusted EBITDA as compared to threshold, target and maximum adjusted EBITDA performance objectives as set forth in the table below.
The fiscal 2018 combined adjusted EBITDA threshold, target and maximum performance objectives were $312.5 million, $625 million and $937.5 million. Our Company's fiscal 2018 combined adjusted EBITDA was $584.3 million, or 94% of the target amount.
The 2018 annual performance-based cash incentive program also provides for an individual performance modifier which may adjust up or down from 0% to 150% based on an individual's performance during the year.
Therefore, as reflected in the non-equity incentive plan compensation column in the summary compensation table below and consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, the named executive officers received the incentive awards set forth below.
Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Our long-term incentive compensation program is designed to promote a balanced focus on driving performance, retaining talent and aligning the interests of our executives with those of our other stockholders. The Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2018 Incentive Award Plan authorizes the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, other stock or cash based awards and dividend equivalent awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. For 2018, our long-term incentive compensation program was comprised of two components: restricted stock units and stock options. We grant stock options to incentivize stock price performance as they have value only to the extent that the price of our common stock rises between the grant date and the exercise date, and we grant restricted stock unit awards as a retention tool as they provide the opportunity to receive stock only if the recipient is still employed by us on the date the restrictions lapse. For those named executive officers with employment agreements (as discussed below), the specific ratio of stock options and restricted stock units awarded in 2018 was the result of individual negotiations. For our other named executive officers, in 2018 stock options constituted 67% of the long-term incentive awards and restricted stock units constituted 33% of the long-term incentive awards. Half of Mr. Stewart's restricted stock units were granted as a sign on bonus to compensate him for lost compensation from his previous employer and thus his mix of award types is different from the other named executive officers.
The mix of different types of awards was intended to combine the retention and downside risk benefits inherent in restricted stock units with the shareholder-value-creation benefits inherent in stock options, while mitigating the perceived excessive risk that potentially manifests itself through a single type of award approach. Option awards produce value only if the price of the Company's stock appreciates, and then only to the extent of the excess of the Company's stock price over the exercise price of the option.
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee added performance-based restricted stock units to the mix of grants that our executive officers receive, and the total value of the each executive officer's equity grants was, for 2019, divided evenly between stock options, restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units.
Subject to adjustment as provided in the plan, the total number of shares of common stock available for awards under the plan is 23,000,000. As of February 28, 2019, 5,092,040 shares of common stock have been issued under the plan since it was originally adopted in 2018 and 17,907,960 shares remain available for issuance.
Annual Stock Option Grants
Our Compensation Committee has made annual and new hire grants of stock options to our named executive officers and certain other members of senior management. The stock options have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. In 2018, stock option grants were made in May, following the closing of the Combination. We expect to make future annual stock option grants in March. New hire stock option grants are made within a certain amount of time after commencement of employment. The stock options vest in four equal installments on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to cancellation or acceleration as provided in the individual stock option agreements. The number of stock options granted to each executive officer and senior manager is based upon the grant date fair value of the stock options.
Other Compensation and Benefits
Benefits offered to our named executive officers serve a different purpose than do the other elements of total compensation. In general, they are provided for the convenience of the Company or are designed to provide a safety net of protection against the financial catastrophes that can result from illness, disability or death. Benefits offered to our named executive officers are the same as those offered to the general employee population, except for the car service provided to our Chief Executive Officer, which is reflected in the "all other compensation" column in the summary compensation table below.
The following table sets forth the grant date fair market value of stock options granted in 2018 for each of the named executive officers:
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Our Compensation Committee has made annual and new hire grants of restricted stock unit awards to our named executive officers and certain other members of senior management. In 2018, restricted stock unit grants were made in May, following the closing of the Combination. We expect to make future annual restricted stock unit grants in March. New hire restricted stock unit awards are made within a certain amount of time after commencement of employment. The restricted stock unit awards vest in four equal installments on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary of the grant date, subject to cancellation or acceleration as provided in the individual restricted stock unit award agreements. The number of restricted stock unit awards granted to each executive officer and senior manager is based upon the grant date fair value of the restricted stock units.
The following table sets forth the grant date fair market value of restricted stock unit awards granted in 2018 for each of the named executive officers:
Under the Company's 401(k) plan, the Company makes a 100% matching contribution with respect to each participant's elective contributions, up to 5% percent of such participant's compensation (provided that for fiscal 2018, matching contributions were based only on the first $275,000 of such participant's compensation). Matching contributions become fully vested after 3 years of employment with the Company.
The Company also has a deferred compensation plan for certain former executives and employees of Impax, some of whom are currently employed by the Company. In December 2018, we announced that we will no longer accept contributions from employees or make matching contributions for the deferred compensation plan. Of our named executive officers, only Mr. Reasons participated in the deferred compensation plan.
Executive Severance and Change in Control Severance Benefits
For a discussion of executive severance and change in control severance benefits, our rationale for offering those benefits and the triggers for payments, see "Management Employment Agreements—Severance Benefits" below.
Chief Executive Officer Compensation
The Board of Directors remains responsible for reviewing and approving the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer's compensation and evaluating our Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of those goals and objectives. Mr. Stewart has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since the Company's inception in May 2018. Mr. Stewart's compensation during fiscal 2018 was based upon his employment agreement and the other factors set forth above under "Components of Executive Compensation."
Accounting and Tax Considerations
Financial reporting and income tax consequences to our Company of individual compensation elements are important considerations for our Compensation Committee when it is analyzing the overall level of compensation and the mix of compensation. Overall, the Compensation Committee seeks to balance its objective of maintaining a fair, reasonable and competitive compensation package for our named executive officers with enabling the deductibility of compensation.
Executive Compensation Clawback Policy
We do not currently have an executive compensation clawback policy. However, the Compensation Committee plans to adopt a clawback policy after the SEC issues final rules implementing the clawback provisions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As of the end of 2018, the SEC had not yet issued final rules.
Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers
In order to further align the interests of our management with the interests of our stockholders, we require our executive officers to own our stock as set forth below.
We adopted our stock ownership guidelines in May 2018, and we expect our executive officers to be able to achieve the required ownership thresholds by five years from the date of adoption of the guidelines. Newly appointed officers will have five years from the date they became subject to the stock ownership guidelines to comply with them. For the purpose of determining stock ownership levels, we include shares underlying restricted stock and restricted stock units (whether or not vested) and shares underlying "in-the-money" vested stock option awards.
See "Corporate Governance—Director Compensation—Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines" above for a description of stock ownership guidelines we have adopted for our non-employee directors.
Anti-Hedging Policy
To prevent speculation or hedging, our insider trading policy prohibits our named executive officers (and our directors and all other employees) from engaging in short sales of our Company's stock. Company policy also prohibits our directors, executive officers and certain other employees from purchasing or selling any financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our Company's stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and other derivative securities that are directly linked to our Company's stock. All other employees are discouraged from entering into hedging transactions related to Company stock.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee is now, or was during fiscal 2018 or at any time prior thereto, an officer or employee of our Company or any of our subsidiaries. In addition, none of the executive officers of our Company currently serves or has served in the past on the board of directors or compensation committee of another company at any time during which an executive officer of such other company served on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee.
Report of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. This report is provided by the following directors, who comprise the committee.

Executive Compensation
Summary Compensation Table
The following table shows the compensation of our named executive officers for the periods presented. For Messrs. Stewart, Boyer and Hirt and Ms. Shah, we report compensation from the completion of the Combination to the end of 2018. For Messrs. Bisaro and Reasons, because they were named executive officers in our previous SEC filings that required compensation disclosure, we report compensation for periods prior to the completion of the Combination.
Grants of Plan Based Awards in 2018
The following table sets forth information about non-equity and equity awards granted to the named executive officers in fiscal 2018.
Outstanding Equity Awards at December 31,  
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for The Company has a deferred compensation plan for certain former executives and employees of Impax, some of whom are currently employed by the Company. In December 2018, the Company announced that it will no longer accept contributions from employees or make matching contributions for the deferred compensation plan. Of the named executive officers, only Mr. Reasons, who stepped down from the Company in February 2019, participated in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
The Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan permitted highly compensated individuals to receive a similar level of benefits (in terms of the overall percentage of their income eligible for tax deferral and employer matching contributions) as were available to employees with lower levels of income. Each participant could defer up to 75% of the participant's base salary and up to 100% of the amount of the participant's bonus or cash incentive awards. The Company made a matching contribution for each participant equal to 50% of the participant's contribution up to 10% of base salary and bonus and cash incentive awards per year. A participant's account was notionally invested in one or more investment funds and the value of the account was determined with respect to such investment allocations. Participants were fully vested in their contributions when made. The Company's matching contributions vested depending on the number of years of service, with participants being fully vested after five years of service. No contributions were forfeited as a result of a separation due to death, disability, termination of the plan or a change in control.
Benefits attributable to a participant were valued as if they were invested in one or more investment funds, as directed by participants in writing. The investment funds and their annual rates of return for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are contained in the table below. Participants could change their selection of investment funds from time to time in writing in accordance with the procedure established by the plan administrator. Changes took effect as soon as administratively practicable.
If a participant terminated his or her employment for any reason, including death, Impax would pay the participant an amount equal to the value of the vested balance credited to the participant's plan account. If the participant died, the balance of that account would be paid to one or more beneficiaries designated by the participant.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
To enable us to offer a competitive executive compensation program, we believe it is important to provide reasonable severance benefits to our executive officers.
In addition to the employment agreements between the Company and certain of our named executive officers, discussed above, the Company has a severance plan that provides for severance benefits to our employees (the "Severance Plan"). Under the Severance Plan, in the event of a participant's termination of employment without cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) or for good reason (as defined in the Severance Plan), in either case on or within 12 months after the date of the completion of the Combination, the participant will be eligible to receive up to a maximum of (depending on his or her position) (i) a lump sum payment of 52 weeks of his or her base pay, (ii) his or her annual target bonus, (iii) partially subsidized COBRA premiums for 52 weeks and (iv) outplacement services for 26 weeks.
Moreover, from time to time, we may explore potential transactions that could result in a change in control of our Company. We believe that when a transaction is perceived as imminent, or is taking place, we should be able to receive and rely on the disinterested service of our executive officers, without them being distracted or concerned by the personal uncertainties and risks associated with such a situation. We further believe that our stockholders are best served if their interests are aligned with the interests of our executives, and providing change in control benefits should eliminate, or at least reduce, the reluctance of senior management to pursue potential transactions that may enhance the value of our stockholders' investments. Consistent with this, we provide change-in-control benefits to our named executive officers only if the officer's employment terminates in connection with the change in control (often referred to as "double-trigger" change-in-control benefits).
The estimated severance and other benefits for each named executive officer, either pursuant to the Severance Plan or an applicable employment agreement, in the event of a termination of employment are set forth below. The amounts assume that the termination was effective as of December 31, 2018 (the last business day of fiscal 2018) and thus are based upon amounts earned through such date and are only estimates of the amounts that would actually be paid to such named executive officers upon their termination. Since many factors (e.g., the time of year when the event occurs, the Company's stock price) could affect the nature and amount of benefits a named executive officer could potentially receive, any amounts paid or distributed upon a future termination may be different from those shown in the table below. The amounts shown are in addition to benefits generally available to salaried employees.
Release
The obligation of the Company to provide the salary continuation and other severance benefits described above is contingent upon and subject to the execution and delivery by the executive officer of a general release of claims against the Company.
Proposal 2 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
Introduction
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules.
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs, which are guided by the principal of "pay for performance," are designed to attract, motivate, and retain our named executive officers, reinforce the execution of our business strategy and the achievement of our business objectives; and align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value. Under these programs, our named executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of annual and long-term goals and the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 27 for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal 2018 compensation of our named executive officers.
We believe that our compensation program has been instrumental in helping the Company achieve strong financial performance. Therefore, we are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say on pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
The say on pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on our Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. However, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote and the concerns of our stockholders when making future decisions on the compensation of our named executive officers and our Company's compensation principles, policies and procedures.
In accordance with Proposal No. 3 below, we expect that the next advisory vote to approve executive compensation will occur at our 2020 Annual Meeting.
Required Vote
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Proposal 3 Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future "Say on Pay" Votes
Introduction
The Dodd-Frank Act also enables our stockholders to indicate how frequently we should seek an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules (such as Proposal No. 2 included on page 46 of this proxy statement). By voting on this Proposal No. 3, stockholders may indicate whether they prefer an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation to be held every one year, every two years or every three years.
After careful consideration of this proposal, our Board of Directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs every year is the most appropriate alternative for the Company, and therefore our Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favor of holding the advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis.
You may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years, three years or abstain from voting.
Required Vote
The frequency option that receives the most votes cast will be considered to be the frequency that has been selected by our stockholders. However, because this vote is advisory and not binding on the Board of Directors or the Company in any way, our Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by our stockholders.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Section 16 Compliance
Beneficial Ownership
The following table sets forth information as of March 15, 2019, with respect to the beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class B-1 common stock, and shows the number of and percentage owned by:
Beneficial ownership of shares is determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power.

Amneal will not be required to make distributions to the extent that such distributions would render Amneal insolvent or if such distribution would violate any applicable law or the terms of the any credit agreement in existence at Closing.
Tax Distributions
In connection with any tax period, Amneal is required to make distributions to its members, on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Amneal Common Units held by each member, of cash until each member (other than the Company) has received an amount at least equal to its assumed tax liability and the Company has received an amount sufficient to enable it to timely satisfy all of its U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax liabilities, and meet its obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent that any member does not receive its percent interest of the aggregate tax distribution, the tax distribution for such member will be increased to ensure that all distributions are made pro rata in accordance with such member's percentage interest.
Repurchase or Redemption of Amneal Common Units
Upon written notice to Amneal and the Company, each member is entitled to cause Amneal to effect a redemption (a "Redemption") of all or any portion of its Amneal Common Units in exchange for the number of shares of Class A common stock or Class B-1 common stock equal to the number of redeemed Amneal Common Units (the "Share Settlement") or, at Amneal's election, cash in an amount equal to the product of the Share Settlement and the average of the volume-weighted closing price for a share of Class A common stock on the NYSE for the five consecutive full trading days ending on and including the last full trading day immediately prior to the redemption notice date, subject to appropriate and equitable adjustment for any stock splits, reverse splits, stock dividends or similar events affecting the Class A common stock (the "Cash Settlement"). The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to effect the exchange of the redeemed Amneal Common Units for the Share Settlement or Cash Settlement, at the Company's option, through a direct exchange of such redeemed Amneal Common Units and such consideration between the redeemed member and the Company.
Transfer Restrictions
No interest in Amneal may be transferred except as permitted under the LLC Agreement. The LLC Agreement permits transfers:
Dissolution
The LLC Agreement provides that the unanimous consent of at least 75% of all members holding Amneal Common Units will be required to voluntarily dissolve Amneal. In addition to a voluntary dissolution, Amneal may be dissolved upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution or upon other circumstances in accordance with Delaware law. Upon a dissolution event, the proceeds of liquidation will be distributed in the following order: (i) to pay the expenses of winding up Amneal; (ii) to pay debts and liabilities owed to creditors of Amneal; and (iii) to the members pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage ownership interests in Amneal.
Corporate Opportunities and Waiver of Fiduciary Duty
The LLC Agreement provides that, notwithstanding any duty, including fiduciary duty, otherwise applicable at law or in equity, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, will not apply to any member or related person of such member, and no member or related person of such member that acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for Amneal or the members will have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to Amneal or the members, or to develop any particular investment, and such person will not be liable to Amneal or the members for breach of any fiduciary or other duty (other than fiduciary duties owed to the Company) by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires for, or directs such opportunity to, another person or does not communicate such investment opportunity to the members.
Indemnification and D&O Insurance
Amneal will indemnify any member or affiliate, the managing member or any of its affiliates, any officer, or individual serving at the request of Amneal as an officer, director, principal, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise. Such persons will be entitled to payment in advance of expenses, including attorneys' fees, that they incur in defending a proceeding, but they will be required to repay any such advance if it is ultimately determined that they were not entitled to indemnification by Amneal. Indemnification will not be available for any expenses, liabilities, damages and losses suffered that are attributable to any such person's or its affiliates' gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violation of the law or for any present or future breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants contained in the LLC Agreement or in other agreements with Amneal.
Tax Classification
The members intend that Amneal be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and, if applicable, state or local income tax purposes. Each member and Amneal will file all tax returns and will take all tax and financial reporting positions in a manner consistent with such tax treatment.
Amendments
The LLC Agreement may only be amended in writing by the manager with the written consent of the holders of at least 75% of the Amneal Common Units then outstanding.
Report of the Audit Committee
Under the guidance of a written charter adopted by our Board of Directors, the Audit Committee oversees our management's conduct of the financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. A copy of the charter is available at the investor relations section of our Company's website, http://investors.amneal.com. The Audit Committee also appoints the independent registered public accounting firm to be retained to audit our Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, and once retained, the independent registered public accounting firm reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for pre-approving both audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's charter reflects the above-mentioned responsibilities, and the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors periodically review and revise the charter.
Management is responsible for our company's financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. It is not the Audit Committee's duty or responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews.
The Audit Committee meets at least four times annually, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. During fiscal 2018, and since becoming a publicly traded company on May 7, 2018, the Audit Committee met 5 times. The Audit Committee also met with management periodically to consider the adequacy of our company's internal controls and discussed these matters and the overall scope and plans for the audit of our Company with our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee met with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examination and the overall quality of our financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with senior management our Company's disclosure controls and procedures and the certifications by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, which are required by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for certain of our Company's filings with the SEC. The Audit Committee also met separately from time to time with our chief financial officer and with our chief legal officer/general counsel, and at least quarterly, the Audit Committee met in executive session.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the audited consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and management's assessment of the effectiveness of our Company's internal control over financial as of December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from our Company and our management, including the matters in the written disclosures and letter which were received by the Audit Committee from the independent registered public accounting firm as required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with Ernst & Young LLP's independence. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Proposal 4 Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Introduction
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, our Board of Directors is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
One or more representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the annual meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees
In addition to performing the audit of our consolidated financial statements, Ernst & Young has provided various other services during fiscal 2018 and 2017. The aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed for fiscal 2018 and 2017 for each of the following categories of services are as follows:
In accordance with the SEC's definitions and rules the terms in the above table have the following meanings:
"Audit Fees" are the aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed for each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young for the audit of our consolidated financial statements included in our annual reports on Form 10-K and review of the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; SEC registration statements including consents and review of documents filed with the SEC, consultation on accounting standards or transactions, and for services in connection with statutory or regulatory filings or engagements; and for services that are normally provided by Ernst & Young in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for fiscal 2018 and 2017.
"Audit-Related Fees" are the aggregate fees billed in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 for assurance and related services by Ernst & Young that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements. There were no audit related fees for 2018. Audit related fees for 2017 relate to due diligence services in connection with mergers and acquisitions.
"Tax Fees" are the aggregate fees billed in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.
"All Other Fees" are the aggregate fees billed in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 for products and services provided by Ernst & Young not included in the first three categories.
The Audit Committee has reviewed summaries of the services provided by Ernst & Young and the related fees, and the Audit Committee has determined that the provision of the non-audit services described above is compatible in maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young.
Our Audit Committee was established in May 2018 upon the completion of the Combination. All of the services described above that required pre-approval were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with its pre-approval policy. The Audit Committee pre-approval policy provides that all auditing services and all non-audit services to be provided by Ernst & Young be pre-approved by the Audit Committee, provided that the Audit Committee shall not approve any non-audit services prohibited by Section 10A(g) of the Exchange Act.
Required Vote
Ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Other Matters
Our management is not aware of any other matters to be presented for action at the annual meeting; however, if any such matters are properly presented for action, it is the intention of the proxy appointees to vote in accordance with their best judgment on such matters.
About the Meeting
Why am I receiving these materials?
This proxy statement is provided to the stockholders of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors to be voted at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held at the Bridgewater Marriott, 700 Commons Way, Bridgewater, NJ 08807, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on Monday, May 6, 2019, and at any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. This proxy statement provides important information that you should consider in deciding how to vote on the matters to be voted on at the annual meeting.
What items will be voted on at the annual meeting?
At the annual meeting, the stockholders will consider and vote upon:
If you received a paper copy of these materials by mail, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or a voting instruction card for the annual meeting.
What is a proxy statement? What information is contained in this proxy statement?
It is a document that Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating proxies to vote on your behalf. The information in this proxy statement relates to the proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting, the voting process, the Company's Board of Directors and Board committees, the compensation of our directors and executive officers for fiscal 2018 and other required information.
Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials?
We are pleased to be using the SEC rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials to stockholders over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to most of our stockholders a notice about the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. We believe that this process allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need in a timelier manner, while reducing the environmental impact and lowering the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. All stockholders receiving the notice will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the notice.
How can I access the proxy materials over the Internet?
The notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and annual report are available at www.proxyvote.com. Instead of receiving future copies of the proxy materials by mail, most beneficial owners can elect to receive an email that will provide electronic links to these documents. Opting to receive your proxy materials online will save us the cost of producing and mailing documents to your home or business, and also will give you an electronic link to the proxy voting site. If you received a notice of the Internet availability of proxy materials, that notice will contain additional instructions on how to view our proxy materials on the Internet.
How may I obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials?
Stockholders receiving a notice about the Internet availability of the proxy materials will find instructions about how to obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials on that notice. All stockholders who do not receive a notice will receive a copy of the proxy materials by mail or email.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or with a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares.
Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting?
Each holder of record of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on March 15, 2019 is entitled to vote at the annual meeting (Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to herein as the "voting common stock"). Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as a single class. Holders of our Class B-1 common stock are not entitled to vote on the matters being brought before the annual meeting. As of March 15, 2019, a total of 115,527,835 shares of Class A common stock and 170,940,707 shares of Class B common stock were outstanding and are eligible to vote at the annual meeting. Each share of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters with respect to which holders are entitled to vote.
How do I vote?
Your shares may only be voted at the annual meeting if you are present in person or are represented by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we encourage you to vote by proxy in advance of the annual meeting to assure that your shares will be represented. Voting by proxy will in no way limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you later decide to attend in person. Please follow the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability, proxy card or voting instruction form for information on how you can cast your vote in advance of the annual meeting.
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares?
Stockholders of Record
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by timely submission of a written revocation to our corporate secretary, submission of a properly executed later-dated proxy, or by voting by ballot at the annual meeting. Attendance at the annual meeting will not by itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.
Beneficial Owners
If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other holder of record, that institution will instruct you as to how your vote may be changed and the deadline for doing so.
If I am a stockholder of record, how will my shares be voted if I sign, date and return my proxy card? What if I do not specify a choice for a matter when returning my signed proxy card?
All shares entitled to vote that are represented by properly completed proxy cards received prior to the annual meeting and not revoked will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your instructions. If you sign and return a proxy card but do not indicate how your shares should be voted, the shares represented by your proxy card will be voted in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations on Proposals 1-4 and in the discretion of the persons designated as proxies as to any other matter that may properly come before the annual meeting.
What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker?
As a beneficial owner, to make sure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee.
If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your shares cannot be voted on any of the voting items other than the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as independent registered public accounting firm.
Who may attend the annual meeting?
All stockholders that were our stockholders as of the record date (March 15, 2019) or their authorized representatives may attend the annual meeting. Each shareholder may appoint only one proxy holder or representative to attend the meeting on his or her behalf. Admission to the meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. You must bring a government-issued photo identification in order to be admitted to the meeting. In addition, if your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee and you plan to attend the annual meeting, you must also bring proof of ownership as of the record date, such as a brokerage or bank account statement. If you are a beneficial owner and you would like to vote your shares at the meeting, you must also bring proof of your authority to vote your shares (which we refer to as a "legal proxy") from your broker, bank or other nominee. To request a legal proxy, please follow the instructions at www.proxyvote.com.
How will votes be counted?
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of voting common stock of our Company entitled to vote on a particular matter will constitute a quorum for the purpose of considering that matter. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee, such as a bank or broker, holding shares for a beneficial owner, does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner (see "What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker?" above).
To be elected, a nominee for director must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such nominee. Approval of each of Proposal Nos. 2 and 4 require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote. For Proposal No. 3, the frequency option that receives the most votes cast will be considered to be the frequency that has been selected by our stockholders. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the vote for Proposal Nos. 1 and 3, but will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" for Proposal Nos. 2 and 4. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote for Proposal Nos. 1 through 4.
Who will count the votes?
A representative of American Election Services, LLC will tally the vote and will serve as inspector of the annual meeting.
How are proxies being solicited and who will pay for the solicitation of proxies?
We will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, solicitation may be made by our directors, officers and employees by other means, including telephone, over the Internet or in person. No special compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or employees for the solicitation of proxies. To solicit proxies, we will also request the assistance of brokerage houses, banks and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries, and, upon request, will reimburse such organizations or individuals for their reasonable expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners and in obtaining authorization for the execution of proxies.
Additional Information
Stockholder Proposals for Inclusion in Our 2020 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement and Proxy Card
Under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, any stockholder proposal to be considered by us for inclusion in our 2020 proxy statement and form of proxy card for next year's annual meeting of stockholders, expected to be held in May 2020, must be received by our corporate secretary at our principal executive offices located at 400 Crossing Boulevard, Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807, not later than November 25, 2019 and must otherwise comply with Rule 14a-8. While the Board will consider stockholder proposals that we receive, we reserve the right to omit from our proxy statement stockholder proposals that do not satisfy applicable SEC rules.
Director Nominations and Other Proposals to be Presented at Our 2020 Annual Meeting
In addition, our Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to stockholder nominations for director or any other stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders that will not be included in our proxy statement. In general, notice must be received by our corporate secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders and must contain specified information concerning the matters to be brought before the meeting and concerning the stockholder making the proposal. If no annual meeting was held in the previous year or if the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 calendar days earlier or more than 60 calendar days later than such anniversary date, notice must be received not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 calendar days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th calendar day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the Company. Therefore, to be presented at next year's annual meeting, director nominations and stockholder proposals that will not be included in our proxy statement must be received at by our corporate secretary at the address above on or after January 7, 2020 but not later than February 6, 2020 and must contain the information specified in our Bylaws. A nomination or proposal also must comply with the additional procedures set forth in our Bylaws.
Householding
Some brokers, banks and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports or notices of Internet availability of proxy materials, as applicable. This means that only one copy of such items may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. We will promptly deliver, without charge, a separate copy of these documents to you if you so request by writing or calling as follows: Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 400 Crossing Boulevard, Bridgewater, NJ 08807; telephone, (908) 947-3120. If you want to receive separate copies of the annual report and proxy statement or notice of Internet availability of proxy materials, as applicable, in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee record holder, or you may contact us at the above address and phone number.
Appendix A Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This Proxy Statement includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, that are intended as supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this release includes these non-GAAP measures and our reported results on a non-GAAP combined basis to include the results of Impax and Gemini as if the transaction closing dates had occurred on the first day of all periods presented herein. Management uses these non-GAAP historical and combined measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company's operations and to better understand its business because they facilitate a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance relative to its performance based on results under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures also isolate the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the Company's operations and underlying operational performance. The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate management's performance and set its compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures also provide useful information to investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and operating results, and doing so on a combined basis facilitates an evaluation of the financial performance of the Company and its operations on a consistent basis. Providing this information therefore allows investors to make independent assessments of the Company's financial performance, results of operation and trends while viewing the information through the eyes of management.
The calculation of Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of Class A Common Stock.
These non-GAAP measures are subject to limitations. The non-GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate one or more in the same manner. Additionally, the non-GAAP performance measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and do not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt. Further, the combined results may not represent what our combined results of operations and financial position would have been had the transactions occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they intended to project our combined results of operations or financial position for any future period. To compensate for these limitations, management presents and considers these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the Company's GAAP results; no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation from or as alternatives to net income, diluted earnings per share or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations of below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.
A reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is set forth below.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Combined Net Revenue
(Unaudited; In thousands)
Non-GAAP Reconciliations
(Unaudited; In thousands, Except per Share Amounts)
