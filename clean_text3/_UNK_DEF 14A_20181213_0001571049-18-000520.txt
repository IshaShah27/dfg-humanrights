PROXY STATEMENT 
INTRODUCTION 
The accompanying proxy, mailed together with this proxy statement, is solicited by and on behalf of the board of directors (the "Board of Directors") of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (which we refer to in this proxy statement as the "Company"), for use at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. References in this proxy statement to "we," "us," "our" or like terms also refer to the Company, and references in this proxy statement to "you" refer to the stockholders of the Company. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701. This proxy statement, the accompanying proxy card and notice of annual meeting are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about October 29, 2018. The 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K was previously mailed to our stockholders on or about April 30, 2018. 
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the exhibits thereto may be accessed online through the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") website at www.sec.gov. In addition, stockholders may request a copy of our 2017 Annual Report by writing or telephoning us at the following address: Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, telephone (866) 792-8700. 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING 
What is the date of the annual meeting and where will it be held? 
Our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on December 13, 2018, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time. The meeting will be held at 460 Park Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York, 10022. 
What will I be voting on at the meeting? 
At the meeting, you will be asked to: 
 consider and vote upon the election of three directors to serve until our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; and 
​
 conduct such other business as may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
​
The Board of Directors does not know of any matters that may be considered at the meeting other than the matters set forth in the items listed above. 
Who can vote at the meeting? 
The record date for the determination of holders of shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting, is the close of business on October 10, 2018. Accordingly, any holder of shares of Common Stock on the record date is entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the record date, approximately 17.9 million shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. 
How many votes do I have? 
Each share of Common Stock has one vote on each matter considered at the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
How can I vote? 
You may vote in person at the meeting or by proxy. Stockholders may submit their votes by proxy by mail by completing, signing, dating and returning their proxy in the enclosed envelope. Stockholders also have the following two options for authorizing a proxy to vote their shares: 
 via the Internet at www.proxy-direct.com/; or 
​
 by telephone, by calling toll free (800) 337-3503. 
​
For those stockholders with Internet access, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet, a convenient means of authorizing a proxy that also provides cost savings to us. In addition, when you authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or by telephone prior to the meeting date, your proxy authorization is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your vote by proxy to arrive late and, therefore, not be counted. For further instructions on authorizing a proxy to vote your shares, see your proxy card enclosed with this proxy statement. You may also vote your shares at the meeting. If you attend the meeting, you may submit your vote in person, and any proxy that you authorized by mail, Internet or telephone will be superseded by the vote that you cast at the meeting. 
How will proxies be voted? 
Shares represented by valid proxies will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the directions given. If the enclosed proxy card is signed and returned without any directions given, the shares will be voted FOR each of the three nominees for director named in this proxy statement for election as director. 
The Board of Directors does not intend to present, and has no information indicating that others will present, any business at the annual meeting other than as set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if other matters requiring the vote of our stockholders come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the proxies held by them in their discretion. 
How can I change my vote or revoke a proxy? 
You have the unconditional right to revoke your proxy at any time prior to the voting thereof by (i) submitting a later-dated proxy either by telephone, via the Internet or in the mail to Computershare Fund Services ("CFS"), whom we have retained to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at the following address: Proxy Tabulator, 2950 Express Drive South, Suite 210, Islandia, NY 11749, (ii) attending the meeting and voting in person or (iii) providing written notice to CFS. No written revocation of your proxy shall be effective, however, unless and until it is received at or prior to the meeting. Your attendance at the meeting without voting will not be sufficient to revoke a previous proxy authorization. 
What if I return my proxy but do not mark it to show how I am voting? 
If your proxy card is signed and returned without specifying your choices, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors. 
What are the board's recommendations? 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR each of the three nominees for director named in this proxy statement for election as director. 
What votes are required to elect directors? 
There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors. Each director is elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares of Common Stock entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at the meeting. Any shares deemed present at the meeting but not voted (whether by abstention or broker non-vote) have the same impact as a vote against the directors. A "broker  TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-vote" occurs when a broker who holds shares for the beneficial owner is deemed present for purposes of establishing a quorum for the meeting but does not vote on a proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting authority for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. 
What constitutes a "quorum"? 
The presence at the meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum. 
Will you incur expenses in soliciting proxies? 
We will bear all costs associated with soliciting proxies for the meeting. Solicitations may be made on behalf of the Board of Directors by mail, personal interview, telephone or other electronic means by our officers and other employees of Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, LLC (the "Advisor"), who will receive no additional compensation. We will request banks, brokers, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other record holders to forward copies of this proxy statement to people on whose behalf they hold shares of Common Stock and to request authority for the exercise of proxies by the record holders on behalf of those people. In compliance with the regulations of the SEC, we will reimburse such persons for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares of our Common Stock. 
We have also retained CFS to aid in the solicitation of proxies. We will pay CFS a fee of approximately $35,000 in addition to reimbursement of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. As the date of the meeting approaches, certain stockholders may receive a telephone call from a representative of CFS if their votes have not yet been received. Proxies that are obtained telephonically will be recorded in accordance with the procedures described below. The Board of Directors believes that these procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that both the identity of the stockholder casting the vote and the voting instructions of the stockholder are accurately determined. 
In all cases where a telephonic proxy is solicited, the CFS representative is required to ask for each stockholder's full name and address, or the zip code or employer identification number, and to confirm that the stockholder has received the proxy materials in the mail. If the stockholder is a corporation or other entity, the CFS representative is required to ask for the person's title and confirmation that the person is authorized to direct the voting of the shares. If the information solicited agrees with the information provided to CFS, then the CFS representative has the responsibility to explain the process, read the proposal listed on the proxy card and ask for the stockholder's instructions on the proposal. Although the CFS representative is permitted to answer questions about the process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the stockholder how to vote, other than to read any recommendation set forth in this proxy statement. CFS will record the stockholder's instructions on the card. Within 72 hours, the stockholder will be sent a letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the stockholder to call CFS immediately if his or her instructions are not correctly reflected in the confirmation. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
Some of your shares may be registered differently or held in a different account. You should authorize a proxy to vote the shares in each of your accounts by mail, by telephone or via the Internet. If you mail proxy cards, please sign, date and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted. If you hold your shares in registered form and wish to combine your stockholder accounts in the future, you should contact Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, or call us at (866) 792-8700. Combining accounts reduces excess printing and mailing costs, resulting in cost savings to us that benefit you as a stockholder. 
What if I receive only one set of proxy materials although there are multiple stockholders at my address? 
The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of documents filed by us with the SEC, including proxy statements and annual reports. The rule allows us to, with the consent of affected stockholders, send a single set of any annual report, proxy statement, proxy statement combined with a prospectus or  TABLE OF CONTENTS
information statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they share the same last name or we reasonably believe they are members of the same family. This procedure is referred to as "Householding." This rule benefits both you and us. It reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps us reduce expenses. Each stockholder subject to Householding will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. 
We will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of our annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy was previously delivered. If you received a single set of disclosure documents for this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, you may direct requests for separate copies to Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, New Jersey 08701, or call us at (866) 792-8700. Likewise, if your household currently receives multiple copies of disclosure documents and you would like to receive one set, please contact us. 
Whom should I call for additional information about authorizing a proxy by mail, telephone or Internet to vote my shares? 
Please call CFS, our proxy solicitor, at 1-866-641-4227. 
How do I submit a stockholder proposal for next year's annual meeting or proxy materials, and what is the deadline for submitting a proposal? 
In order for a stockholder proposal to be properly submitted for presentation at our 2019 Annual Meeting, pursuant to our current bylaws we must receive written notice of the proposal at our executive offices during the period beginning on May 10, 2019, and ending at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on June 12, 2019. If you wish to present a proposal for inclusion in the proxy material for next year's annual meeting, we must receive written notice of your proposal at our executive offices no later than June 12, 2019. All proposals must contain the information specified in, and otherwise comply with, our bylaws. Proposals should be sent via registered, certified or express mail to: Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, Attention: Joseph Teichman. For additional information, see the section in this proxy statement captioned "Stockholder Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting."  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
PROPOSAL ONE:  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
General 
The Board of Directors ultimately is responsible for directing the management of our business and affairs. We have no employees and have retained the Advisor to manage our day-to-day operations, including the acquisition of our properties. The Advisor is an affiliate of our Sponsor, The Lightstone Group (the "Sponsor"). The Board of Directors, including our independent directors, is responsible for monitoring and supervising the Advisor's conduct of our day-to-day operations. 
Our bylaws provide for a Board of Directors with no fewer than three and no more than fifteen directors, a majority of whom must be independent. An "independent director" is defined under our Charter and means a person who is not, and within the last two years has not been, directly or indirectly associated with the Company, the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates by virtue of: 
 ownership of an interest in the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than the Company; 
​
 employment by the Company, the Sponsor, the Advisors or any of their affiliates; 
​
 service as an officer or director of the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than as a director of the Company; 
​
 performance of services, other than as a director of the Company; 
​
 service as a director of the Company or as a director of more than three real estate investment trusts organized by the Sponsor or advised by the Advisor; or 
​
 maintenance of a material business or professional relationship with the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates. 
​
An independent director cannot be associated with us, the Sponsor or the Advisor as set forth above either directly or indirectly. An indirect association with the Sponsor or the Advisor includes circumstances in which a director's spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law or brother- or sister-in-law, is or has been associated with us, the Sponsor, the Advisor, or any of their affiliates. 
A business or professional relationship is considered material if the aggregate gross revenue derived by the director from the Advisor or the Sponsor and their affiliates exceeds five percent of either the director's annual gross income during either of the last two years or the director's net worth on a fair market value basis. 
We currently have four directors, three of whom are independent. Directors are elected annually by our stockholders, and there is no limit on the number of times a director may be elected to office. Each director serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders or (if longer) until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. 
During 2017, the Board of Directors held ten meetings including our annual stockholders' meeting held on December 11, 2017. The entire Board of Directors was present at all of the meetings. The Board of Directors expects each director to attend annual meetings of stockholders when possible. We anticipate that all directors and nominees will attend our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Nominees for the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors has proposed the following nominees for election as directors, each to serve until our 2019 Annual Meeting of stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualifies: David W. Lichtenstein, Edwin J. Glickman and George R. Whittemore. Each nominee currently serves as a director. TABLE OF CONTENTS
The proxy holder named on the enclosed proxy card intends to vote FOR the election of each of the three nominees for director. If you do not wish your shares to be voted for particular nominees, please identify the exceptions in the designated space provided on the proxy card or, if you are authorizing a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or the Internet, follow the instructions provided when you authorize a proxy. 
We know of no reason why any nominee will be unable to serve if elected. If, at the time of the meeting, one or more of the nominees should become unable to serve, shares represented by proxies will be voted for the remaining nominees and for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board of Directors. No proxy will be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees described in this proxy statement. 
The principal occupation and certain other information about the nominees are set forth below.

Nominating the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors does not have a standing nominating committee for the purpose of nominating individuals to serve as directors. All members of our Board of Directors participate in the consideration of director nominees.

In determining the composition of the Board of Directors, our goals are to assemble a board that, as a whole, possesses the appropriate balance of professional and real estate industry knowledge, financial expertise and high-level management experience to bring a diverse set of skills and experiences to the board as a whole to oversee our business. The Board of Directors believes that diversity is an important attribute  TABLE OF CONTENTS
of the members of our Board of Directors and that the members should represent an array of backgrounds. To that end, our Board of Directors includes directors who complement and strengthen the skills of other members and who also exhibit integrity, collegiality, sound business judgment and other qualities that we view as critical to effective functioning of the board. The brief biographies in "Proposal One" include information, as of the date of this proxy, regarding the specific and particular experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each director or nominee that led the board to believe that the director should serve on the board. 
The Board of Directors annually reviews the appropriate experience, skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of our business. This review includes, in the context of the perceived needs of the board at that time, issues of knowledge, experience, judgment and skills relating to the understanding of the real estate industry, accounting or financial expertise. The Board of Directors gives consideration to the members of the Board of Directors having a diverse mix of background and skills. This review also includes the candidate's ability to attend regular board meetings and to devote a sufficient amount of time and effort in preparation for such meetings. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Ethics"), which is applicable to the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Code of Ethics covers topics including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest, confidentiality of information, full and fair disclosure, reporting of violations and compliance with laws and regulations. The Code of Ethics is available, free of charge, on our website at www.lightstonecapitalmarkets.com. You may also obtain a copy of the Code of Ethics by writing to: Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, Attention: Joseph Teichman. A waiver of the Code of Ethics for our Chief Executive Officer may be made only by the Board of Directors and will be promptly disclosed to the extent required by law. A waiver of the Code of Ethics for all other directors, officers and employees may be made only by our Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel, and shall be discussed with the Board of Directors as appropriate. 
Board Leadership Structure 
As noted above, our Board of Directors currently is comprised of three independent directors and one affiliated director. Mr. Lichtenstein has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2008 and serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Glickman, one of the independent directors, serves as the "presiding director" at any executive sessions of the independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE. The Board of Directors believes that this provides an effective leadership model for the Company. 
We recognize that different board leadership structures may be appropriate for companies in different situations, and that no one structure is suitable for all companies. We believe our current board leadership structure is optimal for us because it demonstrates to our investors and other stakeholders that the Company is under strong leadership, coordinated closely between Mr. Lichtenstein, who has over 20 years of real estate industry experience, and Mr. Glickman, who has served various public and private entities as a key executive and officer over the past 20 years. In our judgment, the Company, like many U.S. companies, has been well-served by this leadership structure. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing our risk management through our Audit Committee. Under its charter, our Audit Committee is responsible for discussing guidelines and policies governing the process by which our senior management and our relevant departments assess and manage our exposure to risk, as well as our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director Independence 
Our charter and bylaws provide for a Board of Directors with no fewer than three and no more than fifteen directors, a majority of whom must be independent. An "independent director" is defined under our Charter and means a person who is not, and within the last two years has not been, directly or indirectly associated with the Company, our Sponsor or our Advisor or any of their affiliates by virtue of: 
 ownership of an interest in our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than the Company; 
​
 employment by the Company, our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates; 
​
 service as an officer of our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than as a director of the Company; 
​
 performance of services, other than as a director of the Company; 
​
 service as a director of more than three real estate investment trusts organized or controlled by our Sponsor or advised by our Advisor; or 
​
 maintenance of a material business or professional relationship with our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates. 
​
An independent director cannot be associated with us, our Sponsor or our Advisor as set forth above either directly or indirectly. An indirect association with our Sponsor or our Advisor includes circumstances in which a director's spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law or brother- or sister-in-law, is or has been associated with us, our Sponsor, our Advisor, or any of their affiliates. 
A business or professional relationship is considered material if the aggregate gross revenue derived by the director from our Advisor or our Sponsor and their affiliates exceeds five percent of either the director's annual gross income during either of the last two years or the director's net worth on a fair market value basis. 
The Board of Directors has considered the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director in accordance with the elements of independence set forth in the listing standards of the NYSE. Based upon information solicited from each nominee, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that George R. Whittemore, Edwin J. Glickman and Dov Gertzulin have no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company) and are "independent" within the meaning of the NYSE's director independence standards and Audit Committee independence standards, as currently in effect. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation of Our Directors 
We have no standing compensation committee. Our entire Board of Directors determines matters relating to director and officer compensation. Our Board of Directors designs our director compensation with the goals of attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals to serve as independent directors and to fairly compensate them for their time and efforts. Because of our unique attributes as a REIT, service as an independent director on our Board of Directors requires broad expertise in the fields of real estate and real estate investment. 
We pay our independent directors an annual fee of  $40,000 and are responsible for reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses, as incurred. . 
Compensation of Our Executive Officers 
We currently have no employees. Our Advisor performs our day-to-day management functions. Our executive officers are all employees of the Advisor. Our executive officers do not receive compensation from us for services rendered to us. Our executive officers are all employees of our Advisor and are compensated by our Advisor. As a result, our Board of Directors has determined that it is not necessary to establish a compensation committee. In addition, we do not have, and the Board of Directors has not considered, a compensation policy or program for our executive officers, and we have not included a "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this proxy statement. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions" below for a discussion of the fees paid to and services provided by our Dealer Manager, Advisor and Property Manager. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The Board of Directors in its entirety performs the duties typically delegated to a compensation committee. There are no interlocks or insider participation as to compensation decisions required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION 
Employee and Director Incentive Restricted Share Plan 
Our employee and director incentive restricted share plan: 
 furnishes incentives to individuals chosen to receive restricted shares because they are considered capable of improving our operations and increasing profits; 
​
 encourages selected persons to accept or continue employment with our Advisor and its affiliates; and 
​
 increases the interest of our employees, officers and directors in our welfare through their participation in the growth in the value of shares of our Common Stock. 
​
Our employee and director incentive restricted share plan provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares of our Common Stock to our directors, officers and full-time employees (in the event we ever have employees), full-time employees of our Advisor and its affiliates, full-time employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain of our consultants and certain consultants to the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us. The total number of shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under this plan is equal to 0.5% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis at any time, not to exceed 255,000 shares. 
Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to shares of Common Stock from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives. Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or other relationship with us. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash dividends prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. Any dividends payable in shares of our Common Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares. 
The guidance under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code provides that there is no deferral of compensation merely because the value of property (received in connection with the performance of services) is not includible in income by reason of the property being substantially nonvested (as defined in Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code). Accordingly, it is intended that the restricted share grants will not be considered "nonqualified deferral compensation." 
We have not yet granted any awards of restricted shares. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires each director, officer and individual beneficially owning more than 10% of our Common Stock to file initial statements of beneficial ownership (Form 3) and statements of changes in beneficial ownership (Forms 4 and 5) of our Common Stock with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all such forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us during and with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, or written representations that no additional forms were required, we believe that all of our officers and directors and persons that beneficially own more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock complied with these filing requirements in 2017. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
David Lichtenstein serves as the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer and our President. Our Advisor and its affiliated property managers (the "Property Managers") are indirectly owned and controlled by subsidiaries of our Sponsor, The Lightstone Group, which is majority owned by Mr. Lichtenstein. On February 17, 2009, we entered into agreements with our Advisor and the Property Managers to pay certain fees, as described below, in exchange for services performed by these and other related party entities. As the indirect owner of those entities, Mr. Lichtenstein benefits from fees and other compensation that they receive pursuant to these agreements.
Property Manager 
Our Property Managers may manage certain of the properties we acquire. We also use other unaffiliated third-party property managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties. 
We have agreed to pay our Property Managers a monthly management fee of up to 5% of the gross revenues from our residential, lodging and retail properties. In addition, for the management and leasing of our office and industrial properties, we will pay to our Property Managers property management and leasing fees of up to 4.5% of gross revenues from our office and industrial properties. We may pay our Property Manager a separate fee for the one-time initial rent-up or leasing-up of newly constructed office and industrial properties in an amount not to exceed the fee customarily charged in arm's length transactions by others rendering similar services in the same geographic area for similar properties as determined by a survey of brokers and agents in such area. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our property managers are entitled to receive higher fees in the event our property managers demonstrate to the satisfaction of a majority of the directors (including a majority of the independent directors) that a higher competitive fee is justified for the services rendered. Our Property Manager will also be paid a monthly fee for any extra services equal to no more than that which would be payable to an unrelated party providing the services. The actual amounts of these fees are dependent upon results of operations and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time. 
We have not incurred any fees to the Property Manager for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
Advisor 
We will pay our Advisor an acquisition fee equal to 0.95% of the gross contractual purchase price (including any mortgage assumed) of each property purchased and will reimburse our Advisor for expenses that it incurs in connection with the purchase of a property. We anticipate that acquisition expenses will be 0.45% of a property's purchase price, and acquisition fees and expenses are capped at 5% of the gross contract purchase price of a property. The Advisor will also be paid an advisor asset management fee of 0.95% of our average invested assets and we will reimburse some expenses of the Advisor. Total fees paid to the Advisor for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively. 
Sponsor 
From our inception through the termination of the Follow-On Offering on September 27, 2014, Lightstone SLP II LLC, which is wholly owned by our Sponsor, contributed cash of approximately $12.9 million and equity interests totaling 48.6% in Brownmill, LLC, which were valued at $4.8 million, in exchange for 177.0 Subordinated Profits Interests with an aggregate value of  $17.7 million. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
As the sole member of our Sponsor, which wholly owns Lightstone SLP II, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect, beneficial owner of such subordinated profits interests and will thus receive an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof. 
These subordinated profits interests will entitle Lightstone SLP II, LLC to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that we make to stockholders, but only after stockholders have received a stated preferred return. Although the actual amounts are dependent upon results of operations and,  TABLE OF CONTENTS
therefore, cannot be determined at the present time, distributions to Lightstone SLP II, LLC, as holder of the subordinated profits interests, could be substantial. 
Acquisitions and Investments in Entities Affiliated with Sponsor 
Brownmill LLC
During 2010, 2011 and 2012, our Sponsor contributed to our operating partnership an approximate aggregate 48.6% equity interest (34.4%, 5.6% and 8.6% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively) in Brownmill LLC ("Brownmill") in order to fulfill its semi-annual commitment to purchase Subordinated Profits Interests with cash or contributed property. In exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 48 units (33, 6 and 9 in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively) of Subordinated Profits Interests, at $100,000 per unit (at an aggregate total value of  $4.8 million, of which $3.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million were in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively), to Lightstone SLP II LLC. Our 48.6% aggregate interest in Brownmill is a non-managing interest. An affiliate of our Sponsor is the majority owner and manager of Brownmill. Affiliates of our Sponsor own the remaining 51.4% interest in Brownmill. Profit and cash distributions are allocated in accordance with each investor's ownership percentage. We account for our on investment in Brownmill in accordance with the equity method of accounting. 
The Joint Venture 
Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. ("Lightstone I"), a related party REIT also sponsored by our Sponsor has a 2.5% membership interest in a joint venture (the "Joint Venture") with the Company. The Joint Venture previously acquired Lightstone I's membership interests in a portfolio of 11 hotels in a series of transactions completed during 2015. During the third quarter of 2017, the Joint Venture sold its ownership interests in four of the hotels to an unrelated third party. On November 6, 2017, the Joint Venture acquired a 170-room select service hotel located in New Orleans, Louisiana (the "Hyatt — New Orleans") from an unrelated third party. As a result, the Joint Venture holds ownership interests in eight hotels as of June 30, 2018. 
Notes Receivable from Related Party 
The Company had entered into various revolving promissory notes (collectively, the "Notes Receivable from Related Party") with the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. ("Lightstone III"), a REIT also sponsored by the Company's Sponsor as discussed below. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded interest income (included in interest and dividend income in the consolidated statements of operations) of  $0.6 million (including origination fees of $0.3 million) on the Notes Receivable from Related Party. 
Des Moines Note Receivable 
On February 4, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving promissory note (the "Des Moines Note Receivable") of up to $10.0 million with Lightstone III. On the same date, in connection with Lightstone III's acquisition of a Hampton Inn hotel located in Des Moines, Iowa (the "Hampton Inn — Des Moines"), the Company funded $8.2 million under the Des Moines Note Receivable. 
The Des Moines Note Receivable had a term of one year, bore interest at a floating rate of three-month Libor plus 6.0% and required quarterly interest payments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. Lightstone pledged its ownership interest in the Hampton Inn — Des Moines as collateral. The Des Moines Note Receivable had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015 and subsequently expired on February 4, 2016. 
Durham Note Receivable 
On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving promissory note (the "Durham Note Receivable") of up to $13.0 million with Lightstone III. On the same date, in connection with Lightstone III's acquisition of a Courtyard by Marriott hotel located in Durham, North Carolina (the "Courtyard — Durham"), the Company funded $12.0 million under the Durham Note Receivable.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Durham Note Receivable had a term of one year, bore interest at a floating rate of three-month Libor plus 6.0% and required quarterly interest payments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. Lightstone III pledged its ownership interest in the Courtyard — Durham as collateral. On May 2, 2016, the Durham Note Receivable was repaid in full ($10.1 million). 
Lansing Note Receivable 
On May 2, 2016, the Company entered into a revolving promissory note (the "Lansing Note Receivable") of up to $8.0 million with Lightstone III, of which $6.0 million was funded. The Lansing Note Receivable had a term of one year (with an option for an additional year), bore interest at a floating rate of three-month Libor plus 6.0% (6.65% as of June 30, 2016) and required quarterly interest payments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. Lightstone III paid the Company an origination fee of  $0.1 million in connection with the Lansing Note Receivable and pledged its ownership interest in a Hampton Inn hotel located in Lansing, Michigan as collateral. The outstanding principal balance and remaining availability under the Lansing Note Receivable were $6.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. On July 13, 2016, the Lansing Note Receivable was repaid in full and terminated. 
Green Bay Note Receivable 
On May 2, 2016, the Company entered into a revolving promissory note (the "Green Bay Note Receivable") of up to $14.5 million with Lightstone III, of which $10.2 million was funded. The Green Bay Note Receivable had a term of one year (with an option for an additional year), bore interest at a floating rate of three-month Libor plus 6.0% (6.65% as of June 30, 2016) and required quarterly interest payments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. Lightstone III paid the Company an origination fee of  $0.1 million in connection with the Green Bay Note Receivable and pledged its ownership interest in a SpringHill Suites hotel located in Green Bay, Wisconsin as collateral. The outstanding principal balance and remaining availability under the Green Bay Note Receivable were $10.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. On July 13, 2016, the Green Bay Note Receivable was repaid in full and terminated. 
Other Related Party Transactions 
From time to time, the Company purchases title insurance from an agent in which our Sponsor owns a 50% limited partnership interest. Because this title insurance agent receives significant fees for providing title insurance, our Advisor may face a conflict of interest when considering the terms of purchasing title insurance from this agent. However, prior to the purchase by the Company of any title insurance, an independent title consultant with more than 25 years of experience in the title insurance industry reviews the transaction, and performs market research and competitive analysis on our behalf. This process results in terms similar to those that would be negotiated at an arm's-length basis. The Company paid approximately $0.2 million in fees to this title insurance agent during the year ended December 31, 2017 and no amounts were paid during the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Charter generally requires that any transactions between us and our Sponsor, our Advisor, our directors, or their affiliates must be approved by a majority of our directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction. In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a policy relating to the review, approval and ratification of transactions with related persons. This policy applies to any transaction, the amount of which exceeds $120,000, between us and any person who is a director, executive officer or the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities. Any such related person transaction is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will decide whether or not to approve a related party transaction and will generally approve only those transactions that do not create a conflict of interest. The Board of Directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) has approved the transactions disclosed in this section titled "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions."

RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENTREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
EisnerAmper LLP audited our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. EisnerAmper LLP reports directly to our Audit Committee.

Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee must approve any fee for services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm in advance of the services being performed. In considering the nature of the services provided by the independent auditor, the Audit Committee determined that such services are compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services with the independent auditor and the Company's management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement the related requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
All services rendered by EisnerAmper LLP for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approved by the Audit Committee. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS' REPORT 
To the Stockholders of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc.: 
We have reviewed the Company's policies and determined that they are in the best interest of the Company's stockholders. Set forth below is a discussion of the basis for that determination. 
General
The Company's primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. The Company intends to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties.
The Company has and intends to continue to primarily acquire full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels. Even though the Company has and intends to continue primarily to acquire hotels, it has and may continue to purchase other types of real estate.
Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. The Company has and expects to invest mainly in direct real estate investments and other equity interests; however, it may also invest in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk.
The Company expects that its portfolio will provide consistent current income and may also provide capital appreciation resulting from its expectation that in certain circumstances it has or will be able to acquire properties at a discount to replacement cost or otherwise at less than what we perceive as the market value or to reposition or redevelop a property so as to increase its value over the amount of capital we deployed to acquire and rehabilitate the property. The Company has and may continue to acquire properties that it believes would benefit from a change in management strategy, or that have incurred substantial deferred maintenance. The Company has and plans to continue to diversify its portfolio by geographic region, investment size and investment risk with the goal of owning a portfolio of hotels and other income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets that provide attractive returns for its investors.
Financing Policies 
The Company has and intends to continue to utilize leverage to acquire its properties. The number of different properties the Company will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including, the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to the Company, the Company may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. There is no limitation on the amount the Company may invest in any single property or on the amount the Company can borrow for the purchase of any property.
The Company has and intends to continue to limit its aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to the Company's stockholders. The Company may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less. By operating on a leveraged basis, the Company may have more funds available for investment in properties. This may allow the Company to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a more diversified portfolio. Although the Company's liability for the repayment of indebtedness is expected to be limited to the value of the property securing the liability and the rents or profits derived therefrom, the Company's use of leveraging increases the risk of default on the mortgage payments and a resulting foreclosure of a particular property. To the extent that the Company does not obtain mortgage loans on the Company's properties, the Company's ability to acquire additional properties will be restricted. The Company will endeavor to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Policy on Sale or Disposition of Properties 
The Company's Board will determine whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of after considering the relevant factors, including performance or projected performance of the property and market conditions, with a view toward achieving its principal investment objectives.
The Company currently intends to hold its properties for a minimum of seven to ten years from the termination of the Company's initial public offering, which occurred on September 27, 2014, prior to selling them. After seven to ten years, the Company's Board may decide to liquidate the Company, list its shares on a national stock exchange, sell its properties individually or merge or otherwise consolidate the Company with a publicly-traded REIT. Alternatively, the Company may merge with, or otherwise be acquired by, the Sponsor or its affiliates. The Company may, however, sell properties prior to such time and if so, may invest the proceeds from any sale, financing, refinancing or other disposition of its properties into additional properties. Alternatively, the Company may use these proceeds to fund maintenance or repair of existing properties or to increase reserves for such purposes. The Company may choose to reinvest the proceeds from the sale, financing and refinancing of its properties to increase its real estate assets and its net income. Notwithstanding this policy, the Board, in its discretion, may distribute all or part of the proceeds from the sale, financing, refinancing or other disposition of all or any of the Company's properties to the Company's stockholders. In determining whether to distribute these proceeds to stockholders, the Board will consider, among other factors, the desirability of properties available for purchase, real estate market conditions, the likelihood of the listing of the Company's shares on a national securities exchange and compliance with the applicable requirements under federal income tax laws.
When the Company sells a property, it intends to obtain an all-cash sale price. However, the Company may take a purchase money obligation secured by a mortgage on the property as partial payment, and there are no limitations or restrictions on the Company's ability to take such purchase money obligations. The terms of payment to the Company will be affected by custom in the area in which the property being sold is located and the then prevailing economic conditions. If the Company receives notes and other property instead of cash from sales, these proceeds, other than any interest payable on these proceeds, will not be available for distributions until and to the extent the notes or other property are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed. Therefore, the distribution of the proceeds of a sale to the stockholders may be delayed until that time. In these cases, the Company will receive payments in cash and other property in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments will be spread over a number of years.
