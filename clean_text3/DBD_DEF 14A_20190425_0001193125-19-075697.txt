     PROXY SUMMARY       
[END TABLE]
KEY LEADERSHIP AND BOARD DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2018, a new Chairman of the Board, a new Chief Executive Officer and ultimately a new Chief Financial Officer significantly reset Diebold Nixdorf by launching a transformation and turnaround to reshape the Company's future. The work in 2018 included: 
At the same time, our Board of Directors continued a thorough refreshment process to align our Board with the strategic goals and challenges of the organization resulting in: 
Entering 2019, we are focused on serving our dynamic customer needs, improving operational efficiency and advancing our leadership position within the retail and banking industries. 
On January 1, 2018, Gary Greenfield assumed the position of Chairman of the Board and immediately undertook, with his fellow directors, to identify our next CEO to lead the Company forward. Mr. Greenfield also continued the board refreshment process, adding two new independent directors in 2018. Mr. Greenfield brings to the chairmanship more than 30 years of experience in corporate turnarounds and transformation, particularly focused on technology. 
The Board's CEO search process was both expeditious and impactful. In February 2018, Gerrard Schmid, a seasoned corporate executive with a track record of delivering value in a transforming environment, including as a public company CEO, joined the Company as our President and CEO. Under 
 Mr. Schmid's leadership, the Company promptly developed strategies and initiatives, including DN Now, to improve financial performance, deliver value to customers and shareholders and create growth opportunities for our employees. By the end of the year, despite unexpected challenges stemming from the Company's 2016 German acquisition, these initiatives bore significant fruit. We finished the year with fourth quarter profit and cash flow performance that was the strongest since the combination of Diebold and Wincor Nixdorf. 
In October 2018, the Company attracted an experienced interim CFO, Jeffrey Rutherford, with substantial turnaround credentials across manufacturing and technology industries. In November 2018, Mr. Rutherford hired a new head of global finance whose responsibilities include improvements to the Company's forecasting function. Mr. Rutherford was named permanent CFO on January 3, 2019. Mr. Rutherford is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the DN Now program across the Company's global finance function. 
Our DN Now transformation requires rigorous work and extensive contributions from virtually all functions of the business. Our early success is creating good energy within our leadership team and we are strengthening the team with new, experienced leaders such as Hermann Wimmer to lead retail and Julian Sparkes to transform internal IT as our Chief Digital Officer. 
In addition, the Company's transformation is taking effect in the marketplace. Key accomplishments include:

Q:  What items will be voted on at the Annual Meeting and how does the Board recommend I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You are being asked to vote on the proposals outlined above in the proxy summary on page 1. The Board recommends a vote  FOR each nominee, and FOR each of Proposals 2, 3 and 4.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What happens if other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If a permissible proposal other than the listed proposals is presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy gives authority  to the individuals named in the proxy to vote on any such proposal in accordance with their best judgment. We have not received notice of other matters that may be properly presented at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Our record date for the 2019 Annual Meeting is February 25, 2019. Each shareholder of record of our common shares as  of the close of business on February 25, 2019 is entitled to one vote for each common share held. As of the record date, there were 76,563,308 common shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote?

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I cumulate my votes for the election of directors?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  No. At the 2017 Annual Meeting, our Shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended Articles of Incorporation to  eliminate cumulative voting in director elections.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many votes are required to adopt each proposal?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  For Proposal 1, the number of votes cast "for" the director-nominee's election must exceed the number of  votes cast "against" his or her election. For each of Proposals 2, 3, and 4, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast, whether in person or by proxy, is required for approval. The results of the voting at the  meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the Majority Voting Policy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy that any director-nominee who is elected but receives a greater number of  votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" his or her election, in an election that is not a contested election, is expected to tender his or her resignation following certification of the shareholder vote, as described  in greater detail below under "Majority Voting Policy."

Q:  What is a "broker non-vote"?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, your shares may be voted even if you do not provide the brokerage  firm with voting instructions. Brokerage firms have the authority under the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, rules to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions on certain "routine" matters. When a proposal  is not a routine matter under NYSE rules and the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal. This is referred  to as a "broker non-vote."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Proposal 2, the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the  year ending December 31, 2019, is the only routine matter for which the brokerage firm who holds your shares can vote your shares on these proposals without your instructions. Accordingly, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 2. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposals 1, 3 and 4.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many shares must be present to constitute a quorum and conduct the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A quorum is necessary to hold the Annual Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares present or represented by proxy  constitutes a quorum for the purpose of adopting a proposal at the Annual Meeting. If you are present and vote in person at the Annual Meeting, or vote on the Internet, by telephone or by submitting a properly executed proxy card, you will be  considered part of the quorum. Broker non-votes will not be part of the voting power present, but will be counted to determine whether or not a quorum is present.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What happens if I abstain?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  For all proposals except Proposal 4, a share voted "abstain" with respect to any proposal is considered as   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding Internet availability  of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Under rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy  materials on the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending you a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The instructions found in the Notice explain that all shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on  www.proxyvote.com or request to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials. You may also request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. We encourage you to take advantage of the  availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting materials.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What shares are included on my proxy card or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The number of shares printed on your proxy card(s) represents all your shares under a particular registration. Receipt of  more than one proxy card or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials means that certain of your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account. If you receive more than one proxy card, sign and return all of your proxy  cards to ensure that all of your shares are voted. If you receive more than one Notice, reference the distinct 16-digit control number on each Notice when voting by Internet.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance principles and practices to ensure that the Board most effectively and efficiently serves in its oversight obligations. 
 This section provides an overview of the organization of the Board, its committees, responsibilities and other related topics and initiatives. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board is committed to strong leadership and currently maintains separate roles of our CEO, and our Chairman of the Board. We believe this structure is effective for our current circumstances and a good governance practice. The Board does not have a specific policy with respect to separating or combining these roles, or whether the Chairman should be an employee or non-employee director, and will continue to periodically review our leadership structure in light of corporate governance standards, market practices and our specific circumstances and needs. 
BOARD AND DIRECTOR ASSESSMENTS 
The Board Governance Committee leads the Board and director assessment program, as noted below in "Board Committees and Composition." When taken together, the following assessment program provides a holistic review of the role, performance and function of the full Board, the Chairman and each director in relation to the Company's needs, challenges and opportunities. Our Board and director assessments helped inform our recent refreshment efforts, including the four new nominees for director this year. The assessment program includes a full board self-assessment, committee assessments, a chairman assessment and individual director assessments. The full board self-assessment includes comprehensive questions designed to provide an all-inclusive evaluation of the performance of the Board in light of our needs and strategies. The committee, chairman, and individual director assessments are more specifically tailored. The assessment results are shared with our Chairman, and applicable directors, committee members, and the full Board as appropriate, and action plans are prepared and executed as necessary. 
BOARD MEETINGS AND EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 
The Board held five regular meetings and five special meetings in person or telephonically during 2018. All of our current directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the Board committees on which they served during 2018. 
In accordance with the NYSE's corporate governance standards, our independent directors regularly meet in executive session without management present, generally following each regularly-scheduled Board meeting. In addition, on occasion, our independent directors will meet in executive session prior to the start of a Board meeting. Gary 
 Greenfield, the Chairman of our Board, presides over these meetings in executive session. The executive sessions of each Board committee are overseen by the respective committee chair. 
While we do not have a formal policy regarding directors' attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, it is expected that all directors attend the Annual Meeting unless there are extenuating circumstances for non-attendance. All directors standing for re-election who were serving as directors as of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders attended the 2018 annual meeting. 
BOARD RISK OVERSIGHT 
The Board and the Board committees collectively play an active role in overseeing management of our risks and in helping establish an appropriate risk tolerance. The Board oversees our risk strategy and effectiveness; however, management is responsible for identifying risks inherent in our business, as well as implementing and supervising day-to-day risk management. Accordingly, the Board and the appropriate committees receive regular reports from our senior management on areas of material risk to us, including operational, financial, strategic, compliance, cybersecurity, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE       
     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE       
[END TABLE]
 competitive, reputational, legal and regulatory risks. The Board also meets with senior management as part of each Board meeting, and more frequently as needed, to discuss strategic planning, including the key risks inherent in our short- and long-term strategies. Senior management then provides the Board with periodic updates throughout the year with respect to these strategic initiatives and the impact and management of these key risks. 
In addition, each Board committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks within its area of responsibility and overseeing the management of such risks. The entire Board is then informed about such risks and management's response to each risk through regular committee reports delivered by the Committee Chairs. Our Compensation Committee performs an annual compensation risk assessment, and we believe that our compensation practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
We also have robust internal dialog among our operations, finance, compliance, treasury, tax, legal and internal audit departments, among others, whenever a potential risk arises. 
 These discussions are escalated to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, Chief People Officer, and/or Vice President, Security Office, Vice President, Internal Audit and other Vice Presidents of our various divisions and regions, as appropriate, with open lines of communication among them, the various committees of the Board and the entire Board. 
We believe that the Board's approach and continued evaluation of its risk oversight, as described above, enhances its ability to assess the various risks, make informed cost-benefit decisions, and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for the Company. We also believe that our Board leadership structure complements our risk management structure because it allows our independent directors to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls. 
BOARD COMMITTEES AND COMPOSITION 
The Board's current standing committees are the Audit Committee, Board Governance Committee, Compensation Committee, Finance Committee and Technology Strategy and Innovation Committee. Each committee's members and meetings during 2018 and functions are described below. The Board reviews committee membership, charters and responsibilities every year and will do so in 2019 following the Annual Meeting.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
The Board determined that each of Patrick W. Allender, Arthur F. Anton, Bruce H. Besanko, Reynolds C. Bish, Ellen M. Costello, Phillip R. Cox, Richard L. Crandall, Dr. Alexander Dibelius, Dr. Dieter W. Düsedau, Gale S. Fitzgerald, Matthew Goldfarb, Gary G. Greenfield, Kent M. Stahl and Alan J. Weber has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us) and is independent under our director independence standards, the NYSE director independence standards, and the SEC independence requirements, as applicable and as currently in effect. In addition, former directors Robert S. Prather, Jr., Rajesh K. Soin and Henry D. G. Wallace, also met these independence standards at the time of their service in 2018. Gerrard Schmid does not meet these independence standards because he is employed by us as our President and CEO. 
In making the independence determinations, the Board considered the following business or professional relationships and determined, in each instance, that the relationship was not material or did not impair the independence of the respective directors:

RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION POLICY 
Pursuant to our director independence standards, discussed above, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, discussed below in "Director Qualifications," we do not engage in transactions with non-employee directors or their affiliates if a transaction would cause an independent director to no longer be deemed independent, would present the appearance of a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited by law, rule or regulation. This includes, directly or indirectly, any extension, maintenance or renewal of an extension of credit to any of our directors. This prohibition also includes significant business dealings with directors or their affiliates, charitable contributions that would require disclosure in our proxy statement under the rules of the NYSE, and consulting contracts with, or other indirect forms of compensation to, a director. Any waiver of this policy may be made only by the Board and must be promptly disclosed to our shareholders. 
In 2018, we did not engage in any related person transaction(s) requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS 
The Company's Board of Directors provides a process for shareholders to send communications to the Board. Shareholders and interested parties may communicate with our Audit, Board Governance and Compensation Committee Chairs by sending an email to the address provided in the applicable committee description above or with our non-employee directors as a group by sending an email to nonmanagementdirectors@dieboldnixdorf.com. 
Communications may also be directed in writing to such person or group at Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated, Attention: 
 Corporate Secretary, 5995 Mayfair Road, P.O. Box 3077, North Canton, Ohio 44720-8077. The independent members of the Board have approved a process for handling communications we receive that are addressed to non-employee members of the Board. Under that process, the Corporate Secretary will review all such communications and determine whether communications require immediate attention. The Corporate Secretary will forward communications, or a summary of communications, to the appropriate director or directors. 
CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS 
All of our directors, executive officers and employees are required to comply with certain policies and protocols concerning business ethics and conduct as provided in our Code of Business Ethics. The Code of Business Ethics ties our core values to the ethical principles that must guide our business decisions. The Code of Business Ethics also provides clear information on the resources available for directors, executive officers and employees to ask questions and report unethical behavior. All members of the Board have received training specific to the Code of Business Ethics. 
The Code of Business Ethics applies to us, including all of our domestic and international affiliates and subsidiaries. The Code of Business Ethics describes certain responsibilities that our directors, executive officers and employees have to the Company, to each other and to our global partners and communities. It covers many topics, including compliance with laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and relevant global anti-corruption laws, conflicts of interest, intellectual property and the protection of competitive and confidential information, as well as maintaining a respectful and non-retaliatory workplace. The Code of Business Ethics also includes and links to our Conflicts of Interest Policy, which further details the requirements for our officers, directors and employees to avoid and disclose potential conflicts, including those that may result from related party transactions. In addition, our employees are required to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be a violation of the Code of Business Ethics. Our Audit Committee has procedures to receive, retain and treat complaints regarding accounting, internal financial controls or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable practices or potential violations of our policies, including the Code of Business Ethics. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
The members of the Compensation Committee during the year ended December 31, 2018 were Phillip R. Cox, Dr. Alexander Dibelius, Dr. Dieter W. Düsedau, Gale S. Fitzgerald, Rajesh K. Soin, and Alan J. Weber. No member of the Compensation Committee has had any relationships requiring disclosure by us under the SEC's rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related person transactions. No officer or employee of the Company has served as a director or member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, the executive officers of which served as a director of the Company or member of the Compensation Committee during 2018. 
DIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND EDUCATION 
All new directors participate in a director orientation program. The Board Governance Committee oversees this introduction and orientation process during which the new director meets with key senior management personnel and takes a tour through our global solutions center to improve his or her understanding of our business and global products and solutions. In addition, the orientation process educates the new director on his or her obligations as a director, the history of the Company, our strategic plans, significant financial matters, core values, including ethics and compliance programs (and also including our Code of Business Ethics), corporate governance practices and other key policies and practices. 
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
The following director compensation is determined by the Board at the recommendation of the Board Governance Committee. With respect to non-employee directors, it is our goal to provide directors with fair and competitive compensation, while ensuring that their compensation is closely aligned with shareholder interests. 
The annual retainer received by our non-employee directors during 2018 remained the same as that paid in 2017. Accordingly, during 2018, our non-employee directors received an annual cash retainer of $75,000 for their service as directors. Our non-executive Chairman of the Board received an additional annual cash retainer of $100,000. 
In addition to their annual cash retainers, each non-employee director may receive equity awards under our Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated 2017 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (as amended), which we refer to as the 2017 Plan. We aim to provide a balanced mix of cash and equity compensation to our directors that targets the directors' total pay at the median of a peer group of companies in similar industries and of comparable size and revenue. This peer group is the same one used by our Compensation Committee for benchmarking executive compensation, which is discussed in more detail below in "Role of Peer Companies and Competitive Market Data" under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." As such, in 2018, the Company awarded RSUs to each non-employee director which approximated $158,323 in value at the time of grant, except for Mr. Besanko who joined our Board in September and therefore received an RSU grant on a pro-rated basis to reflect partial year service. Each award provides for dividend equivalent payments in cash during the restricted period. We believe these awards strengthen the directors' ties to shareholder interests by aligning their long-term economic interests and that these awards provide effective ways to help our directors build stock ownership. 
Our non-employee directors also received the following annual committee fees for their participation as members or as Chairs of one or more Board committees:

The varying fee amounts are intended to reflect differing levels of responsibility and meeting requirements. The fees for a director who joins or leaves the Board or assumes additional responsibilities during the year are pro-rated for his or her period of actual service. A director may elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of his or her compensation pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan No. 2 for Directors.

DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
The Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines to align with the practices of our peer group (discussed further below under "Role of Peer Companies and Competitive Market Data" under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"). Each non-employee director is expected to own common shares of the Company valued at least five times the annual retainer, and the directors are not permitted to sell any vested shares prior to meeting this ownership level. We count the deferred shares held by the directors for purposes of these guidelines, which are intended to build stock ownership among non-employee directors and ensure that their long-term economic interests are aligned with those of other shareholders. In 2017, the majority of our directors exceeded these ownership guidelines, or were on track to achieve the ownership guidelines within the next few years. However, as a result of the recent decline in our stock price in 2018, our directors did not meet their ownership requirements as of December 31, 2018. 
IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING 
DIRECTOR-NOMINEES 
We are pleased to include four new nominees for director this year: Arthur F. Anton, Reynolds C. Bish, Matthew Goldfarb and Kent M. Stahl. These new director nominees, together with Ms. Costello and Mr. Besanko, who joined our Board during the course of this past year, reflect the ongoing efforts by our Board Governance Committee to identify talented nominees and directors that bring skills and strategic vision to the Company. We have also engaged with shareholders, including GAMCO, for their input and views regarding our Board succession planning. 
The Board has determined to increase the size of our Board to thirteen members effective as of the date of the Annual Meeting. The Board views this number of directors as the correct balance of new perspectives with the experience and historical knowledge of the Company and its markets held by our continuing directors. The Board Governance Committee and Board have determined that this is the appropriate size for our Board as we continue our director succession planning efforts, focusing on bringing the skills necessary to support our strategic initiatives and considering the overall diversity of our Board. The Board Governance Committee will continue to evaluate the Board size commensurate with evolving needs of the Company. 
Richard L. Crandall and Gale S. Fitzgerald are retiring from our Board at the Annual Meeting after 23 and 20 years, respectively, of service to the Company. We thank Mr. Crandall and Ms. Fitzgerald for their service to the Company. 
Although Mr. Allender has reached the retirement age set forth in our Board governance policy, the Board Governance Committee and the Board determined that a waiver of the policy was warranted in order to maintain continuity on the Board in light of the recent refreshment efforts, particularly in light of Mr. Allender's financial expertise and extensive knowledge of the Company's finances and accounting. 
IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF DIRECTOR-NOMINEES 
The Board Governance Committee considers many methods for identifying and evaluating director-nominees, plans for any anticipated vacancies and also regularly reviews the appropriate size of the Board. When vacancies arise or are anticipated, the Board Governance Committee considers various potential candidates. Candidates may come to the attention of the Board Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, shareholders or other persons. This past year, the Company engaged a third-
 party search firm, Korn Ferry, to assist the Board Governance Committee in identifying, evaluating and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. As described below, the Board Governance Committee also considers properly submitted shareholder nominations for candidates for the Board. Following verification of the recommending shareholder's status, recommendations are considered by the Board Governance Committee at a regularly scheduled meeting. 
In evaluating director-nominees, including the re-election of continuing directors, the Board Governance Committee considers many factors in order to maintain and strengthen the talent and capabilities of the Board and the committees, consistent with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and other criteria established by the Board. While the Board Governance Committee does not have a formal diversity policy, its general goal is to create a well-balanced Board that combines broad business and industry experience with comprehensive diversity characteristics and professional viewpoints. Together, these considerations enable us to appropriately pursue our strategic objectives domestically and abroad. 
Of particular interest in our current search were individuals with experience as executives responsible for technology operations in companies undergoing transformation with a digital emphasis, focusing on individuals with experience in industries which have gone through technology-driven business model change, conversions from non-cloud to cloud based technology and industrial companies transforming to digital. As we continue to substantially evolve the Company, the Board also looked for candidates with deep shareholder rights experience as we evolve our business models and capital structure. 
Qualifications for Board service have not otherwise been reduced to a checklist of specific standards or minimum qualifications, skills or qualities. Rather, the Board Governance Committee decides which nominees to recommend based on the facts and circumstances at the time. Applicable considerations for new nominees or for directors potentially standing for re-election include:

       by contributing a variety of experiences, backgrounds, qualifications, technical expertise and other characteristics; and  
[END TABLE]
Final approval of any candidate is determined by the full Board. In addition, the performance and contributions of each incumbent director are assessed as part of the Board's annual assessment program, as discussed above in "Board and Director Assessments." The Board Governance Committee believes that each of the director-nominees fits the general qualifications described above and brings valuable experience, skills and qualifications to the Board. Detailed information about each director nominee's background, experience and qualifications is provided in Proposal 1: Election of Directors. 
SHAREHOLDER NOMINEES 
POLICY & PROCEDURE 
The policy of the Board Governance Committee is to consider properly submitted shareholder nominations for candidates for membership on the Board as described above under "Identification and Evaluation Methods." In evaluating shareholder nominations, the Board Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and to address the membership criteria set forth above under "Director Qualifications." 
The Board Governance Committee will consider any shareholder nominations for director that are properly proposed and meet the requirements set out in our Code of Regulations, which include but are not limited to: 
Shareholder nominations should be addressed to Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 5995 Mayfair Road, P.O. Box 3077, North Canton, Ohio 44720-8077. For important additional information related to proposal requirements, see "Shareholder Proposals" below. 
PROXY ACCESS 
We have a proxy access provision as part of our Code of Regulations, which allows a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders in aggregate, owning 3% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the number of directors in office or two nominees, whichever is greater, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our Code of Regulations. 
NOMINATION AGREEMENT WITH GAMCO 
We recently entered into a Nomination and Standstill Agreement with GAMCO Asset Management Inc. and its affiliates pursuant to which Arthur F. Anton and Matthew Goldfarb are each nominated for election at the Annual Meeting. Both Messrs. Anton and Goldfarb bring extensive experience and valuable perspectives to our Board. For additional information regarding the Nomination and Standstill Agreement, see our current report on Form 8-K filed on February 25, 2019, and for detailed information about each director nominee's background, experience and qualifications, see Proposal 1: Election of Directors below.

MAJORITY VOTING POLICY 
In light of our shareholders' approval of the amendment to the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation to implement a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, the Board adopted an amended majority voting policy, which provides that, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" election, which we refer to as a Majority Vote Against, is expected to tender his or her resignation following certification of the shareholder vote. The Board Governance Committee will then consider the tendered resignation and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. The Board will act on the Board Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this policy will not participate in the 
 Board Governance Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. 
However, if each member of the Board Governance Committee received a Majority Vote Against in the same election, then the Board will appoint a committee comprised solely of independent directors who did not receive a Majority Vote Against at that election to consider each tendered resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject each resignation. Further, if all of the directors received a Majority Vote Against in the same election, then the Board will appoint a committee comprised solely of independent directors to consider each tendered resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject each resignation. 
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION

    ✓        FOR the election of each of our director nominees   
    ✓        FOR the election of each of our director nominees   
    ✓        FOR the election of each of our director nominees   
[END TABLE]
The Board recommends that its thirteen nominees for director be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting, each to hold office for a term of one year from the date of the Annual Meeting or until the election and qualification of a successor. In the absence of contrary instruction, the Proxy Committee will vote the proxies for the election of the thirteen nominees. In connection with this proposal, the size of the Board will be increased to thirteen members, effective as of the date of the Annual Meeting. 
In connection with our board succession efforts, we are pleased to be nominating four new directors, including two nominated by shareholders, and nine continuing directors (seven of whom were previously elected by our shareholders at our 2018 annual meeting). All of the director-nominees, except for Gerrard Schmid, our President and CEO, are independent as defined by the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. 
If for any reason any director-nominee is not available for election when the election occurs, the Proxy Committee, at its option, may vote for substitute nominees recommended by the Board. Alternatively, the Board may reduce the number of director-nominees. The Board has no reason to believe that any director-nominee will be unavailable for election when the election occurs.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common shares, to file with the SEC reports of ownership of our securities on Form 3 and changes in reported ownership on Form 4 or Form 5, as applicable. Such directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely upon a review of the reports furnished to us, or written representations from reporting persons that all other reportable transactions were reported, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2018, our directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders timely filed all reports they were required to file under Section 16(a), with the exception of four Form 4s that were unintentionally filed late on behalf of: (1) our former CEO and President Mr. Andreas W. Mattes in February 2018 for the disposition of 2,512 of our common shares; (2) our director Mr. Besanko in October 2018 for the acquisition of 5,792 RSUs; (3) our director Dr. Dibelius in February 2019 for the withholding of 1,550 RSUs for tax purposes; and (4) our director Dr. Düsedau in February 2019 for the withholding of 1,550 RSUs for tax purposes.

POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to Patrick W. Allender, Chair of the Audit Committee, when expedition of services is necessary, provided that Mr. Allender must report any decisions to pre-approve to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the fees included under the categories "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. None of these fees were approved by the Audit Committee after services were rendered pursuant to the de minimis exception established by the SEC.

[END TABLE]
In this Proposal 3, as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and pursuant to Rule 14a-21(a) promulgated thereunder, we are providing our shareholders the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation Matters" that follow the proposals, pursuant to the compensation rules of the SEC. While this vote is advisory, and thus not binding on us, the Board values the opinions of our shareholders and the Compensation Committee will review the results of the vote and expects to take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding named executive officer compensation. Under current Board policy, the shareholder vote for advisory approval of named executive officer compensation will occur annually. After the 2019 Annual Meeting, the next such vote will occur at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
The "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation Matters" sections of this Proxy Statement describe our executive compensation program and the decisions and rationale of our Compensation Committee. Our executive pay program is designed to enable us to attract, retain and motivate high quality executives who will provide us with dynamic leadership and are instrumental to our success. We emphasize performance-based variable pay through a mix of base salary, annual cash bonuses and long-term incentives and seek to provide total pay that is commensurate with our performance and competitive with our peer group. Accordingly, we are asking our shareholders to vote FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement, is hereby APPROVED."

    ✓        FOR Proposal 4   
[END TABLE]
We are asking our shareholders to approve an amendment to our 2017 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended (which we refer to as the 2017 Plan). The amendment was adopted by our Board on March 13, 2019 based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee and subject to the approval of our shareholders at the Annual Meeting. If approved by our shareholders, the amendment would authorize an additional 3,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.25 par value per share, of the Company (which we refer to in this Proposal 4 as common shares) for issuance under the 2017 Plan effective April 25, 2019. The amendment would not make any other changes to the 2017 Plan. 
The 2017 Plan serves as a critical component of the overall compensation package that we offer our employees and non-employee Board members. Increasing the number of shares issuable under the 2017 Plan is necessary in order to allow us to continue to utilize equity awards to retain and attract the services of key individuals essential to our long-term growth and financial success and to further align their interests with those of our shareholders. We rely on equity awards to incentivize current and potential employees and non-employee Board members and believe that such awards are necessary for us to remain competitive in retaining and attracting highly qualified individuals upon whom, in large measure, our future growth and success depend. 
Declines in our stock price in 2018, which led to a more rapid depletion of shares available under the 2017 Plan than anticipated, have caused us to implement certain cash-based incentive compensation structures this past year in order to appropriately compensate key employees. If this Proposal 4 is not approved, we anticipate that we will not be able to provide equity-based compensation to our employees and non-employee Directors in accordance with our current compensation structure and as is customary for public companies. Furthermore, we do not believe that cash-based incentives have the same long-term retention value or serve to align employees' interests with those of our shareholders as well as a program that includes an appropriate mix of equity incentives. 
SHARE REQUEST BACKGROUND 
Our shareholders originally approved the 2017 Plan at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders; at that time, the 2017 Plan initially authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 4,941,117 common shares under the plan. At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved certain amendments to the 2017 Plan, including the authorization of an additional 1,150,000 common shares for issuance under the 2017 Plan and certain adjustments to reflect tax law changes. As of February 25, 2019, 1,264,104 common shares remain available for grants under the 2017 Plan. With the proposed 3,000,000 share increase, 4,264,104 will be available for issuance under the 2017 Plan, which represents approximately 5.6% of our 76,563,308 shares outstanding as of February 25, 2019. Absent an increase in the number of authorized shares under the 2017 Plan, we do not expect to have sufficient shares to meet our anticipated equity compensation needs for the next year. Therefore, if Proposal 4 is not approved by our shareholders, we believe our ability to attract, motivate and retain the talent we need to compete in our industry would be seriously and negatively impacted and this could affect our long-term success. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of our common shares represented and voting at the Annual Meeting is required to approve the amendment to the 2017 Plan. Our executive officers and non-employee directors have an interest in this proposal by virtue of their being eligible to receive equity awards under the 2017 Plan. 
The material features and provisions of the 2017 Plan are summarized below. The full text of the 2017 Plan, as proposed to be amended to reflect the change described above, is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The following description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to that exhibit.

        PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE DIEBOLD NIXDORF,   INCORPORATED 2017 EQUITY AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN   
[END TABLE]
2017 PLAN HIGHLIGHTS 
The 2017 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (tandem and free-standing), restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance-based shares, performance units, dividend equivalents and other share-based awards for the purpose of providing our non-employee directors, officers and other employees (and those of our subsidiaries) with incentives and rewards for performance. 
We believe our future success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate and retain high quality employees and non-employee directors and that the ability to provide equity-based and incentive-based awards under the 2017 Plan is critical to achieving this success. We would be at a severe competitive disadvantage if we could no longer use share-based awards to recruit and compensate our non-employee directors, officers and other employees. 
As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section, the use of our common shares as part of our compensation program fosters a pay-for-performance culture that is an important element of our overall compensation philosophy. We believe that equity compensation motivates non-employee directors and employees to create shareholder value because the value they realize from their equity compensation is based on our stock price performance. Equity compensation also aligns the compensation interests of our non-employee directors and employees with the investment interests of our shareholders and promotes a focus on long-term value creation because our equity compensation awards can be subject to vesting and/or performance criteria. As of February 25, 2019, approximately 1,000 of our regular, full-time employees held outstanding equity awards. 
Some of the key features of the 2017 Plan that reflect our commitment to effective management of equity and incentive compensation and our maintenance of sound governance practices in granting awards include: 
Performance-Based Awards: The 2017 Plan provides that the payment of dividend equivalents with respect to performance-
 based awards will be deferred until and paid contingent upon the level of achievement of the applicable management performance goals. 
Detrimental Activity and Clawback: The 2017 Plan contains provisions that subject all awards under it to the terms of any recoupment or clawback policy required by law or applicable stock exchange requirement or adopted and in effect at the Company. The 2017 Plan also provides that in the event a participant participates in detrimental activity, as defined in the 2017 Plan, we have the right to have awarded shares returned. 
Minimum Vesting Period: The 2017 Plan requires that nearly all awards granted under it be subject to a one-year minimum vesting period. 
No Discounted Options or Stock Appreciation Rights: The 2017 Plan prohibits the grant of options or stock appreciation rights with an exercise price less than the fair market value of our common shares on the grant date. 
No Repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights: The 2017 Plan generally prohibits the repricing of options or stock appreciation rights (outside of certain corporate transactions or adjustment events described in the 2017 Plan) without shareholder approval. 
Change in Control Definition: In 2015, we revised and conformed the definition that we use for "change in control" across our executive change in control agreements. The 2017 Plan includes this definition of "change in control" so that our agreements and this 2017 Plan provide for consistency and uniformity in the event of a change in control. 
Independent Committee Administration: Awards to our named executive officers under the 2017 Plan will be granted by a committee composed entirely of independent directors. 
Term of the 2017 Plan: No awards may be granted under the 2017 Plan more than ten years from the date of initial shareholder approval of the plan. 
SHARE USAGE 
We are committed to sound equity compensation practices because we recognize that equity compensation awards dilute shareholder equity. Our equity compensation practices are intended to be competitive and consistent with market practices, and we believe our historical share usage has been responsible and mindful of shareholder interests. For purposes of evaluating our equity compensation program, shareholders may wish to consider two metrics: historical burn rate and overhang.

More detail regarding the overhang and dilution associated with the current 2017 Plan, the 2017 Plan as proposed to be amended and our 1991 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended (which we refer to as the 1991 Plan) is below. The information is as of February 25, 2019. As of that date, there were 76,563,308 of our common shares outstanding. We replaced the 1991 Plan with the 2017 Plan at the 2017 annual meeting. No additional awards will be made under the 1991 Plan, and therefore the table below reflects that no shares are available for future issuance under the 1991 Plan. The 2017 Plan is the sole compensation plan under which future awards can be made.

Based on the closing price on the NYSE for our common shares on February 25, 2019, of $8.41 per share, the aggregate market value as of that date of the 3,000,000 additional common shares requested for issuance under the amended 2017 Plan was $25,230,000. 
In 2015, 2016 and 2017, we granted awards (including performance-based awards) under the 1991 Plan covering 1,563,000 shares, 1,717,000 shares, and 3,091,225 shares, respectively. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, we also granted awards (including performance-based awards) covering 134,869 shares, 2,806,998 shares and 2,336,101 shares, respectively, under the 2017 Plan. For information with respect to awards granted under the 2017 Plan, see "Existing Plan Benefits to Named Executive Officers and Others" below. 
In determining the number of shares to request for approval by our shareholders pursuant to the amendment, our management team worked with advisors and the Compensation Committee to evaluate a number of factors including our recent share usage and criteria expected to be utilized by institutional proxy advisory firms in evaluating this proposal. We are also mindful of the ratio of our stock-based compensation to our performance over time. 
If the amendment to the 2017 Plan is approved, we intend to utilize the increased amount of shares authorized under the 2017 Plan to continue our practice of incentivizing key individuals through annual equity grants. As noted in "2017 Plan Highlights" and elsewhere below, our Compensation Committee retains full discretion under the 2017 Plan to determine the number and amount of awards to be granted under the 2017 Plan, subject to the terms of the 2017 Plan, and future benefits that may be received by participants under the 2017 Plan are not determinable at this time. 
SUMMARY OF MATERIAL TERMS OF THE 2017 PLAN 
Shares Available Under the 2017 Plan: Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2017 Plan and the approval of Proposal 4 by shareholders at the Annual Meeting, the number of common shares that may be issued or transferred: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE DIEBOLD NIXDORF,   INCORPORATED 2017 EQUITY AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN

[END TABLE]
will not exceed in the aggregate 9,091,117 shares. Such shares may be shares of original issuance or treasury shares or a combination of the foregoing. 
If an award is canceled, expires, lapses or is forfeited or is settled in cash, the common shares underlying the award will be available for future grant. Common shares covered by an award are not counted as used unless and until they are issued or transferred. In the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from an award other than an option or stock appreciation right are satisfied by the tendering of common shares or by the withholding of common shares by us, the common shares so tendered or withheld shall be added to the common shares available for awards under the 2017 Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the following will not again become available for issuance under the 2017 Plan: (i) any common shares withheld in respect of taxes upon settlement of an option or stock appreciation right, (ii) any common shares tendered or withheld to pay an exercise price, (iii) any common shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with its stock settlement on exercise thereof, and (iv) any common shares reacquired by us on the open market or otherwise using cash proceeds. 
Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the 2017 Plan will be in effect until all shares subject to it have been purchased or acquired. In no event will any award under the 2017 Plan be granted on or after the tenth anniversary of its effective date. 
Limits on Awards: Assuming adoption of Proposal 4, the following limits apply to awards under the 2017 Plan (subject to limited permitted adjustment under the 2017 Plan): 
Minimum Vesting Requirement: The Compensation Committee shall not award more than 5% of the aggregate number of common shares that become available for grant under the 2017 Plan pursuant to awards that are solely subject to a vesting or performance condition that provides for full vesting or completion of the performance period in less than one year following the grant date of the applicable award subject, in each case, to the Compensation Committee's authority under the 2017 Plan to vest awards earlier, as the Committee deems appropriate, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2017 Plan), in the event of a participant's termination of employment or service or otherwise as permitted by the 2017 Plan. 
Eligibility: Our officers and employees (and those of our subsidiaries) (approximately 23,000 people) and our non-employee directors (currently 10 people) may be selected by the Compensation Committee to receive benefits under the 2017 Plan. We refer to those individuals selected as "participants." The basis for participation in the 2017 Plan is selection for participation by the Compensation Committee (or its proper delegate) in its discretion. 
Options: An option entitles the participant to purchase a common share at the exercise price. The Compensation Committee may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or a combination of both, but incentive stock options cannot be granted to non-employees. Dividends or dividend equivalents are not payable on options. Each option will be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the number of common shares covered by the option, the exercise price and term of the option, any conditions to the exercise and any other terms and conditions that the Compensation Committee specifies and are consistent with the 2017 Plan. The exercise price for an option will not be less than 100% of the common shares' fair market value on the date of grant (or, in the case of a 10% shareholder, 110% of the shares' fair market value on the date of grant). The exercise price is payable in cash, check, common shares, consideration received under a broker-assisted cashless exercise program, by net exercise or any other combination or method of payment to the extent permitted by law and approved by the Compensation Committee. No option will be exercisable more than 10 years from the date of grant. 
Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs): A SAR is the right to the equivalent of the increase in value of a specified number of our common shares over a specified period of time. The Compensation Committee may grant SARs alone (which we refer to as a free standing right) or in tandem with an option granted under the 2017 Plan (which we refer to as a related right). Dividends or dividend equivalents are not payable on SARs. Each SAR will be evidenced by an award agreement that describes the SAR, the exercise price and term of the SAR, any conditions to the exercise, any related option and any other terms and conditions that the Compensation Committee specifies and are consistent with the 2017 Plan. The exercise price for a SAR will not be less than 100% of the common shares' fair market value on the date of grant (or, in the case of a related right, the same exercise price as the related option). The exercise price is payable in cash, check, common shares, consideration received under a broker-assisted cashless exercise program, by net exercise or any other combination or method of payment to the extent permitted by law and approved by the Compensation Committee. The amount payable by us upon exercise of a SAR shall be paid in cash, common shares or a combination of both, and the award agreement may so specify or grant to the participant or retain

 to the Compensation Committee the right to elect among those alternatives. No SAR will be exercisable more than 10 years from the date of grant. 
Restricted Shares: Restricted shares are common shares that are subject to forfeiture and may not be transferred by a participant until the restrictions established by the Compensation Committee have lapsed. Those restrictions may take the form of a period of continued employment, board service or achievement of certain performance criteria, for example. The award agreement for each grant of restricted shares will specify the restrictions, the number of restricted shares and any other terms and conditions the Compensation Committee specifies and are consistent with the 2017 Plan. The grant will constitute a transfer of ownership and, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, will entitle the participant to voting, dividend and other ownership rights during the restriction period. 
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): An RSU is an award that is valued by reference to one common share. Payment of the value of the RSU will not be made until the restrictions established by the Compensation Committee have lapsed. Those restrictions may take the form of a period of continued employment, board service or achievement of certain performance criteria, for example. The award agreement for each RSU grant will specify the restrictions, the number of RSUs and any other terms and conditions the Compensation Committee specifies and are consistent with the 2017 Plan. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, RSUs may be credited with dividend equivalents, provided that, with respect to RSUs that are subject to performance conditions, the dividend equivalents will be deferred and paid contingent on the level of performance achieved at the end of the performance period. The amount payable may be paid in cash, common shares or a combination of both, and the award agreement may so specify or grant to the participant or retain to the Compensation Committee the right to elect among those alternatives. 
Performance Shares and Performance Units: Performance shares are shares that become payable upon the achievement of specified performance goals, which may include management goals. Performance units are valued by reference to $1.25 per unit and payable upon achievement of specified performance goals, which may include management goals. The grant may specify a minimum level of achievement of the performance or management goals and will include a formula for determining the number of shares or units earned at the end of the performance period. The Compensation Committee will certify achievement levels of performance prior to the payment of any shares or units. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, performance shares or performance units may be credited with dividend equivalents, and in all cases, the dividend equivalents will be deferred and paid contingent on the level of performance achieved at the end of the performance period. Each performance share or performance unit award will be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the number of performance shares or performance units, the performance objectives (which may include management goals), the performance period applicable to the award, and any other terms and conditions that the Compensation Committee specifies and are consistent with the 2017 Plan. The amount payable may be paid in cash, common shares or a combination of both, and the award agreement may so specify or grant to the participant or retain to the Compensation Committee the right to elect among those alternatives. 
Other Share-Based Awards: The Compensation Committee may, from time to time, grant other share-based awards not otherwise described above but in all cases consistent with the terms and conditions of the 2017 Plan. Each such award will be expressed in terms of common shares or units based on common shares and will be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the number of common shares or units granted, any conditions related to the award, and any other terms and conditions that the Compensation Committee specifies and are consistent with the 2017 Plan. The amount payable may be paid in cash, common shares or a combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Management Objectives and Goals: The 2017 Plan requires that the Compensation Committee use "Management Objectives" for purposes of establishing "Management Goals" for a performance period for any performance-based award. Management objectives that will be used to establish management goals will be based on the attainment of specific levels of performance of the Company, a subsidiary, division, business unit, operational unit, department, region or function with the Company or subsidiary in which the participant is employed. The management objectives may also be used to establish management goals on an absolute or comparative basis with other companies or a published index, as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. 
The Compensation Committee will use the management objectives to set management goals for a set performance period. The Compensation Committee may provide that an evaluation of the management goals shall include or exclude any of the following items: (1) asset write-downs; (2) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (3) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles, regulations, or other laws or regulations affecting reported results; (4) any reorganization and restructuring programs; (5) acquisitions or divestitures; (6) unusual nonrecurring or extraordinary items identified in our audited financial statements, including footnotes or in management's discussion and analysis in our annual report;

[END TABLE]
 (7) foreign exchange gains and losses; (8) changes in our fiscal year; and (9) any other specific unusual or nonrecurring events, or objectively determinable category thereof. 
Generally, if the Compensation Committee determines that a change in our business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure, or the manner in which we conduct our business, or other events or circumstances render the management goals unsuitable, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion modify such management goals or the minimum acceptable level of achievement, in whole or in part, as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate and equitable. 
Administration: The Board delegates authority to administer the 2017 Plan to the Compensation Committee or any other committee so designated by the Board. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Compensation Committee will consist of two or more non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee may further delegate its authority to make awards under the 2017 Plan, complying in the Board's discretion with the requirements of Rule 16b-3. 
The Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret the 2017 Plan and related agreements and other documents. The Compensation Committee may provide for special terms for awards to participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by us or any of our subsidiaries outside of the United States of America as the Compensation Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom, in all cases consistent with the terms of the 2017 Plan. 
Transferability: Except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, no option, SAR or other derivative security is transferable by a participant except, upon death, by will or the laws of descent and distribution. If, however, a participant is not a director or officer of ours, transfer may be made to a fully revocable trust of which the participant is treated as the owner for federal income tax purposes. Except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, options and SARs are exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by him or her or by his or her guardian or legal representative. The Compensation Committee may provide for transferability of options and SARs under the 2017 Plan if such provision would not disqualify the exemption for other awards under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and so long as such transfer is not to any third-party entity, including financial institutions. 
The Compensation Committee may specify at the date of grant that part or all of the common shares that are (i) to be issued or transferred by us upon exercise of options or SARs or upon payment under any grant of performance shares, performance units, RSUs or other share-based awards or (ii) no longer subject to the substantial risk of forfeiture and restrictions on transfer for restricted shares, shall be subject to further restrictions on transfer. 
Adjustments: The maximum number of shares that may be issued and delivered under the 2017 Plan, the number of shares covered by outstanding awards under the 2017 Plan, and the prices per share applicable to outstanding options and SARs, are subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, combinations of shares, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, liquidations, issuances of rights or warrants, and similar events. In the event of any such transaction or event, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding awards under the 2017 Plan such alternative consideration as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require the surrender of all awards so replaced. The Compensation Committee may also make or provide for such adjustments in the numbers of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan as the Compensation Committee may determine appropriate to reflect any transaction or event described above. 
Change in Control: Under the 2017 Plan, a "Change in Control" generally means the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) when any person, entity or group acquires beneficial ownership of 30% or more of our outstanding common shares or voting power of our stock entitled to vote to elect directors, subject to limited exceptions described in the 2017 Plan; (2) a turnover of a majority of the incumbent Board members as of the date of the 2017 Plan, subject to limited exceptions described in the 2017 Plan; (3) consummation of certain corporate transactions or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, subject to limited exceptions described in the 2017 Plan; or (4) when our shareholders approve a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
Tax Withholding: To the extent that we are required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any payment made or benefit realized by a participant or other person under the 2017 Plan, and the amounts available to us for such withholding are insufficient, it will be a condition to the receipt of such payment or the realization of such benefit that the participant or such other person make arrangements satisfactory to us for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld, which arrangements (in the discretion of the Compensation Committee) may include relinquishment of a portion of such benefit. Participants must also make such arrangements as we may require for the payment of any withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with the disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of option rights. In no event, however, may we accept common shares

 for the payment of taxes in excess of required tax withholding rates. However, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, a participant or such other person may surrender common shares owned for more than six months to satisfy any tax obligations resulting from any such transaction. 
Detrimental Activity: Any award agreement may provide that if a participant, either during employment by us or any of our subsidiaries or within a specified period after termination of such employment, engages in any "Detrimental Activity" (as defined in the 2017 Plan), and the Compensation Committee so finds, upon notice of such finding, the participant must unless otherwise provided in the award agreement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(A)  Return to us, in exchange for payment by us of any amount actually paid therefor by the participant, all common shares  that the participant has not disposed of that were offered pursuant to the 2017 Plan within a specified period prior to the date of the commencement of such detrimental activity, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(B)  With respect to any common shares so acquired that the participant has disposed of, pay to us in cash the difference  between:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  The market value per share of the common shares on the date of such acquisition.  
[END TABLE]
To the extent that such amounts are not paid to us, we may set off the amounts so payable to us against any amounts (but only to the extent that such amount would not be considered "non-qualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Code) that may be owing from time to time by us or one of our subsidiaries to the participant, whether as wages, deferred compensation or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason. 
Clawback: Any award under the 2017 Plan that is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy adopted by us pursuant to those requirements or pursuant to direction of the Board, including our current clawback policy) will be subject to clawback and deduction as required or permitted by law, regulation, listing requirement or policy. 
No Repricing Without Shareholder Approval: Subject to certain tax-related exceptions described in the 2017 Plan, in the case of termination of employment by reason of death, disability or normal or early retirement, or in the case of hardship or other special circumstances, of a participant who holds awards that are unearned, unvested or unexercisable, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time at which such awards are earned, vest or become exercisable. However, except in connection with a corporate transaction or event as described above with respect to adjustments, the terms of outstanding awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding options or SARs, or cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for cash, other awards or options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original option or SAR, without shareholder approval. 
Amendment and Termination: We may, by action of the Board, amend or terminate the 2017 Plan. Any amendment which must be approved by our shareholders in order to comply with applicable law or the national securities exchange upon which our common shares are traded will not be effective until such approval is obtained. Any amendment or termination of the 2017 Plan will not impair in any material way the rights and obligations of the participants under any award that is outstanding without the written consent of the participant. 
Governing Law: The 2017 Plan and all awards granted and actions taken thereunder will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio. 
New Plan Benefits: It is not possible to determine specific amounts that may be awarded in the future under the 2017 Plan because grants of awards under the 2017 Plan are discretionary. 
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO PARTICIPANTS 
The following is a brief summary of some of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of certain awards under the 2017 Plan based on U.S. federal income tax laws in effect for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2019. This summary, which is presented for the information of shareholders considering how to vote on this Proposal 4 and not for 2017 Plan participants, is not intended to be complete and does not describe federal taxes other than income taxes (such as Medicare and Social Security taxes, and Code Section 409A taxes), state, local or foreign tax consequences. 
Non-qualified Stock Options: In general, (i) no income will be recognized by a participant at the time a non-qualified option right is granted; (ii) at the time of exercise of a non-qualified option right, ordinary income will be recognized by the optionee in an amount equal to the difference between the option price paid for the shares and the fair market value of the shares, if unrestricted, on the date of exercise; and (iii) at the time of sale of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a non-qualified option right, appreciation (or depreciation) in value of the shares after the date of exercise will be treated as

[END TABLE]
 either short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss) depending on how long the shares have been held. 
Incentive Stock Options: No income generally will be recognized by a participant upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option (ISO). The exercise of an ISO, however, may result in alternative minimum tax liability. If common shares are issued to the optionee pursuant to the exercise of an ISO, and if no disqualifying disposition of such shares is made by the participant within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the transfer of such shares to the participant, then upon sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price will be taxed to the participant as a long-term capital gain and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss. 
If common shares acquired upon the exercise of an ISO are disposed of prior to the expiration of either holding period described above, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income in the year of disqualifying disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of such shares at the time of exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on the disposition of such shares if a sale or exchange) over the option price paid for such shares. Any further gain (or loss) realized by the participant generally will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss) depending on the holding period. 
Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs): No income will be recognized by a participant in connection with the grant of a SAR. When a SAR is exercised, the participant normally will be required to include as taxable ordinary income in the year of exercise an amount equal to the amount of cash received and the fair market value of any unrestricted common shares received on the exercise. 
Restricted Shares: The recipient of restricted shares generally will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates on the fair market value of the restricted shares (reduced by any amount paid by the participant for such restricted shares) at such time as the shares are no longer subject to forfeiture or restrictions on transfer for purposes of Section 83 of the Code. However, a recipient who so elects under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days of the date of transfer of the shares will have taxable ordinary income on the date of transfer of the shares equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares (determined without regard to the restrictions) over the purchase price, if any, of such restricted shares. If a Code Section 83(b) election has not been made, any dividends received with respect to restricted shares that are subject to the restrictions generally will be treated as compensation (instead of dividend income) that is taxable as ordinary income to the participant. 
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): Generally, the recipient of an RSU award will not recognize income on the grant date. When any part of an RSU award is paid (in the case of cash) or delivered (in the case of unrestricted common shares), the participant will have taxable ordinary income on such date of receipt in an amount equal to the cash or the fair market value of any unrestricted common shares received. 
Performance Shares and Performance Units: No income generally will be recognized by a participant upon the grant of performance shares or performance units. Upon payment in respect of the earn-out of performance shares or performance units, the participant will have taxable ordinary income on the date of receipt in an amount equal to the amount of cash received and the fair market value of any unrestricted common shares received. 
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE COMPANY OR SUBSIDIARY 
To the extent that a participant recognizes ordinary income in the circumstances described above, we or our subsidiary for which the participant performs services will be entitled to a corresponding income tax deduction provided that, among other things, the income meets the test of reasonableness, is an ordinary and necessary business expense, is not an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and is not disallowed by the $1 million limitation on certain executive compensation to our covered employees under Section 162(m) of the Code (Section 162(m)). 
The 2017 Plan was designed to permit the Company to deduct performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). Historically, Section 162(m) limited the annual tax deductibility of compensation paid to certain named executive officers disclosed in our proxy statement (Covered Employees) to $1 million per Covered Employee, unless the compensation qualified as Section 162(m) "performance-based" compensation. 
For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) generally eliminated the "performance-based" compensation exception under Section 162(m), and expanded the $1 million per Covered Employee annual limitation on deductibility to a larger group of named executive officers. In addition, the TCJA also provides that any employee who was a Covered Employee in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2017, will continue to be a Covered Employee for all subsequent taxable years (including taxable years after his or her death). As a

[END TABLE]
 result, the Company may no longer take an annual deduction for any compensation paid to its expanded number of Covered Employees in excess of $1 million per Covered Employee, including compensation relating to awards under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan, as amended, has eliminated certain provisions to reflect this change in law. 
REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC 
We intend to file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 relating to the issuance of additional common shares under the 2017 Plan with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 
 1933, as amended, as soon as practicable after approval of the amendment to the 2017 Plan by our shareholders. 
EXISTING PLAN BENEFITS TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHERS 
Although we cannot currently determine the benefits or number of shares subject to awards that may be granted to participants under the 2017 Plan during the remainder of the 2019 fiscal year or in future periods due to the discretionary nature of the 2017 Plan, we did award our annual equity grants for fiscal 2019 on January 29, 2019. We also made broad-based awards to certain employees during 2018 under the 2017 Plan. 
The following table sets forth with respect to each named executive officer listed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 66 and each group listed below (i) the number of common shares issuable pursuant to performance units granted under the 2017 Plan, (ii) the number of common shares issuable pursuant to stock options granted under the 2017 Plan and (iii) the number of common shares issuable pursuant to RSUs awarded under the 2017 Plan, in each case since the 2017 Plan's inception on April 26, 2017 through February 25, 2019 (without regard to whether any grants were subsequently forfeited, terminated or canceled). It does not include any grants made during this same period under any other compensation plans.

A favorable vote of the majority of votes cast on the matter is necessary for approval of the amendment to the 2017 Plan. Abstentions are considered votes cast on the proposal, and therefore will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted for determining whether the proposal is passed. If the amendment to the 2017 Plan is not approved by shareholders, the 2017 Plan will continue in effect under its current terms, and we will not have sufficient shares available to issue further grants of our common shares in future years beyond the remaining shares available for grants. 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the approval of the amendment to the Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated 2017 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Our Compensation Committee, or the Committee, has oversight responsibility for the development and administration of our executive compensation policies and programs. This "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" describes the material components of our executive pay program for our named executive officers, or the NEOs, identified below, and explains how and why the Committee arrived at specific compensation policies and decisions for our NEOs in 2018. 
Mr. Gerrard B. Schmid joined the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer on February 21, 2018. Mr. Jeffrey Rutherford joined the Company as Interim Chief Financial Officer on October 1, 2018 and was then appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on January 3, 2019. The terms of their employment are summarized on pages 70-71 of this Proxy Statement. 
In addition, two of our NEOs departed. Dr. Juergen Wunram retired from his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer on May 31, 2018, and Christopher A. Chapman departed from his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on October 1, 2018. Both had served as Interim Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs of the Office of the Chief Executive from December 13, 2017 to February 21, 2018. They received payments in accordance with their respective separation agreements which are summarized on page 78 of this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, certain tables and disclosures in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis will exclude Messrs. Wunram and Chapman because their compensation was determined by the terms of their agreements, rather than the Compensation Committee's determination following our year-end performance results.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
YEAR IN REVIEW 
As discussed previously, 2018 was a year of significant change and resetting for Diebold Nixdorf. Over the course of the year, the Company's new Chairman, Board of Directors (including two new independent directors) and new CEO together concluded that our focus should shift to streamlining and simplifying our business operations. The resulting business improvement plan, "DN Now," included three primary work streams: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1)  streamlining management layers and transitioning to a new operating model;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2)  implementing a globally-consistent approach to services through our Services Modernization Plan; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3)  streamlining our product portfolio.  
[END TABLE]
As these plans were being implemented, in the second quarter the Company experienced higher service delivery costs and operational challenges in our supply chain which contributed to lower than expected profit and cash flows. In reaction to our second quarter results and revised outlook, the Company experienced a wave of redemption requests from Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholders and the Company settled these requests, as mandated by German law, by using more than $300 million in cash. These events placed a strain on the Company's liquidity. Under the leadership of the Board of 
 Directors, the Company was able to successfully raise $650 million in debt financing and amend its credit facility. This added liquidity was needed to fund the minority shareholder obligations, support key DN Now transformation initiatives, as well as initiate squeeze-out proceedings of the remaining minority shareholders. The Company then proceeded to onboard a new CFO to align the new focus and initiatives of the Company. 
In the fall, additional DN Now initiatives were implemented to enhance the long-term profitability and cash flows of the business. This included further reduction of G&A expenditures including global spend analytics for finance, real estate, information technology, as well as a company-wide program designed to harvest cash from net working capital. These efforts required significant incremental analysis, planning, collaboration and execution among the leadership team. In recognition of this significant increase in workload, the Compensation Committee and Mr. Schmid adjusted the compensation incentives to better align with the transformational turnaround initiatives. This work resulted in the granting of turnaround bonuses for certain executives and the creation of a Quarterly Bonus Program to drive the desired outcomes at an accelerated pace. These actions were important steps to retain and incentivize key leaders of the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
[END TABLE]
By the fourth quarter, due to the hard work and dedication of our leadership team, the Company experienced significant benefits from DN Now as we delivered the strongest profit and cash flow performance since our combination with Wincor Nixdorf. The expected financial benefit of our DN Now initiatives has increased from approximately $250 million to approximately $400 million of savings through the year 2021. We expect to realize about $160 million in savings in 2019, with progressively more savings to be delivered in 2020 and 2021. 
Under new leadership, the Company overcame the liquidity squeeze in mid-2018 and achieved significantly better financial results in the second half of the year which demonstrates the strength of the new vision for the Company. Critical to this achievement was a renewed compensation program to properly reward and incentivize leaders for moving the Company through and beyond the crisis. We have retained valued members of our team and have been able to recruit new talent to execute our new CEO's dynamic vision while overcoming the unique challenges that we faced mid-year. 
2018 SAY-ON-PAY VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, the advisory vote to approve the executive compensation program for our NEOs received solid support (90% of votes cast), representing a continued trend of positive shareholder support for our executive compensation program. We value the input of our shareholders and are committed to maintaining a dialogue with portfolio managers, corporate governance and executive compensation professionals. In 2018, employees from our Human Resources, Investor Relations and Legal departments engaged with institutions owning about 2/3 of shares outstanding and had meaningful dialogue with and feedback from two leading proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co. regarding the Company and our corporate governance. Shareholder feedback is aggregated and shared with the full Board for consideration. 
Shareholders and the proxy advisory firms provided varying levels of feedback related to pay-for-performance alignment, incentive metrics, and the clarity of our disclosure around our executive compensation structure. We also received feedback regarding interest in diversity statistics, sustainability and director tenure and skillsets. We considered this feedback, as well as the results of last year's Say-on-Pay proposal, as we structured our executive compensation program and drafted the related disclosure. We continue to prioritize our efforts on delivering on our long-term strategic goals and bringing value to our shareholders. 
In addition to these outreach efforts, management met with fund managers who collectively held more than 65% of Diebold Nixdorf's actively-managed shares during 2018. Our recurring investor outreach activities are robust, and include non-deal road shows, analyst meetings, investor conference presentations, phone calls and on-site investor meetings at our headquarters in North Canton, Ohio. We also communicate with shareholders and other stakeholders through our annual reports and SEC filings, proxy statements, press releases, news media and our dieboldnixdorf.com website. We hold conference calls and webcasts for our quarterly earnings releases and other major corporate events which are open to all investors. These calls are available live and materials are also archived on our website. 
We view an on-going, constructive dialogue with our shareholders as critically important to ensuring that our disclosure provides the necessary transparency for them to make proper investment decisions. Engagement with our shareholders helps us better understand how they view the Company and their expectations for our performance, as well as to identify issues that may affect our strategies, corporate governance, valuation and other aspects of our operations.

OUR COMPENSATION STRATEGY 
Our executive pay program is specifically designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Focus on performance metrics that align executives with the creation relative of long-term shareholder value through  performance-based compensation, including the direct utilization of relative total shareholder return, or rTSR;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use metrics that are balanced and support our multi-year integration and transformation program;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage decision-making in alignment with our business strategies, with goal-setting based on a philosophy of continuous  improvement, commitment to becoming a "top tier" performer and supporting our longer-term business transformation strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reflect industry standards, offer globally competitive program design and pay opportunities, and balance our need for talent  with our need to maintain reasonable compensation costs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, motivate, and retain executive talent willing to commit to building long-term shareholder value.   
[END TABLE]
Our 2018 executive compensation structure consists of three primary components: base salary, annual cash bonus, and long-term equity incentives. Within the long-term incentive (LTI) component, we utilize a mix of programs for senior leadership. In 2018, as discussed later in this Proxy Statement, we instituted a Quarterly Bonus Program to align certain senior leaders with the goals established by Mr. Schmid after he joined, and we awarded turnaround bonuses at the end of the year to reward extraordinary effort and accomplishment in the last six months of the year. These awards are described in more detail below under "Quarterly Bonus Program and Turnaround Bonus Awards." Apart from the Quarterly Bonus Program and any turnaround bonuses, our target compensation structure for senior leadership is as follows: 
As provided in more detail below, we generally target total compensation opportunity at or near the size-adjusted 50th percentile of our compensation peer group (for more detail on our peer group, see "Role of Peer Companies and Competitive Market Data" below). The NEOs may be above or below the 50th percentile based on their experience, performance, potential, and impact on shareholder value. Our compensation structure will continue to evolve in support of our DN Now transformation plan.

COMPENSATION DECISION PROCESS 
ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
The Committee is responsible to our Board for oversight of our executive compensation program. The Committee consists of independent directors and is responsible for the review and approval of all aspects of our program. Among its duties, the Committee is responsible for: 
Following review and discussion, the Committee submits recommendations to the Board for ratification. The Committee is supported in its work by the Chief People Officer and staff and an independent compensation consultant, discussed in "Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant" below. For additional information regarding the Committee's duties and responsibilities, see "Compensation Committee" above. 
ROLE OF THE INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT 
The Committee retains an independent compensation consultant, Aon, in accordance with the Committee's charter. The consultant reports directly to the Committee. The Committee retains sole authority to hire or terminate Aon, approve its compensation, determine the nature and scope of services, and evaluate performance. A representative of Aon attends Committee meetings, as requested, and communicates with the Committee Chair between meetings. The Committee makes all final decisions. 
Aon's specific compensation consultation roles include, but are not limited to, the following: 
In 2018, the professional fees for the executive compensation services were approximately $154,000. In addition to Aon's executive compensation services for the Committee, management retained Aon for unrelated services, including brokerage services for insurance products. Professional fees for these unrelated services were approximately $665,000 in 2018. The Board and the Committee considered and approved these additional brokerage services, which were awarded following a competitive process. We have separate relationships with each of the service teams, and the executive compensation service team does not perform any other services on behalf of the Company. Following consideration and review, the Committee determined that these unrelated services did not impact the independence of Aon. 
The Committee assessed the independence of Aon, as required under NYSE listing rules. The Committee also considered and assessed all relevant factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Section 240.10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) under the Exchange Act, that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to Aon. Based on this review, the Committee determined there are no conflicts of interest raised by the work performed by Aon. 
ROLE OF MANAGEMENT 
Our Chief People Officer serves as management's primary contact with the Committee and attends all Committee meetings. For executives other than the CEO position, our CEO and Chief People Officer make pay recommendations to the Committee based on market pay comparisons and an analysis of each executive's individual performance. No member of our management team, including the CEO, has a role in making pay recommendations to the Committee for his or her own position.

ROLE OF PEER COMPANIES AND COMPETITIVE MARKET DATA 
Annually, the Committee reviews competitive total compensation market data provided by Aon. To assess competitive pay levels, the Committee approves our peer group composition. The following criteria are considered: 
In the fall of 2017, the Committee approved the following 17 peer companies to be used in Aon's pay study to assist with 2018 compensation decisions.

Note 1: (*) Denotes new peer for 2018 compensation decisions. 
Note 2: The following companies were removed from the peer group for 2018 compensation decisions: (a) Computer Sciences Corporation due to a merger with HPE Enterprise Services, (b) Lexmark which is no longer publicly traded, and (c) DST which no longer fits our size criteria. 
Note 3: Compensation market values were stress tested to determine the impact, if any, of companies with larger market capitalization. The impact was immaterial. 
The average / median annual revenues for the peer companies were $4.3B and $3.8B, respectively, when the Committee approved the peer group. Size-adjusted market values were developed using our projected annual revenues. The size-adjusted 50th percentile for total compensation is a key reference point for the Committee. For executive positions where peer company proxy data is not available, Aon utilized published and private compensation survey sources. 
Our over-arching goal is to form a consistent set of peer companies to annually develop competitive market data. Periodic adjustments are made to account for changes or shifts in our business. For example, in response to a decline in our market capitalization in the fall of 2018, our Committee closely reviewed potential peer companies to ensure relevance for the fall 2018 pay study to assist with 2019 pay decisions. The Committee will continue to closely monitor peer group composition in future years as it relates to our market capitalization. 
TIMING OF COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
Pay recommendations for our executives, including the NEOs, are typically made by the Committee at its first scheduled meeting of the year, normally held in late January or early 
 February. This meeting is normally held around the same time we report our fourth quarter and year-end financial results for the preceding fiscal year and provide our financial guidance for the upcoming year. This timing allows the Committee to have a complete financial performance picture prior to making compensation decisions. 
Decisions with respect to prior year performance, performance for other relevant periods and any resulting award payouts, as well as annual equity awards, base salary increases and target performance levels for the current year and beyond, are also typically made at this meeting. Equity awards approved by the Committee at this meeting are generally dated as of the date of the Board meeting held the following day. As such, the Committee does not time the grants of options or any other equity incentives to the release of material non-public information. 
The exceptions to this timing are awards to executives who are promoted or hired from outside the Company during the year. These executives may receive base salary increases or equity awards effective or dated, as applicable, as of the date of their promotion or hire.

DETERMINATION OF CEO COMPENSATION 
At the first Committee meeting of the year, in executive session without management present, the Committee reviews and evaluates CEO performance and determines achievement level for the prior fiscal year. The Committee also reviews competitive compensation data for the peer companies. Normally, the Committee presents pay recommendations for the CEO to the independent members of the Board. During executive session, the Board conducts its own review and evaluation of the CEO's performance taking into consideration the recommendations of the Committee. This year, because Mr. Schmid was hired after the meeting, his 2018 compensation was negotiated and approved by the Committee and Board at his time of hire. 
In light of Mr. Chapman's and Dr. Wunram's service as Interim Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs, the Board reviewed the performance of these NEOs in executive session and made determinations as to compensation for the interim service at that time. Each of Mr. Chapman and Dr. Wunram received a stipend of $10,000 per month for each month (or portion thereof) that they served as Interim Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs. The Committee approved this compensation structure with the assistance of Aon's research of competitive market practice for similar situations and management's assessment of the proper internal alignment. 
2018 COMPENSATION ELEMENTS 
BASE SALARY 
Base salary compensates the executive fairly and competitively for the responsibility level of the position. The Committee reviews the salaries of our executive officers annually against competitive market data. Salary adjustments result primarily from a combination of competitive market data, individual and company performance, internal equity considerations, promotions, and the executive's specific responsibilities. 
For 2018, the Committee reviewed competitive market data and individual performance assessments for the NEOs and approved approximately 3% increases to base salary to maintain competitive posture with peer companies.

The rationale for approved 2018 compensation actions is summarized in the table "2018 NEO Compensation Highlights—Target Compensation Structure" above. 
ANNUAL CASH BONUS PLAN 
The NEOs were eligible to earn cash incentives for 2018 under our Annual Cash Bonus Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2015. Performance measures include corporate, business unit and individual performance against pre-determined financial and individual performance metrics approved by the Committee at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Target opportunities: Individual NEO targets (as a percent of base salary) are approved by the Committee at the beginning of the fiscal year. Actual cash bonuses may range from 0% to 200% of target (generally 40% of target is earned at threshold performance, 100% of target is earned at target performance, and 200% of target is earned at maximum performance).

[END TABLE]
Financial performance metrics: For 2018, the Committee approved Corporate non-GAAP Operating Profit (OP) and Corporate Free Cash Flow excluding certain transaction-related expenses (FCF) as the financial performance metrics and Key Business Initiatives specific to each NEO as the individual performance metrics. The Committee also approved a minimum performance level requirement for OP of $150 million, below which no bonuses would be paid, regardless of the performance level attained for FCF, Corporate OP or individual Key Business Initiatives. The Company did achieve $162 million in OP, exceeding the minimum performance requirement. However, there was no payout for this portion of the award because neither non-GAAP OP nor FCF was achieved at or above threshold.

Key Business Initiative performance metrics: Although the Company achieved approximately $162 million in OP, exceeding the minimum performance level of $150 million in OP required to make a payment under the Annual Cash Bonus Plan, the Committee exercised its negative discretion and determined that the portion of the Annual Cash Bonus Plan allocated to Key Business Initiatives would not be paid to the NEOs. As explained in more detail below, upon Mr. Schmid's appointment as Chief Executive Officer, he undertook a strategic review of the Company to define the business critical initiatives that his leadership team needed to achieve over the remaining months of 2018. The Board, in consultation with Mr. Schmid, then established the Quarterly Bonus Program to drive performance of those critical initiatives. 
2018 Actual Bonuses Earned: The NEOs did not receive any bonuses under this Plan for 2018.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES—2018 REGULAR ANNUAL GRANTS 
Our regular annual LTI grants to NEOs include a value mix of performance-based shares (50%), stock options (15%), and RSUs (35%), as discussed above in "2018 NEO Compensation Highlights—Target Compensation Structure." These awards are subject to our other compensation policies generally, such as our Clawback Policy, as discussed in "Other Compensation Policies" below. 
To determine annual grant levels for our NEOs, the Committee considers competitive market data, individual performance, potential future contributions to our business, internal equity, and management's recommendations. The Committee approves long-term incentive grants at its first regular meeting of the year, and actual grants are generally made effective the day following that meeting. 
The following table summarizes 2018 targeted LTI values for our NEOs in accordance with our regular annual LTI grant program.

Performance-based shares (50%): Provide value based on a combination of three-year (2018-2020) TSR ranking versus the S&P 400 Midcap Index companies and our stock price performance. The Committee approved the following performance/payout schedule for the 2018 grant based on TSR ranking for the 2018-2020 performance period: 
Stock options (15%): Provide value based solely on stock price appreciation. Grants of stock options have a ten-year term and vest ratably over a three-year period. The exercise price is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and is valued using the Black-Scholes stock option valuation method. 
RSUs (35%): Provide a base level of retention value in our executive compensation program, and incentive for building shareholder value. RSUs provide additional value if our stock price appreciates. RSUs vest ratably over three years. Dividend equivalents are paid on time-vested RSU grants. 
TURNAROUND BONUS AWARDS AND QUARTERLY BONUS PROGRAM 
As discussed throughout this Proxy Statement, our compensation decisions with respect to 2018 were decided in late January while we conducted a search for our next CEO. After Mr. Schmid joined us, and following his assessment of the Company and the strategic initiatives and decisions that needed to be accomplished in order to improve performance and increase value to our shareholders, the Board and Mr. Schmid agreed that different incentives and goals were required to retain our key leaders, propel our turnaround and reward in line with transformational performance requirements. The turnaround bonuses and Quarterly Bonus Program (which was instituted in the fourth quarter) resulted from this realignment of goals and strategic initiatives. And by the end of the year, despite unexpected challenges including the liquidity crisis, these initiatives began to show results, and we finished the year with fourth quarter profit and cash flow performance that was the strongest since the combination with Wincor Nixdorf.

Turnaround Bonus: In the Committee's 2018 year-end review at the January 2019 meeting, the Committee reviewed and thoroughly assessed the turnaround performance criteria deemed critical by Mr. Schmid over the course of the year. Based on that assessment, the Committee approved turnaround cash bonuses for certain executives based on the evaluation criteria summarized below. As noted earlier, Mr. Rutherford joined the Company in the fourth quarter of 2018 and led the finance team in relation to the critical business criteria summarized below during that time. Due to the date that Mr. Rutherford joined the Company and the fact that the finance team's performance in 2018 had been led by the prior CFO for the majority of the year, the Committee determined that providing Mr. Rutherford with a bonus through the Quarterly Bonus Program was the appropriate recognition for his performance and did not consider him for a turnaround bonus.

Each NEO's performance was measured against business goals that were identified as critical to the Company and its shareholders. These goals served as the primary data point in assessing potential turnaround bonuses and were also considered, particularly with respect to Mr. Rutherford, in connection with the Quarterly Bonus Program, to the extent a goal or initiative was achieved in the fourth quarter 2018. These were not, however, the only measures of performance for purposes of the above bonuses. All NEOs were expected to realize net target savings related to the operating model for their respective area. Mr. Schmid's performance was assessed against achievement and progress towards all identified goals, among other measures.

Quarterly Bonus Program: In the fourth quarter of 2018 following the successful refinancing, the Committee adopted the Quarterly Bonus Program to enhance focus on critical elements of the DN Now initiative and to incentivize near-term completion of key elements. Under that program, the NEOs (as well as certain other participants) were eligible to receive, on a quarterly basis, up to 25% of 150% of their annual base salary. 
 At the end of each quarter, the Compensation Committee assesses the NEO's role in and contribution to the transformation and strategy and determines whether any bonus is earned. The NEO must be employed by the Company at the end of the quarter to potentially qualify. This program will continue until the Committee decides to discontinue it, and is re-evaluated quarterly.

The Quarterly Bonus Plan monitors achievement of transformation performance requirements, as outlined in the DN Now initiative, and underpins the intense turnaround activity taking place at the Company. The Committee assess progress against these key actions, including the following: 
The NEOs earned the following bonuses under the Quarterly Bonus Program:

[END TABLE]
Despite execution on these key initiatives and goals, each NEO finished 2018 with total compensation levels well below targeted amounts. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES—2017 PERFORMANCE-BASED SYNERGY GRANT 
In February 2017, the Committee granted one-time cost synergy performance-based share awards (the Synergy Grants) to certain of the NEOs. The Synergy Grants were made under our 1991 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended, and were implemented in direct response to comments received during our 2016 shareholder outreach campaign that our shareholders wanted an increased focus on cost reduction and acquisition-related synergies. 
The Synergy Grants are intended to incentivize the accelerated achievement of cost reductions and scale efficiencies made possible by our business combination with Wincor Nixdorf. Performance under the awards is based on the achievement of certain levels of "synergy savings," defined as the realized cost reductions resulting from streamlined processes, the elimination of redundant/overlapping cost (including reductions in our workforce and facilities/overhead), and scale efficiencies gained due to the business combination. In 2017, the Committee approved the following metrics and payout schedule for the Synergy Grants based on synergy savings for the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2019.

To incentivize the achievement of savings as quickly as possible, the Committee assessed performance at two interim measurement dates (December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018). If the synergy savings achieved at an interim measurement date are at or above target, then 50% of the performance shares at target are deemed earned as of that measurement date. As of December 31, 2017, the synergy savings were not achieved at target. 
As of December 31, 2018, the synergy savings were achieved above target, with achievement of $205 million in synergy savings. Therefore, 50% of the performance shares were earned on an accelerated basis, as indicated in the following table. The table also includes the 2017 Synergy Grant values at target for the NEOs, which were derived from a percentage of salary ranging between 70% and 100%. The final payout will be determined by the level of cumulative synergy savings for the three-year performance period with amounts between threshold, target, and maximum calculated on a straight-line basis. The payout at the end of the performance period will be reduced by the number of performance shares already earned by the recipient as of the December 31, 2018 interim measurement date.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES—2017 PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS 
In 2017, following our acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf, legacy Wincor Nixdorf employees continued to hold a portion of their incentive compensation in Wincor Nixdorf stock options. In order to incentivize these employees around the combined Company's performance, in 2017 we made an offer to certain employees to replace their outstanding Wincor Nixdorf stock options with performance-based cash incentive awards (the DN Performance Awards). 
The objective of this program was to simply convert existing Wincor Nixdorf stock options into a performance-based cash incentive for the newly-combined Company. It was not additional value. Without the employee's agreement to cancel the outstanding Wincor Nixdorf stock options, they would remain in place and be payable based on the Wincor Nixdorf stock price until the stock options expire or lapse or stop trading. 
The grant of the DN Performance Awards was contingent on the employee's agreement to cancel his or her outstanding 
 Wincor Nixdorf options. These awards were granted by the Compensation Committee under our shareholder-approved Annual Cash Bonus Plan and were effective May 1, 2017. Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden participated in this offer. 
The DN Performance Awards replaced the Wincor Nixdorf stock options vesting in March of 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Each tranche of stock options had a different vest date and a different "in the money" value, and so each tranche was replaced with a DN Performance Award that had the same measurement date (of 2018, 2019 or 2020). Each award is structured to approximate the original "in-the money" value of the cancelled options at target, the option "under water" line at threshold, and a maximum at approximately 155% of our stock price. If the threshold price is not met, there will be no payment of the award. Any cash amount earned between threshold, target, and maximum will be calculated on a straight-line basis. The measurement of the share price for purposes of the DN Performance Awards will be based upon the average share price of our stock for the 20-day trading period prior to the end of the applicable performance period.

BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES 
We provide our North America-based executives with medical, dental, and life insurance under the same programs used to provide benefits to all North America-based associates within their applicable country of residence. Our executives may buy additional life insurance coverage at their own expense. The maximum life insurance coverage that may be purchased by an executive is $1 million. Our North America-based executives' personal benefits are not tied to individual or Company performance and changes to these benefits reflect the changes to the benefits of all North America-based associates within their country of residence. Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden receive certain fringe benefits pursuant to their service agreements with Diebold Nixdorf AG, which are not tied to individual or Company performance. 
DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
Our executives, including the NEOs, may elect to defer receipt of compensation from the Annual Cash Bonus Plan and performance-based shares pursuant to our Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan No. 2 (as discussed below under "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans"). Current investment choices under the plan for cash deferrals (cash bonuses and dividends on deferred performance shares) mirror those in our 401(k) plan. Our deferred compensation plan does not provide participants with additional pay, but merely provides a tax deferred investment vehicle. Moreover, we do not guarantee any specific rate of return and do not contribute to the return that may be earned. 
RETIREMENT 
We maintain qualified and non-qualified retirement programs for our U.S. executives. Our U.S. executives, including the NEOs, participate in our qualified defined benefit (pension) and defined contribution (401(k)) plans on the same terms as all U.S.-based associates. In 2013, we amended the pension plan to cease future benefit accruals for all participants after December 31, 2013. Similarly, we also maintain broad-based defined contribution plans qualified in Canada for the benefit of our Canadian employees. Mr. Schmid participates in these deferred profit sharing and retirement savings plans on the same terms as all Canadian-based associates. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS       
     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS       
[END TABLE]
We also have two non-qualified supplemental retirement plans in which certain NEOs participate: (1) the Pension Restoration Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or Pension Restoration SERP, and (2) the 401(k) Restoration Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or 401(k) Restoration SERP. These plans are described in detail below under "2017 Pension and Retirement Benefits." Participation in the 401(k) Restoration SERP is based on the annual IRS compensation limits. Participation in the Pension Restoration SERP is limited to executive officers in positions that help develop, implement and modify our long-term strategic plan, as nominated by the CEO and approved by the Committee; however, we closed the Pension Restoration SERP to any new participants effective July 1, 2013 and also amended the plan to cease future benefit accruals after December 31, 2013. Mr. Chapman participates in the Pension Restoration SERP and Mr. Leiken participates in the 401(k) Restoration SERP. 
Mr. Heyden and Drs. Wunram and Näher participate in the Wincor Nixdorf AG Pension Scheme (the Wincor Pension Plan) pursuant to their service agreements. The Wincor Pension Plan is a contribution-defined pension system based on a one-time payout or installment payments and governed by the rules outlined in the Wincor Nixdorf International GmbH Pension Scheme. Their service agreements in effect for 2018 provided for certain annual contribution commitments as follows: €50,000 to each of Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden, and €100,000 for Dr. Wunram in accordance with the agreement that the Company entered into with him upon retirement. 
PERQUISITES AND FRINGE BENEFITS 
We provide our executives with limited perquisites. The Committee believes that these benefits are set at a reasonable level, are highly valued by recipients, have limited cost to the Company, are part of a competitive reward system, and help in attracting and retaining top management talent. The Committee periodically reviews our practices in this area and makes any necessary adjustments based on market trends and the cost to provide these benefits. 
Perquisites received by North America-based executives include the following, the values of which differ based on an executive's reporting level: 
Contractual fringe benefits paid to Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden under their service agreements include accident and liability insurance, health insurance, and subsidy pension insurance premiums paid by the Company and lease payments on a company car. Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden also receive reimbursement for financial planning services up to $14,000 for Dr. Wunram and $10,000 for Mr. Heyden and Dr. Näher. Mr. Heyden will also be reimbursed for up to an additional $70,000 in connection with tax advisory fees arising from his employment situation following our business combination. 
CHANGE IN CONTROL PROTECTION 
We maintain change in control agreements for certain executive officers, including Messrs. Schmid, Rutherford and Leiken, which provide our executives with the potential for continued employment (or benefits) for three years following a change in control. The other NEOs do not currently have change in control agreements. 
The benefits available under the agreements are subject to a "double trigger," so that benefits are paid only following both (i) a change in control (as defined in the agreement) and (ii) a termination of the executive's employment without cause by us or with good reason by the executive (as such terms are defined in the agreement) in the three-year period following a change in control. 
The agreements include the following items: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
[END TABLE]
The Committee periodically reviews our policy with respect to these change in control agreements, and engages its independent compensation consultant to provide a competitive analysis of our practices. The Committee has determined that this type of agreement is still a valued component of overall compensation for purposes of attracting and retaining quality executive officers and, as such, the Committee approved the continued award of these agreements to new executives. 
SEVERANCE PROTECTION 
Our Senior Leadership Severance Plan provides coverage to executives who are involuntarily terminated without cause or who terminate their employment for good reason, in each case separate from a change in control and subject to a general release of claims and acknowledgement of the executive's confidentiality, non-competition and other applicable obligations. 
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
Historically, in order to attract high-quality candidates, we have entered into formal employment agreements with our CEO. On February 21, 2018, we entered into an offer letter with our new President and CEO, Gerrard Schmid. That offer letter is discussed in more detail under "Mr. Schmid Offer Letter" on page 70. 
Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden had service agreements in place with Wincor Nixdorf prior to the acquisition. As part of our business combination, they received offer letters in February 2017, and their service agreements will continue in effect until February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. These agreements are discussed in more detail under "Service Agreements with Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden" and in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control—Potential Termination Payments under Service Agreements—Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden" sections. 
None of Messrs. Rutherford, Leiken or Chapman had or have employment agreements. On January 31, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Mr. Chapman related to the potential accelerated vesting of his performance based shares, RSUs, options and other types of equity that may be granted in the near future. If Mr. Chapman's employment were terminated other than for cause or if he left our employ for good reason during the two years after we hire a new chief executive officer, then he would be deemed to have met certain age and continuous service requirements necessary for the continued or accelerated vesting for the performance shares, RSUs, options and other equity awards in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements. Awards granted prior to 2017 would not be subject to such treatment.

OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES 
CLAWBACK POLICY 
In addition to any other rights or remedies legally available to us, all of our equity plans include provisions that allow us to cancel awards or "claw back" any shares received pursuant to awards or the exercise of stock options for certain specified conduct that is deemed detrimental to the Company. To the extent that an executive has already received value for such awards, these provisions also allow us to seek reimbursement of such value directly from the executive or through the garnishment of salary or cash bonus. Examples of such detrimental conduct include: 
In addition, the Committee has a separate and independent Clawback Policy which provides an additional avenue to recover excessive performance-based incentive compensation (whether equity or cash) paid during a three-year look-back period in the event of a willful act of misconduct resulting in an obligation on the Company to prepare a financial accounting restatement due to a material noncompliance with any reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws. This policy will be updated as necessary when the claw back requirements under Dodd Frank are fully effective. 
INSIDER TRADING POLICY 
Under our Insider Trading Policy, each employee, officer and director of the Company is prohibited from buying or selling our securities when he or she is aware of material, non-public information about the Company, or information about other public companies which he or she learns as our employee or director. These individuals are also prohibited from providing such information to others. In addition, this policy prohibits employees, officers and directors from pledging Diebold Nixdorf stock, engaging in short sales of Diebold Nixdorf stock, and from buying or selling any derivative securities related to Diebold Nixdorf stock. 
COMPANY-IMPOSEDBLACK-OUT PERIODS 
As noted above, if an executive is in possession of material non-public information, he or she is prohibited from trading in our stock. Apart from these trading restrictions, we also impose routine black-out periods that prohibit executives, including the NEOs, from trading during the period that begins two weeks prior to the end of each quarter and extends through the second business day following our next scheduled quarterly earnings release. These self-imposed black-out periods are an example of good corporate governance and help to protect both us and the individual from allegations of insider trading violations. 
However, our black-out policy was not intended to penalize employees for this type of positive corporate behavior and, in the past, the Committee has approved a cash distribution to employees, including NEOs, who were barred from exercising stock options prior to their expiration due to extended company-imposed black-out periods. No such exceptions were made during 2018. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
The Committee believes that stock ownership guidelines reinforce executive and shareholder alignment. Our executive stock ownership guidelines are: 
The Committee monitors progress towards achievement for the stated guidelines annually. In determining an executive's stock holdings, we count the shares beneficially owned, including the after-tax value of unvested RSUs, shares deferred pursuant to our deferred compensation program, and shares owned through our 401(k) savings plan. Outstanding stock options and unearned performance shares do not count towards the executives' stock ownership guidelines. Our executives are not allowed to sell shares until they meet the guidelines. 
TAX REFORM AND LIMITATIONS ON DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION 
Prior to December 22, 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limited the deductibility of executive compensation paid by publicly-held corporations to $1 million per year for the CEO and the next three most highly compensated executive officers, excluding the CFO. The $1 million limitation did not apply to compensation that qualifies as performance-based. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
[END TABLE]
Under the TCJA, the performance-based exception has been repealed and the $1 million deduction limit now applies to anyone serving as the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year and the top three other highest compensated executive officers serving at fiscal year-end. The new rules generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but do not apply to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect after that date. 
To the extent possible and consistent with the goals and philosophy of compensation stated throughout, the Committee endeavors to limit the impact of Section 162(m) of the Code. The Committee also believes that the tax deduction is only one of several relevant considerations in setting compensation and that the tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise the Company's ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract and retain the executive talent to compete successfully. Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.

1   Earned salary amounts reported for Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden are included in the table in U.S.  dollars, but these executives receive their salaries in Euros. To convert their 2018 Euro salary amounts to U.S. dollars for the table, we used the average Euro to U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate for 2018 of 1.1815. For Dr. Wunram  and Mr. Chapman, this amount also reflects the Co-CEO-stipend for January and February 2018. For Mr. Chapman, this amount reflects salary earned for 2018 and  cash paid to Mr. Chapman in lieu of vacation in connection with his departure.

3   2018 amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718  (ASC 718), for RSUs and performance-based LTI shares awarded to the NEOs in 2018. Pursuant to SEC rules, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. The grant date values in the table  and this footnote do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the NEOs. The grant date fair values for the RSUs are determined using the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The grant date fair values  included in the table for the annual performance-based LTI shares are calculated based on the probable outcome of the relevant performance conditions as of the grant date, which we calculate using a Monte Carlo simulation model. See the  "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below for the threshold, target and maximum numbers of shares that each NEO may earn under these performance-based LTI awards and Footnote 5 to that table for additional information on  assumptions used in calculating the grant date valuations. The ASC 718 grant date fair values for each NEO's 2018 performance-based LTI awards assuming the achievement of the maximum level of performance would be: for Mr. Schmid,  $5,023,930; for Dr. Wunram, $1,854,153; for Mr. Chapman, $1,596,679; for Dr. Näher, $1,221,641; for Mr. Heyden, $1,221,641; and for Mr. Leiken, $989,235.

For more information regarding 2018 grants, see the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below. Pursuant to SEC rules, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based  vesting conditions.

6   The amount shown for Messrs. Chapman and Heyden and Drs. Wunram and Näher is the difference (to the extent positive)  between the actuarial present value of pension benefits as of December 31, 2018 and the actuarial present value of pension benefits as of December 31, 2017 under the pension plans in which they participate. For Mr. Chapman, this  amount was $(64,490) and therefore this decrease is not included in the column above. For Mr. Chapman, the actuarial present value as of December 31, 2018 is calculated based on a 4.34% discount rate and the  RP-2014 mortality tables, including the MP-2018 generational projection scales. The actuarial present value of pension benefits as of December 31, 2017 is based on  a 3.71% discount rate and the RP-2014 Mortality Table including the MP-2017 generational projection scales. The values were determined assuming the probability is nil  that Mr. Chapman will terminate, retire, die or become disabled before his normal retirement date (unless already known). The decrease in pension value is attributable to the increase in the discount rate and the mortality assumption change.  For Mr. Heyden and Drs. Wunram and Näher, the actuarial present value is calculated based on a 1.5% discount rate and assuming that the probability is nil of termination, death, disability or retirement before normal retirement age. The  increase in pension values are attributable to the additional accrued benefits.

CEO PAY-RATIO DISCLOSURE 
Under Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer, and the ratio of these two amounts. In calculating this ratio, we are required to identify our median employee once every three years and calculate total compensation for that employee each year. 
We identified our median employee on December 1, 2017, and there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements during 2018 that we reasonably believe would impact the pay ratio disclosures for 2018. 
After identifying the median employee based on annualized base salaries, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee for 2018 using the same methodology we used for our NEOs as set forth in the above 2018 Summary Compensation Table. We have estimated the annual total compensation of our median employee, excluding our CEO, to be $35,383. As reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, the total compensation of Mr. Schmid, our President and CEO, was $6,899,832. Since Mr. Schmid was appointed to this position effective February 21, 2018, we annualized his salary (in the amount of $950,000), and the value of life insurance and AD&D premiums and supplemental executive disability insurance included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table (in the total amount of $19,057) to reflect a total annualized compensation in the amount of $7,035,279. We did not annualize the bonus, stock awards, non-equity incentive awards and option awards columns of the Summary Compensation Table, as these items consisted of one-time inducement grants, reflected full year awards or were awarded under compensation programs not in effect on the date of his hire. For 2018, the ratio of the total compensation of our President and CEO to the estimated median of the annual total compensation of our employees was approximately 199 to 1. We believe this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. 
Because the SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio for our Company, as other companies have offices in different countries, have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

2   These columns present information about performance-based LTI shares awarded during 2018 pursuant to the 2017 Plan. The  payout of the performance-based LTI shares will be determined based on the achievement of specific relative TSR goals calculated over the three-year period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020. The maximum award  amount for the performance-based LTI awards is 200% of the target amount, which will be earned only if we achieve maximum performance pursuant to the grant's specific performance measures, and no amount is payable unless the threshold  performance is met. For a more detailed description of these awards and the related performance measures, see the related descriptions above in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."

5   For the annual performance-based LTI shares, the grant date fair value of $24.29 ($16.14 for Mr. Schmid) per share as  of the grant date was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that considers the likelihood of our TSR ending at various percentile levels and expected stock price at those levels and which reflects the probable outcome of the performance  conditions at target as of the grant date, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures, in accordance with ASC 718. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the performance-based LTI shares were as follows: (a) an expected  performance period of three years; (b) a risk-free interest rate of 2.32% (2.41% for Mr. Schmid), which is an estimated interest rate for a zero-coupon U.S. government bond with a term commensurate  with the remaining term of the performance period as of the grant date (2.91 years (2.86 years for Mr. Schmid)), calculated by linear interpolation of the interest rates on the grant date for zero coupon U.S. government bonds with maturities of  2.50 and 3.0 years; (c) historical volatilities of the Company and peer group, calculated using the adjusted daily stock prices for the 2.91 year period (2.86 year period for Mr. Schmid) prior to the grant date; and (d) a dividend  yield for the Company and any of the peer group companies in the period from January 1, 2018 to February 1, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      For RSUs, the fair value is calculated using the closing market price of the shares on the applicable grant date ($18.75  ($14.90 for Mr. Schmid)), and such value reflects the total amount that we would expect to expense in our financial statements over the awards' three-year vesting period. For stock options, the fair value was calculated using the  Black-Scholes value on the grant date of $4.49 ($3.71 for Mr. Schmid), calculated in accordance with ASC 718. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these stock options can be found under Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

MR. SCHMID OFFER LETTER 
In connection with Mr. Schmid's appointment as our President and CEO on February 21, 2018, we entered into an offer letter pursuant to which Mr. Schmid will receive an annual base salary of at least $950,000 and will be eligible for annual incentive awards and long-term incentive plan awards as determined by the Company. For 2018, the Board set his initial annual cash incentive award target at $1,330,000, which represents 140% of his base salary. Any payout under this incentive award shall be determined by the Board based on the achievement of certain performance goals. 
The Board also granted Mr. Schmid options, performance share units and RSUs as a material inducement to his hiring. Pursuant to the terms of the CEO Inducement Award Agreement, dated February 21, 2018 (the CEO Award Agreement), Mr. Schmid received (i) 192,049 options with an exercise price of $15.35 per share and which will vest in three equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversary of the grant date; (ii) 155,636 performance share units, which will be earned, if at all, based on the target level of achievement of established performance metrics during the performance period, which begins on his date of hire and ends on December 31, 2020; and (iii) 108,945 RSUs, which will vest in three equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date. This inducement award was approved by all of the Company's independent directors and was made outside of the terms of the 2017 Plan. Once vested, equity grants will not be subject to forfeiture unless Mr. Schmid is terminated for certain activities constituting cause (as defined in the CEO Award Agreement). In the event Mr. Schmid's employment is terminated by us without cause or he resigns for good reason (as defined in the CEO Award Agreement) within three years after a change in control, he will be entitled to 100% accelerated vesting of all such outstanding equity interests, with performance awards earned at the greater of target or actual performance as of the date of termination. 
Mr. Schmid's severance benefits will be governed by our current Senior Leadership Severance Plan, which provides coverage to executives who are involuntarily terminated without cause or who terminate their employment for good reason, in each case separate from a change in control and subject to a general release of claims and acknowledgement of the executive's confidentiality, non-competition and other applicable obligations. With respect to Mr. Schmid, "good reason" as defined in the Senior Leadership Severance Plan shall also include a change in title, authority, duties or responsibilities or the assignment of any duties that are inconsistent with his position. 
We also entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Schmid consistent with our existing program. Any benefits under the Change in Control Agreement are paid only following both (1) a change in control (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) and (2) a termination of Mr. Schmid's employment without cause by the Company, or by him with good reason (as such terms are defined in the Change in Control Agreement) in the three-year period following a change in control. Under such circumstances, Mr. Schmid may be eligible for (i) a lump sum payment equal to two times base salary and target cash bonus, (ii) the acceleration of outstanding equity awards, (iii) payment of outstanding performance awards at the greater of target or actual performance, (iv) two years of continued participation in our health and welfare benefit plans, and (v) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the additional benefits Mr. Schmid would have accrued under each qualified or nonqualified pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation or supplemental plan for one additional year of service, provided he was fully vested prior to termination, including pro rata payment of his annual incentive award at the greater of target or actual performance.

[BEGIN TABLE]
       insurance premiums paid by the Company, financial planning services, and lease payments on a company car.  
[END TABLE]
The short-term cash incentive award under our Annual Cash Bonus Plan is dependent on the attainment of specific targets set by us at the beginning of each fiscal year, and adopted by the Supervisory Board of Diebold Nixdorf AG (the Supervisory Board).

[END TABLE]
Mr. Chapman participates in the Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, or Qualified Retirement Plan, which provides funded, tax-qualified benefits under the Internal Revenue Code to all salaried and non-union hourly U.S.-based employees who were hired before July 1, 2003. This plan provides benefits that are limited by Internal Revenue Code requirements applicable to all tax-qualified pension plans. As noted above, we also maintain defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans, or SERPs, which provide unfunded, non-qualified benefits to select executives. The purpose of the SERPs is to provide additional benefits above those provided under the Qualified Retirement Plan. Accruals in the Qualified Retirement Plan and the defined benefit SERPs were frozen as of December 31, 2013. 
QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLAN 
The benefit provided under the Qualified Retirement Plan is payable as a life annuity beginning at normal retirement age (age 65). The benefit is determined based on the following formula: 
In addition, a benefit equal to $50.40 times the number of years of service (subject to a maximum of 30 years) is added to the amount determined above. 
Final average compensation is an average of the five highest consecutive full calendar years of salary and bonus out of the last ten full calendar years, with each year's compensation held to a maximum of the IRS compensation limit for that year. The participant's individual "Covered Compensation" is as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. The benefit is payable for the lifetime of the participant, with alternative forms of payment available to the participant with an actuarial reduction. 
Participants may retire early if they are at least age 50 and the sum of their age plus service is at least 70, or at any age with 30 years of service. Benefits may begin upon retirement on an actuarially-reduced basis. Participants with at least 15 years of service who become disabled while employed are eligible for an immediate unreduced benefit. Participants terminating with at least five years of service are entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65, or may commence the benefit on an actuarially-reduced basis, if they are at least age 50 and the sum of their age plus service is at least 70. 
PENSION RESTORATION SERP 
Benefits under the Pension Restoration SERP are determined using the same formula as stated above for the Qualified 
 Retirement Plan except the IRS compensation limit is ignored. Net benefits payable from the Pension Restoration SERP at age 65 equal the difference between the benefit determined using total pensionable pay, ignoring qualified plan compensation limits, and the benefit payable from the Qualified Retirement Plan. All other provisions of the Pension Restoration SERP are identical to the Qualified Retirement Plan with the exception of the actuarial reduction factors for retirement before age 65. The Pension Restoration SERP was amended in 2013 to freeze all future benefit accruals after December 31, 2013. 
GERMAN PENSION BENEFITS 
Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden participate in the Wincor Pension Plan pursuant to their service agreements. The Wincor Pension Plan is a contribution-defined pension system, and is based on a one-time payout or up to ten annual installment payments. They are entitled to the pension payments when reaching the age of sixty. However, if they remain on the Wincor Nixdorf management board in an active capacity beyond this period, the receipt of retirement benefits will be deferred until the end of their service agreement. In the event that the executive continues to hold a position on the Wincor Nixdorf management board, the actual pensions and/or one-time payout benefits will be higher than those presented in the table, particularly as a result of future financing contributions. The amounts credited to the pension accounts bear interest at 3.5% per year. 
PRESENT VALUE OF ACCUMULATED BENEFITS 
The Present Value of Accumulated Benefits is the single-sum value as of December 31, 2018 of the annual pension benefit that was earned through that date payable under a plan beginning at the NEO's normal retirement age. 
The normal retirement age is defined as age 65 for the Qualified Retirement Plan and Pension Restoration SERP. We used certain assumptions to determine the single-sum value of the annual benefit that is payable beginning at normal retirement age. The key assumptions are as follows: 
The normal retirement age for Drs. Wunram and Näher and Mr. Heyden under the Wincor Nixdorf AG Pension Scheme is 60. The key assumptions are as follows:

No  portion of this amount is reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column or the "Salary" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" except current-year Registrant Contributions and Executive Contributions,  respectively. Of these balances, $12,707 was reported for Mr. Leiken as executive and registrant contributions in summary compensation tables in prior year proxy statements.

NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS 
DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN NO. 2 
Pursuant to our 1992 Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan, certain executives, including the NEOs, were able to defer cash bonuses received under our Annual Cash Bonus Plan and performance-based share awards earned under the 1991 Plan; however, none of the NEOs were participants in this Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan in 2018. Effective December 31, 2004, as a result of the passage by Congress of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we elected to freeze the 1992 Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan and closed the plan to future deferrals. Effective January 1, 2005, the Board approved the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan No. 2, which is substantially similar to the 1992 Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan in all material respects, but was designed to be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Under the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan No. 2, an executive may defer all or a portion of his or her annual cash bonus or performance-based share amount. Deferral elections for cash bonuses must be made prior to the end of the year preceding the year in which such bonuses would be earned (and payable in the following year). Deferral elections for performance-based shares must be made at least six months prior to the end of the three-year performance period specified in the grant. 
Deferrals of performance-based shares are treated as a line-item in the executive's deferred account with us; however, the earnings on the performance shares (dividends and interest) are invested in the same manner as deferrals of cash compensation. Executives may invest such cash deferrals in any funds available under our 401(k) plan, except the Northern Trust, Invesco Stable Value Fund and Diebold Inc. Stock Fund. The table below shows the funds available under the deferred compensation plans and their annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2018, as reported by Merrill Lynch.

Executives deferring under the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan No. 2 select their period of deferral and method of payment at the time of making their deferral elections. Executives may elect to defer their payments until a specified date or until the date they cease to be an associate of the Company. Further, the executives may elect to receive their distribution either as a lump sum or in approximately equal quarterly installments, not to exceed 40 installments. 
401(K) RESTORATION SERP 
The 401(k) Restoration SERP is designed to replace lost retirement benefits due solely to IRS compensation limits. Benefits under this plan are determined exactly as in our 401(k) Plan except that compensation limits are ignored. NEOs are permitted to elect to defer compensation above the annual IRS limit and we provide a matching contribution at the same rate as under the 401(k) Plan. Both the salary deferrals and our matching contributions may be invested in any funds available under our Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan No. 2. Mr. Leiken participates in the 401(k) Restoration SERP. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
The amount of compensation payable to each NEO upon voluntary or involuntary termination (with and without cause), retirement, death, disability or in the event of a change in control (with and without termination) is described qualitatively in the following narrative and is shown quantitatively in the tables below. The amounts shown assume that such termination or change in control was effective as of December 31, 2018, include amounts earned through such date, and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon his termination or change in control. As Dr. Wunram and Mr. Chapman's separations from the Company occurred prior to December 31, 2018, they are not included in the tables below. Further, as Mr. Rutherford was an independent contractor of the Company as of December 31, 2018, he was not entitled to any such payments upon termination or change in control at that time. Beginning in 2019, Mr. Rutherford will be treated similar to Messrs. Schmid and Leiken in terms of his participation in and rights to benefits and payments in the event of termination or change in control. 
The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of each NEO's separation. Messrs. Schmid and Leiken participate in our Senior Leadership Severance Policy. Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden have employment agreements, and their rights upon termination are set forth in those agreements. The employment agreements for Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden are structured in a different manner from the other NEOs with respect to termination payments, and so we have summarized their rights to payments separately, immediately following the discussion of the other NEOs that follows. Our stock price as of December 31, 2018 was $2.49.

PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS IN CONNECTION WITH DR. WUNRAM'S RETIREMENT 
Dr. Wunram retired from his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer on May 31, 2018. In connection with his retirement, the Company and Dr. Wunram agreed that he would receive the following: 
In addition, all of Dr. Wunram's outstanding stock options and RSUs vest in accordance with the terms of their agreements, and Dr. Wunram remains eligible to receive his performance-based share awards and his performance-based cash incentive awards as if his employment had not terminated and pursuant to the terms of those awards. 
PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS IN CONNECTION WITH MR. CHAPMAN'S SEPARATION 
Mr. Chapman left the Company on October 1, 2018, to pursue other opportunities. In connection with his departure and subject to compliance with non-competition and non-solicitation obligations, Mr. Chapman was entitled to receive compensation (i) under the Company's Senior Leadership Severance Plan with respect to termination of his employment without cause and (ii) pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Mr. Chapman dated January 31, 2018, as follows: 
Mr. Chapman and the Company also entered into a consulting agreement whereby Mr. Chapman agreed to assist in the transition of his responsibilities through January 15, 2019 in exchange for a one-time payment in the amount of $300,000 and continued eligibility under his performance-based synergy award granted in 2017. 
PAYMENTS MADE UPON TERMINATION—MESSRS. SCHMID AND LEIKEN 
VOLUNTARY WITHOUT GOOD REASON OR INVOLUNTARY WITH CAUSE 
Whether a NEO's employment terminates voluntarily without "good reason" or terminates involuntarily with "cause" (as those terms may be defined in various agreements), he is generally only entitled to base salary earned through the date of termination, along with any deferred compensation earnings payable upon separation from service and any benefits that have accrued under our Qualified Retirement Plan and any SERP or 401(k) plan (except that no employer-paid SERP benefits are payable in the event of involuntary termination with cause). The Qualified Retirement Plan benefit, under both termination scenarios, and the SERP benefit, if termination is voluntary, is determined as described in "2018 Pension and Retirement Benefits" above. If termination is involuntary with cause, only the portion of the 401(k) Restoration Plan benefit derived from employee contributions and qualified defined benefit plan vested benefit are payable to the NEO. The 401(k) Restoration SERP balances are not payable until the NEO attains age 55. 
INVOLUNTARY WITHOUT CAUSE OR VOLUNTARY WITH GOOD REASON 
If a NEO is involuntarily terminated without cause, he is entitled to the following (subject to a general release of claims and acknowledgment of the executive's confidentiality, non-competition and other applicable obligations): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment equal to two times (for Mr. Schmid) and one and one-half  times (for Mr. Leiken) base salary in effect on the date of termination and target bonus

[BEGIN TABLE]
       opportunity under our Annual Cash Bonus Plan in the year of termination;  
[END TABLE]
The Pension Restoration SERP and 401(k) Restoration SERP do not provide any additional benefits upon an involuntary termination. The NEO is only entitled to a SERP benefit if he otherwise qualifies for a normal, early or deferred vested SERP benefit at termination. 
For Mr. Leiken, the nonqualified defined contribution plan values shown reflect the vested balances in the 401(k) Restoration SERP. 
For all applicable NEOs, we have included the value of their vested nonqualified defined contribution balances, footnoting that these amounts are not payable until the NEO attains age 55. 
Pursuant to the Senior Leadership Severance Plan, if a NEO terminates his employment due to the occurrence of any of the following events without his consent and following our right to cure, each of which constitute the basis for "good reason," he will be entitled to receive the payments and benefits discussed immediately above: 
PAYMENTS MADE UPON RETIREMENT 
Generally, in the event of the retirement of a NEO at or after the earliest voluntary retirement age, in addition to the benefits identified above under "Voluntary Without Good Reason or Involuntary With Cause," he is entitled to the following: 
The amount shown for Mr. Leiken also includes the value of his vested nonqualified defined contribution balance in the 401(k) Restoration SERP. Retirement eligibility is age 55 under the 401(k) Restoration SERP. 
PAYMENTS MADE UPON DEATH OR DISABILITY 
In the event of the death of a NEO, the NEO or his estate or beneficiaries receives:

If a NEO has a termination from employment for disability that is a "separation from service," as that term is defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the NEO has the right to receive the same benefits as if he were terminated without cause, as listed above. 
NEOs who die while actively employed are eligible for surviving spouse benefits from the Qualified Retirement Plan payable at the NEO's normal retirement date (or on an actuarially-reduced basis at an early retirement date) if the NEO had at least five years of service. The benefit is equal to 50% of the benefit payable if the NEO terminated employment on the date of his death, survived to the payment date as elected by his spouse, and elected to begin receiving the 50% joint and survivor form of payment. Benefits payable to the surviving spouse upon death of the NEO from the Pension Restoration SERP are payable at the later of the executive's early retirement date or date of death. For the Pension Restoration SERP, the death benefit is equal to 50% of the benefit, actuarially adjusted for the difference in age between the NEO and spouse, that would have been payable to the executive if he terminated employment on the date of death and survived to his first payment date. NEOs must have five years of service at the time of death for death benefits to be payable under the Pension Restoration SERP. The 401(k) Restoration SERP pays a death benefit equal to the executive's plan account if the executive had ten years of service and three years of service, respectively. 
Disability benefits are payable immediately on an unreduced basis from the Qualified Retirement Plan based on service at the date of disability if the NEO had at least 15 years of service and was determined to be totally and permanently disabled. 
Disability benefits under the Pension Restoration SERP are payable immediately on an unreduced basis for disability after the NEO has at least 15 years of service. Disability benefits under the 401(k) Restoration SERP are payable immediately on an unreduced basis. 
For the defined benefit plans, we have shown the present value of the death benefits payable to the NEO's spouse in case of the NEO's death as of December 31, 2018. For the Qualified Retirement Plan and Pension Restoration SERP, the values shown reflect the present value of the early retirement benefits. 
Under the disability scenario for the defined benefit plans, we have reflected the present value of the immediately payable benefit if the NEO is eligible for disability as of the measurement date. In determining the value of the disability benefits, we used the RP-2014 Disabled Retirees mortality table with fully generational projection using MP-2018 and the assumptions noted under "Present Value of Accumulated Benefits" above. 
For both the death and disability scenarios, for all NEOs, we have included the value of their vested nonqualified defined contribution balances which are payable immediately. 
PAYMENTS UPON A TERMINATION FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Pursuant to the change in control agreements described previously, following a change in control, the term of employment for each NEO will extend until at least the third anniversary of the change in control. If, within that time period, an NEO's employment is terminated without cause or if the NEO terminates his employment for good reason, the NEO is entitled to the following benefits: 
Pursuant to the terms of the applicable equity compensation agreements, if following the change in control the NEO is terminated without cause or he terminates employment for good reason, the NEO is entitled to the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
        EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS   
[END TABLE]
For all of these agreements, a change in control is deemed to occur upon any of the following events (subject to limited exceptions described in such agreements): 
Further, for purposes of the equity compensation agreements and the change in control agreements, a voluntary termination by a NEO upon a change in control will be deemed for good reason upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       miles from his previous location of work, or requires the NEO to travel significantly more than was previously required; or  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of calculating the retirement benefits payable when a change in control occurs with termination, each NEO actively employed as of December 31, 2018 may be entitled to the following: 
For the Qualified Retirement Plan, the Pension SERP and the Pension Restoration SERP, we have reflected, in the Post-Termination Payments Tables below the present value of the accrued benefit payable at normal retirement. Under the terms of the defined benefit SERPs, these benefits are payable at the later of the executive's early retirement date or the date of a change in control with termination. 
For the 401(k) Restoration SERP, the change in control trigger provides for the immediate vesting of all defined contribution balances, as well as an additional year of employer match. These balances are not payable to the NEO until he has attained at least age 55 under the terms of the nonqualified defined contribution plans. 
EFFECT OF SECTION 409A ON TIMING OF PAYMENTS 
With respect to any severance amounts payable to our executives, any amounts that are not exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code will be subject to the required six-month delay in payment after termination of service, provided that the executive is deemed a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A at the time of termination of service. 
POTENTIAL TERMINATION PAYMENTS UNDER SERVICE AGREEMENTS—DR. NÄHER AND MR. HEYDEN 
Dr. Näher's and Mr. Heyden's existing service agreements and offer letters govern payments made upon death, disability, retirement, or termination. They are also eligible for certain benefits under the Wincor Nixdorf pension plan should their service terminate. 
VOLUNTARY WITHOUT GOOD REASON OR INVOLUNTARY WITH CAUSE 
If the service agreement is terminated by the Company for cause, Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden are generally entitled to base salary earned through the date of termination, along with 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS       
     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MATTERS       
[END TABLE]
 any amounts provided under the Wincor Pension Plan, and shall forfeit any outstanding DN Performance Awards in their entirety. If Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden voluntarily resign without good reason, they are generally entitled to base salary through the date of termination, along with amounts provided under the Wincor Pension Plan, and do not forfeit any outstanding DN Performance Awards. 
INVOLUNTARY WITHOUT CAUSE OR VOLUNTARY WITH GOOD REASON 
Pursuant to their offer letters, Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden participate in our Senior Leadership Severance Plan. If Dr. Näher or Mr. Heyden is involuntarily terminated without cause or he voluntarily terminates his employment for cause or for good reason (as defined in the applicable service and award agreements), he is entitled to the following, in addition to payments under his pension (subject to a general release of claims and acknowledgment of the executive's confidentiality, non-competition and other applicable obligations): 
PAYMENTS MADE UPON RETIREMENT 
Upon retirement, Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden will receive certain benefits under the Wincor Pension Plan pursuant to their service agreements as discussed above in the "Benefits and Prerequisites" section. Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden are entitled to the pension payments upon reaching the age of 60. However, if Dr. Näher or Mr. Heyden remain on the Diebold Nixdorf AG management board in an active capacity beyond this period, the receipt of retirement benefits will be deferred until the end of his service agreement. In the event of retirement, Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden are also entitled to the following: 
PAYMENTS MADE UPON DEATH 
In the event of death, certain beneficiaries of Dr. Näher or Mr. Heyden are entitled to continued payment of his base salary for six months and certain payments under the Wincor Pension Scheme. They are also entitled to the following:

PAYMENTS MADE UPON DISABILITY 
Should Dr. Näher or Mr. Heyden become unable to work due to disability, he is entitled to receive his base salary for a period of up to eighteen months or when he leaves the Company. After eighteen months, the Company may terminate his service agreement and he will receive pension benefits, even if he has not reached the age of 60. Dr. Näher and Mr. Heyden are also entitled to the following:

4   These payments would be subject (in whole or in part) to an excise tax imposed by Section 280G of the Code. In  accordance with the NEO's change in control or employment agreement, we will reduce certain of these payments to the extent necessary so that no portion of the total payment is subject to the excise tax, but only if this results in a better net-of-tax result for the NEO. The calculations in this table do not reflect any such reduction or adjustment.

As discussed above, Dr. Näher's and Mr. Heyden's respective service agreements govern their severance payments. These agreements do not provide change in control protection.

REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee is currently comprised of Patrick W. Allender (Chair), Bruce H. Besanko, Ellen Costello, and Dr. Dieter W. Düsedau. Each member of the committee is independent as defined in the NYSE Listed Company Manual and SEC rules. The primary duties and responsibilities of the committee are (1) to monitor the adequacy of our financial reporting process and systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting and legal compliance, (2) to monitor the independence and performance of our outside auditors and internal audit department, and (3) to provide an avenue of communication among the outside auditors, management, the internal audit department and the Board. The Board has adopted an Audit Committee Charter, which is available on our website at http://www.dieboldnixdorf.com. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with our management and KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, the audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to AS No. 1301 "Communications with Audit Committees," issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB). 
The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding KPMG LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with KPMG LLP its independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services to us by KPMG LLP is compatible with maintaining its independence. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. 
The foregoing report was submitted by the Audit Committee and shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A promulgated by the SEC or Section 18 of the Exchange Act.

SHAREHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS 
Some banks, brokers and other intermediaries engage in the practice of "householding" our proxy statements, annual reports and Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. This means that, if shareholders within the same household request a physical copy of our proxy statement, annual report or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, only one copy may be sent to that household unless the shareholders specifically request to receive multiple copies. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, this Proxy Statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to you if you share an address subject to householding. Please contact our Corporate Secretary at 5995 Mayfair Road, P.O. Box 3077, North Canton, Ohio 44720-8077 or (330) 490-4000 if you wish to receive a separate copy. 
Please contact your bank, broker or other intermediary if you wish to receive individual copies of our proxy materials in the future. Please contact your bank, broker or other intermediary, or our Corporate Secretary as provided above if members of your household are currently receiving individual copies and you would like to receive a single household copy for future meetings. 
EXPENSES OF SOLICITATION 
The cost of soliciting the proxies will be paid by us. In addition to solicitation by mail, some of our directors, officers and employees, without extra compensation, may conduct additional solicitations by telephone, facsimile and personal interviews. We may also enlist, at our own cost, the assistance of banks, bankers and brokerage houses in additional solicitations of proxies and proxy authorizations, particularly from those of their clients or customers whose shares are not registered in the clients' or customers' own names. Brokers, bankers, etc., will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket and reasonable clerical expenses incurred in obtaining instructions from beneficial owners of the common shares. It is estimated that the expense of such special solicitation will be nominal. In addition, Innisfree has been retained to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $20,000. 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
We must receive by November 16, 2019 any proposal of a shareholder intended to be presented at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and to be included in our proxy, notice of meeting and proxy statement related to the 2020 Annual Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Such proposals should be submitted to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
Notice of proposals of shareholders submitted outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act regarding the nominations of directors, which a shareholder intends to present at our 2020 Annual Meeting must be received by us at our principal executive office on or between October 17, 2019 and November 16, 2019 (or, if the 2020 Annual Meeting is held more than 30 days prior to or after April 25, 2020, not later than the close of business on the later of the 180th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual 
 Meeting is first made), or such proposals will be considered untimely under the advance notice provisions of our Code of Regulations. Other non-Rule 14a-8 proposals must be received by us at our principal executive office on or between December 16, 2019 and January 15, 2020 (or, if the 2020 Annual Meeting is held more than 30 days prior to or after April 25, 2020, not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is first made), or such proposals will be considered untimely under the advance notice provisions of our Code of Regulations. 
Non-Rule 14a-8 proposals must comply with certain provisions of our Code of Regulations. Our proxy related to the 2020 Annual Meeting will give discretionary authority to the Proxy Committee to vote with respect to all non-Rule 14a-8 proposals properly brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
OTHER MATTERS 
We are not aware of any matters to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than the matters set forth herein. Should any other matters be presented for a vote of the shareholders, the proxy in the enclosed form confers discretionary voting authority upon the Proxy Committee. In accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, the Board has appointed inspectors of elections to act at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

Such shares may be shares of original issuance or treasury shares or a combination of the foregoing. 
(a)      Common Shares covered by an Award granted under this Plan will not be counted as used unless and until they are actually issued or transferred. 
(b)      If any Award is forfeited, expires, terminates, otherwise lapses or is settled for cash, in whole or in part, without the delivery of Common Shares, then the Common Shares covered by such forfeited, expired, terminated, lapsed or cash-settled Award shall again be available for grant under this Plan. In the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from an Award other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right are satisfied by the tendering of Common Shares (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of Common Shares by the Company, the Common Shares so tendered or withheld shall be added to the Common Shares available for Awards under this Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the following will not again become available for issuance under this Plan: (i) any Common Shares withheld in respect of taxes upon settlement of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (ii) any Common Shares tendered or withheld to pay an Exercise Price, (iii) any Common Shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right that are not issued in connection with its stock settlement on exercise thereof, and (iv) any Common Shares reacquired by the Company on the open market or otherwise using cash proceeds. 
3.2      Share Limits. Notwithstanding anything in this Article III or elsewhere in this Plan to the contrary, and subject to adjustments as provided in Article XI of this Plan, the limits specified below shall apply to any grants of the following types of Awards: 
(a)      Incentive Stock Options. Notwithstanding any designation of an Option as an Incentive Stock Option in an Award Agreement, to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Common Shares with respect to which the Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the portion of the Options falling within such limit shall be Incentive Stock Options and the excess Options shall be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options. For these purposes, Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option was granted. Incentive Stock Options covering no more than 9,091,117 Common Shares may be granted under this Plan. 
(b)      Non-Employee Director Limit. The aggregate dollar value of Awards granted to any non-Employee Director in any calendar year shall not exceed Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000).

3.3      Minimum Vesting Requirements. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, on and after the Effective Date, the Committee shall not award more than five percent (5%) of the aggregate number of Common Shares that become available for grant under this Plan as of the Effective Date pursuant to Awards that are solely subject to vesting conditions or performance periods that are less than one (1) year following the Date of Grant of the applicable Award, subject, in each case, to the Committee's authority under this Plan to vest Awards earlier, as the Committee deems appropriate, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, in the event of a Participant's termination of employment or service or otherwise as permitted by this Plan.

Any Related Right that relates to a Non-qualified Stock Option may be granted at the same time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter but before the exercise or expiration of the Option. Any Related Right that relates to an Incentive Stock Option must be granted at the same time the Incentive Stock Option is granted.

The Committee shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for the Exercise Price, including the method of payment. Consideration may consist of: (a) cash; (b) checks; (c) Common Shares, provided that such Common Shares have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price and provided that accepting the Common Shares does not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company; (d) consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted (or other) cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with this Plan; (e) by net exercise; (f) other consideration and method of payment to the extent permitted by applicable law and approved by the Committee; or (g) any combination of the foregoing methods. 
5.5      Payment. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company an amount equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the Stock Appreciation Right that is being exercised multiplied by the excess of the (i) Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the date the Award is exercised, over (ii) the Exercise Price specified in the Stock Appreciation Right or related Option. The grant shall specify whether the amount payable by the Company on exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be paid in cash, in Common Shares or in any combination thereof and may either grant to the Participant or retain in the Committee the right to elect among those alternatives. Any grant may specify that the amount payable on exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right may not exceed a maximum specified by the Committee at the Date of Grant.

Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards under this Plan such alternative consideration as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all Awards so replaced. In addition, for each Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an Exercise Price greater than the consideration offered in connection with any such transaction or event or Change in Control, the Committee may in its sole discretion elect to cancel such Option or Stock Appreciation Right without any payment to the person holding such Option or Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee may also make or provide for such adjustments in the numbers of shares specified in Section 3.2 of this Plan as the Committee in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, may determine is appropriate to reflect any transaction or event described in this Article XI. 
ARTICLE XII 
TAX WITHHOLDING 
To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any payment made or benefit realized by a Participant or other person under this Plan, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such payment or the realization of such benefit that the Participant or such other person make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld, which arrangements (in the discretion of the Committee) may include relinquishment of a portion of such benefit. Participants shall also make such arrangements as the Company may require for the payment of any withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with the disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of Options. In no event, however, shall the Company accept Common Shares for payment of taxes in excess of required tax withholding rates (or, after the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) dated March, 2016, in excess of maximum applicable tax rates), except that, in the discretion of the Committee, a Participant or such other person may surrender Common Shares owned for more than six (6) months to satisfy any tax obligations resulting from any such transaction. 
ARTICLE XIII 
SUBSIDIARIES AND NON-US JURISDICTIONS 
13.1      Participation by Employees of Designated Subsidiaries. As a condition to the effectiveness of any grant or Award to be made hereunder to a Participant who is an employee of a Designated Subsidiary, whether or not such Participant is also employed by the Company or another Subsidiary, the Committee may require such Designated Subsidiary to agree to transfer to such employee (when, as and if provided for under this Plan and any applicable agreement entered into with any such employee pursuant to this Plan) the Common Shares that would otherwise be delivered by the Company, upon receipt by such Designated Subsidiary of any consideration then otherwise payable by such Participant to the Company. Any such award shall be evidenced by an agreement between the Participant and the Designated Subsidiary, in lieu of the Company, on terms consistent with this Plan and approved by the Committee and such Designated Subsidiary. All such Common Shares so delivered by or to a Designated Subsidiary shall be treated as if they had been delivered by or to the Company for purposes of Article III of this Plan, and all references to the Company in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to such Designated Subsidiary, except for purposes of the definition of "Board" and "Committee" and except in other cases where the context otherwise requires. 
13.2      Employees Outside the US. In order to facilitate the making of any grant or combination of grants under this Plan, the Committee may provide for such special terms for Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary outside of the United States of America as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this Plan. No such special terms, supplements, amendments or restatements, however, shall include any provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the shareholders of the Company. 
ARTICLE XIV 
ADMINISTRATION 
14.1      Delegation to Committee. The Board hereby delegates authority to administer this Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board (or its successor(s)), or any other committee of the Board hereafter designated by the Board to administer this Plan, and the term "Committee" shall apply to any persons to whom such power is delegated. The Committee described in this Section 14.1 may from time to time delegate all or any part of its authority under this Plan to a subcommittee thereof (to the extent of any such delegation, references in this Plan to the Committee will be deemed to be references to such subcommittee). A majority of the Committee (or subcommittee thereof) shall constitute a quorum, and the action of the members of the Committee (or subcommittee thereof) present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or acts unanimously approved in writing, shall be the acts of the Committee (or subcommittee thereof). 
14.2      Committee Requirements. Except as otherwise determined by the Board, the Committee shall consist solely of two (2) or more Non-Employee Directors. The Board shall have discretion to determine whether it intends to comply with the exemption requirements of Section 16b-3 of the Code. However, if the Board intends to satisfy such exemption requirements, with respect to any insider subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Committee shall be a compensation committee of the Board that at all times consists solely of two (2) or more Non-Employee Directors. Within the scope of that authority, the Board or the Committee may delegate to a committee of one (1) or more members of the Board who are not Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Awards to eligible persons who are not then subject to 
 Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Nothing herein shall create an inference that an Award is not validly granted under this Plan in the event Awards are granted under this Plan by a Committee that does not at all times consist solely of two (2) or more Non-Employee Directors. 
14.3      Interpretation. The interpretation and construction by the Committee of any provision of this Plan or of any Award Agreement and any determination by the Committee pursuant to any provision of this Plan or of any such Award Agreement, notification or document shall be final and conclusive. No member of the Board or the Committee shall be liable for any such action or determination made in good faith. 
14.4      Company's Rights Upon Occurrence of Detrimental Activity. Any Award Agreement may provide (whether or not such would result in additional tax to a Participant under Section 409A of the Code) that if a Participant, either during employment by the Company or a Subsidiary or within a specified period after termination of such employment, shall engage in any Detrimental Activity, and the Board shall so find, forthwith upon notice of such finding, the Participant shall, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement: 
(a)      Return to the Company, in exchange for payment by the Company of any amount actually paid therefor by the Participant, all Common Shares that the Participant has not disposed of that were offered pursuant to this Plan within a specified period prior to the date of the commencement of such Detrimental Activity, and 
(b)      With respect to any Common Shares so acquired that the Participant has disposed of, pay to the Company in cash the difference between: (i) any amount actually paid therefor by the Participant pursuant to this Plan, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares on the date of such acquisition. 
To the extent that such amounts are not paid to the Company, the Company may set off the amounts so payable to it against any amounts (but only to the extent that such amount would not be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) that may be owing from time to time by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Participant, whether as wages, deferred compensation or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason. 
14.5      Clawback. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Plan, any Award which is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy adopted by the Company pursuant to any of the foregoing) will be subject to such deductions and clawback as may be required or permitted to be made pursuant to such law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or policy (or pursuant to any other policy adopted by the Company at the direction of the Board, including the Company's current clawback policy). 
14.6      Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Plan and any grants made hereunder comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. This Plan and any grants made hereunder shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent. 
14.7      Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue any fractional Common Shares pursuant to this Plan. The Committee may provide for the elimination of fractions or for the settlement of fractions in cash. 
ARTICLE XV 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
15.1      Amendment or Termination Authority. The Company, by action of the Board (or its designee), may at any time and from time to time amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part. Any amendment which must be approved by the shareholders of the Company in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Common Shares are traded or quoted shall not be effective unless and until such approval has been obtained. Presentation of this Plan or any amendment thereof for shareholder approval shall not be construed to limit the Company's authority to offer similar or dissimilar benefits in plans that do not require shareholder approval. Any amendment or termination of this Plan shall not impair in any material way the rights or obligations of any Participant under any Award that is outstanding as of the effective date of the amendment or termination without the written consent of the Participant. The Committee shall maintain its right to exercise its authority under this Plan with respect to any outstanding Awards at the effective date of termination. 
15.2      Deferrals. Except with respect to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Committee may permit Participants to elect to defer the issuance of Common Shares or the settlement of awards in cash under this Plan pursuant to such rules, procedures or programs as it may establish for purposes of this Plan and which are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Committee also may provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of dividend equivalents or interest on the deferral amounts. 
15.3      Conditions. The Committee may condition the grant of any Award or combination of Awards authorized under this Plan on the surrender or deferral by the Participant of his or her right to receive a cash bonus or other compensation otherwise payable by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Participant. 
15.4      Special Circumstances. If permitted by Section 409A of the Code in case of termination of employment by reason of death, Disability or normal or early retirement, or in the case of hardship or other special circumstances, of a Participant who holds Options or Stock Appreciation Rights not immediately exercisable in full, or any Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock Units as to which the substantial risk of forfeiture or the prohibition or restriction on transfer has not lapsed, or any Performance Shares or Performance Units which have not been fully earned, or Other Share-Based Awards subject to restrictions or conditions, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the time at which such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised, or the time at which such substantial risk of forfeiture or prohibition or restriction on transfer will lapse for Restricted Shares or Restricted Units, or the time at which such Performance Shares or Performance Units will be deemed to have been fully earned, or the time when such restrictions or conditions will terminate with respect to Other or Share-Based Awards, or may waive any other limitation or requirement under any such Award. 
15.5      Change in Exercise Price Prohibited. Except in connection with a corporate transaction or event described in Article XI of this Plan, the terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended to reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an Exercise Price that is less than the Exercise Price of the original Option Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, without shareholder approval. 
15.6      No Right to Continued Employment. This Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor shall it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate such Participant's employment or other service at any time. Prior to exercise of any Option, and prior to exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to any other Award, the Participant may be required, at the Company's request, to certify in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Company that the Participant has not engaged in, and has no present intention to engage in the future in, any Detrimental Activity. 
15.7      Incentive Stock Options. To the extent that any provision of this Plan would prevent any Option that was intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option from qualifying as such, that provision shall be null and void with respect to such Option. Such provision, however, shall remain in effect for other Options and there shall be no further effect on any provision of this Plan. 
ARTICLE XVI 
GOVERNING LAW 
This Plan and all Awards granted and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.
