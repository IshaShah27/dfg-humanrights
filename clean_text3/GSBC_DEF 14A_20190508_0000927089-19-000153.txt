A proxy statement and proxy card for the Annual Meeting are enclosed. The Annual Meeting         is for the purpose of considering and voting upon the following matters:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.   the election of three directors, each for a term of three years;  
 2.   an advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation;  
 3.   the ratification of the appointment of BKD, LLP as Bancorp's independent registered public                    accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and  
 4.   such other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting, or any adjournments or                    postponements thereof.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the bylaws of Bancorp, the Board of Directors has fixed February 28, 2019 as         the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Only record holders of the common stock of Bancorp as of the close of business on that date will be entitled to vote at the Annual         Meeting, or any adjournments or postponements thereof.
The Board of Directors of Bancorp unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of the nominees named in the accompanying proxy statement, FOR the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation and FOR the ratification of the appointment of the         independent registered public accounting firm.
This year Bancorp is using a Securities and Exchange Commission rule to furnish its         proxy statement, Annual Report and proxy card over the internet to stockholders who own fewer than 500 shares.  This means that these stockholders will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials.  Instead, these stockholders will receive only         a notice containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet.  If you received only this notice by mail and would like to request a printed copy of the proxy materials, the notice contains instructions on how you can do         so.
Stockholders are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting in person. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, please read the accompanying proxy statement and then vote by internet, telephone or mail as           promptly as possible. Voting promptly will help ensure the presence of a quorum and save Bancorp from additional expense in soliciting proxies.

PROXY STATEMENTFORANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERSTO BE HELD ON MAY 8, 2019
Solicitation of Proxies
This proxy statement is being furnished to stockholders of Great Southern Bancorp, Inc.         ("Bancorp," the "Company," "we," "us," "our") in connection with the solicitation by our Board of Directors of proxies to vote our common stock, $.01 par value per share ("Common Stock"), at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting")         to be held at the Great Southern Operations Center, 218 S. Glenstone, Springfield, Missouri, on May 8, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., local time, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof. The Notice of the Annual Meeting, a proxy card and our         Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 accompany this proxy statement. Certain of the information in this proxy statement relates to Great Southern Bank ("Great Southern" or the "Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary         of Bancorp.
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon (i) the         election of three directors of Bancorp, (ii) an advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation (the "Say on Pay Vote") and (iii) the ratification of the appointment of BKD, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the         fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (the "Independent Auditor Proposal").
Regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock owned, it is important that         stockholders be represented by proxy or present in person at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders are requested to vote by internet, telephone or mail as promptly as possible.
A proxy may be revoked by a stockholder at any time prior to its exercise by filing         written notice of revocation with the Secretary of Bancorp at the above address, by delivering to Bancorp, at any time before the Annual Meeting, a duly executed proxy card bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in         person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself have the effect of revoking a properly executed proxy.  If your shares are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must follow the instructions on the         form you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee with respect to revoking your proxy.
The cost of solicitation of proxies and of the Annual Meeting will be borne by Bancorp.         In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may also be solicited personally or by telephone by directors, officers and other employees of Bancorp or Great Southern not specifically engaged or compensated for that purpose. Bancorp         will also, upon request, reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners of the Common Stock.
This year we are using a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rule to furnish our         proxy statement, Annual Report and proxy card over the internet to stockholders who own fewer than 500 shares.  This means that these stockholders will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials.  Instead, these stockholders will receive only         a notice containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet.  If you received only this notice by mail and would like to request a printed copy of the proxy materials, the notice contains instructions on how you can do         so.
The approximate date on which this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are         first being made available to stockholders is March 29, 2019. Voting
Bancorp's Board of Directors has fixed February 28, 2019 as the record date (the         "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting, and any and all adjournments or postponements thereof. Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date are         entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. The total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date was 14,169,382.  These are the only securities of Bancorp entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Each holder of the Common Stock is entitled to cast one vote for each share of Common         Stock held on the Record Date on all matters, except that, pursuant to Section D of Article V of Bancorp's charter, any stockholder that beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Limit") is not entitled         to vote shares in excess of the Limit.
In order for any proposals considered at the Annual Meeting to be approved by         stockholders, a quorum must be present. The holders of a majority of the shares of the Common Stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be         counted for purposes of determining a quorum. Shares in excess of the Limit, however, will not be considered present for purposes of determining a quorum. Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast.  The approvals of the Say on Pay         Vote and the Independent Auditor Proposal each require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter.
With regard to the election of directors, votes may be cast in favor or withheld. Votes         that are withheld and broker non-votes will be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect on the election of directors. With regard to the Say on Pay Vote and the Independent Auditor Proposal, stockholders may vote for or against these         proposals or abstain from voting on these proposals. In determining the percentage of shares that have been affirmatively voted on the Say on Pay Vote and the Independent Auditor Proposal, the affirmative votes will be measured against the         aggregate votes for and against each proposal. Thus, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the Say on Pay Vote or the Independent Auditor Proposal.
All shares of Common Stock represented at the Annual Meeting by proxies solicited         hereunder will be voted in accordance with the specifications made by the stockholders executing the proxies. If a properly executed and unrevoked proxy solicited hereunder does not specify how the shares represented thereby are to be voted, the         shares will be voted FOR the election as directors of the persons named in this proxy statement, FOR the Say on Pay Vote  and FOR the Independent Auditor Proposal, and in accordance with the discretion         of the persons appointed proxy for the shares upon any other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
PROPOSAL I. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors constituting Bancorp's Board of Directors is currently nine.         Bancorp's Board is divided into three classes. The term of office of one class of directors expires each year in rotation so that the class up for election at each annual meeting of stockholders serves for a three-year term. The terms of three of         the present directors are expiring at the Annual Meeting.
Each director elected at the Annual Meeting will hold office for a three-year term         expiring in 2022, or until his or her successor is elected and qualified. We expect that the other directors will continue in office for the remainder of their terms. The nominees for director have indicated that they are willing and able to serve         as director if elected and have consented to being named as nominees in this proxy statement. If the nominees should for any reason become unavailable for election, it is intended that the proxies will be voted for the substitute nominees as shall         be designated by the present Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, unless the proxies direct otherwise.
The principal occupation and business experience for the last five years and certain         other information with respect to each nominee is set forth below. The information concerning the nominees has been furnished by them to us. Nominees to Serve a Three-Year Term Expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting

Board Leadership Structure and Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Leadership Structure.  The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company are currently held by two persons, with Mr. W. Turner serving as Chairman and Mr. J. Turner serving as Chief Executive         Officer. This structure has been in place since 2000, when, as part of a leadership transition, Mr. J. Turner was promoted to Chief Executive Officer and Mr. W. Turner, who had served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 1974, continued as         Chairman in an executive capacity. Although Mr. J. Turner has subsequently assumed increased responsibilities from Mr. W. Turner, the Board believes that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions remains appropriate, as         this allows Mr. J. Turner to better focus on his primary responsibilities of overseeing the implementation of our strategic plans and daily consolidated operations, while allowing Mr. W. Turner to lead the Board in its fundamental role of oversight         of management.
Role in Risk Oversight.  Risk             is inherent with the operation of every financial institution, and how well an institution manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks, including but not limited to credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk,         operational risk, strategic risk, cybersecurity risk and reputation risk. Cybersecurity risk is a key consideration in our operational risk management capabilities. Given the nature of our operations and business, including our reliance on         relationships with various third-party providers in the delivery of financial services, cybersecurity risk may manifest itself through various business activities and channels, and it is thus considered an enterprise-wide risk that is subject to         control and monitoring at various levels of management and oversight by the Board. The Board receives updates on the status of the cybersecurity controls, reports of significant cybersecurity incidents and annual education in this area.
Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face, while the         Board has ultimate responsibility for the oversight of risk management. The Board believes that risk management, including setting appropriate risk limits and monitoring mechanisms, is an integral component and cannot be separated from strategic         planning, annual operating planning, and daily management of the Company. Consistent with this approach as well as based on the belief that certain risks require an oversight focus that a Board committee can better provide, the Board integrated the         oversight of certain risk areas (internal control, financial reporting and compliance; and compensation and incentive programs) with the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, respectively. These committees regularly provide reports of their         activities and recommendations to the full Board. The Board directly oversees all other material risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, cybersecurity risk, liquidity and capital adequacy. In support of those activities, members of senior         management regularly attend meetings of the Board to report to the Board on the primary areas of risk facing the Company and to respond to any questions or concerns raised by the directors.
DIRECTORS MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OFTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Meetings of the Board and Committees of the Board
The Board of Directors of Bancorp meets monthly and may have additional special         meetings upon the request of one third of the directors then in office (rounded up to the nearest whole number) or upon the request of the President. The Board of Directors of Bancorp is authorized to appoint various committees and has formed the         Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Stock Option Committee and the Nominating Committee. The Board of Directors of Bancorp has not formed any other committees. The Board of Directors of Bancorp held 16 meetings during fiscal 2018.         During fiscal 2018, each of the directors of Bancorp attended 75% or more of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors of Bancorp and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of         Directors of Bancorp on which the director served, in each case during the period in which he or she served. The Audit Committee is currently comprised of Directors Ausburn, Carlson, Frazier, Hart, Pitt and Steinert.  Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent," as independence for audit committee members is defined in the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock         Market.  The Board of Directors of Bancorp has determined that Director Steinert is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in the SEC's rules.  The Audit Committee held nine meetings during fiscal 2018.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by Bancorp's Board of         Directors, a copy of which is available on our website, at www.greatsouthernbank.com, by clicking "Investor Relations" and then "Corporate Governance." The Audit         Committee is appointed by Bancorp's Board of Directors to provide assistance to the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting processes, the         systems of internal accounting and financial controls, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and         independent registered public accounting firm and any other areas of potential financial risks as may be specified by the Board. The Audit Committee also is responsible for hiring, retaining and terminating Bancorp's independent registered public         accounting firm.

• Based on the review and discussions referred to in the items above, the Audit Committee                    recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

The Compensation Committee operates under a formal written charter, a copy of which is         available on our website, at www.greatsouthernbank.com, by clicking "Investor Relations" and then "Corporate Governance." The members of the Compensation Committee         are "independent directors," as that term is defined in the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. During 2018, the Compensation Committee met three times.
The charter of the Compensation Committee does not specifically provide for delegation         of any of the authorities or responsibilities of the committee. In setting the compensation of executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer.
The Stock Option Committee is currently comprised of Directors Ausburn, Frazier, Hart         and Pitt.  The Stock Option Committee consists solely of independent directors. The Stock Option Committee generally meets at least once per year (usually late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter) to consider stock option grants to         officers and at other times during the year as necessary to consider proposals for the granting of stock options to employees. The Stock Option Committee met five times during 2018.
The current members of the Nominating Committee are Directors Ausburn, Carlson,         Frazier, Hart, Pitt and Steinert.  The Nominating Committee consists solely of independent directors.  The Nominating Committee met two times during 2018.
The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending director candidates to serve on the         Board of Directors. Final approval of director nominees is determined by the full Board, based on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee also is responsible for:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommending to the Board the appropriate size of the Board and assist in identifying, interviewing and recruiting                  candidates for the Board;  
• recommending candidates (including incumbents) for election and appointment to the Board of Directors, subject to the                  provisions set forth in Bancorp's charter and bylaws relating to the nomination or appointment of directors, based on the following criteria: business experience, education, integrity and reputation, independence, conflicts of interest,                  diversity, age, number of other directorships and commitments (including charitable organizations), tenure on the Board, attendance at Board and committee meetings, stock ownership, specialized knowledge (such as an understanding of                  banking, accounting, marketing, finance, regulation and public policy) and a commitment to Bancorp's communities and shared values, as well as overall experience in the context of the needs of the Board as a whole.  Although we do not have                  a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the Board seeks candidates who further its objective of having a Board that encompasses a broad range of talents and expertise and that reflects                  a diversity of background, experience and viewpoints;  
[END TABLE]

• reviewing nominations submitted by stockholders, which have been addressed to the Corporate Secretary, and which                    comply with the requirements of Bancorp's charter and bylaws. Nominations from stockholders will be considered and evaluated using the same criteria as all other nominations;  
• annually recommending to the Board committee assignments and committee chairs on all committees of the Board, and                    recommend committee members to fill vacancies on committees as necessary; and  
• performing any other duties or responsibilities expressly delegated to the Committee by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Bancorp's bylaws, nominations for directors by stockholders must be made in         writing and delivered to the Secretary of Bancorp no earlier than 120 days prior to the meeting date and no later than 90 days prior to the meeting date. If, however, less than 100 days' notice of the date of the meeting is given or made to         stockholders by public notice or mail, nominations must be received by Bancorp not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public announcement of         the date of the meeting was first made. In addition to meeting the applicable deadline, nominations must be accompanied by certain information specified in Bancorp's bylaws.
The Nominating Committee operates under a formal written charter, a copy of which is         available on our website, at www.greatsouthernbank.com, by clicking "Investor Relations" and then "Corporate Governance."
Stockholder Communications with Directors
Stockholders may communicate with Bancorp's Board of Directors by writing to: William         V. Turner, Chairman of the Board, Great Southern Bancorp, Inc., 1451 E. Battlefield, Springfield, Missouri 65804.
Board Member Attendance at Annual Stockholder Meetings
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at annual         stockholder meetings, directors are expected to attend these meetings absent extenuating circumstances. Every current director of Bancorp (who was also a director as of last year's annual meeting) attended last year's annual meeting of         stockholders.
Directors' Compensation
For 2018, directors of Bancorp received a monthly fee of $1,000 for each Board meeting         attended, which was the only compensation paid to directors by Bancorp, except for stock options which may be granted in the discretion of the Board of Directors. Directors of Great Southern received a monthly fee of $3,000 for each regular Board         meeting attended. In 2018, the directors of Bancorp and the directors of Great Southern were the same individuals. Ms. Brown, who serves on Great Southern's Compliance Committee, receives a fee of $300 for each meeting of that committee that she         attends. The directors of Bancorp serving on the Audit Committee are paid a fee of $300 per meeting attended, except for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is paid a fee of $350 per meeting attended. The directors of Bancorp and its         subsidiaries are not reimbursed for their costs incurred in attending Board and Board committee meetings. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the compensation earned by         or awarded to each director, who is not also a named executive officer, who served on Bancorp's Board of Directors in 2018. Compensation paid to Messrs. W. and J. Turner for their service as directors is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table         under the "Salary" Column.

 (1)   An option to purchase 2,000 shares of the Company's common stock was awarded during 2018 to each of the non-employee                  directors named in the table.  The amount in the table reflects the grant date fair value of each award determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ("ASC Topic 718") using the                  Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of these awards are included in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in                  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.  As of December 31, 2018, total shares underlying stock options held by such directors were as follows:  Mr. Ausburn – 9,000 shares, Ms. Brown – 9,750                  shares, Mr. Carlson – 11,000 shares, Mr. Frazier – 11,000 shares, Ms. Hart – 9,000 shares, Mr. Pitt – 11,000 shares and Mr. Steinert - 8,500 shares.

Transactions with Certain Related Persons
The charter of the Audit Committee of Bancorp's Board of Directors provides that the         Audit Committee is to review and approve all related party transactions (defined as transactions requiring disclosure under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K) on a regular basis.
Loans to Directors and Executive Officers.  Great Southern, like many financial institutions, has from time to time extended loans to its officers, directors and employees, generally for the financing of their personal         residences, at favorable interest rates. Generally, residential first mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit have been granted at interest rates equal to Great Southern's cost of funds. Residential first mortgage loans are subject to annual         adjustments while home equity lines of credit are subject to monthly adjustments. Other than the interest rate, these loans have been made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms and collateral as those of comparable         transactions prevailing at the time, and, in the opinion of management, do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. All loans by Great Southern to its directors and executive officers are         subject to regulations restricting loans and other transactions with affiliated persons of Great Southern. Great Southern may also grant loans to officers, directors and employees, their related interests and their immediate family members in the         ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons which, in the opinion of management, do not involve more than the         normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.
No directors, executive officers or their affiliates had aggregate indebtedness to         Great Southern on below market rate loans exceeding $120,000, or a combination of outstanding indebtedness to and credit availability from Great Southern exceeding $120,000 at below market rates, at any time since January 1, 2018 except as noted         below.

The estimated average market rates of interest for 2018 as shown in the table above are         based on the interest rate index and margin for each loan that would have been used if Great Southern's cost of funds was not used.  Interest rate reset dates were factored into the index rates used.  The estimated difference in interest from         actual rate amounts to average market rate amounts shown in the table above represent the difference in interest actually paid during 2018 and interest that would have been paid if the estimated market rates of interest for 2018 were charged. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
In this section, we provide an overview and analysis of our compensation programs, the         material compensation policy decisions we have made under those programs, and the material factors that we considered in making those decisions. Following this section, you will find a series of tables containing specific information about         compensation paid or payable to the following individuals, whom we refer to as our "named executive officers":
[BEGIN TABLE]
• William V. Turner, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bancorp and Great Southern;  
• Joseph W. Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bancorp and Great Southern;  
• Rex A. Copeland, Treasurer of Bancorp and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Great Southern;  
• Kevin L. Baker, Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of Great Southern; and  
• John M. Bugh, Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of Great Southern.  
[END TABLE]
The discussion below is intended to help you understand the detailed information         provided in those tables and put that information into context within our overall compensation program.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of Bancorp's Board of Directors, which         consists solely of independent directors, administers our compensation and benefit programs and determines the compensation of our senior management. The Committee is responsible for setting and administering the policies which govern executive         compensation. The Committee has focused its evaluation of executive compensation on operating performance and the creation of stockholder value, with the intent of meeting the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maintain the financial strength, safety and soundness of Bancorp and Great Southern;  
• reward and retain key personnel by compensating them at the middle to upper levels of compensation for comparable                    financial institutions;  
• focus management on long term goals through long-term incentives;  
• provide fair, reasonable and competitive base salaries;  
• provide the opportunity to earn additional compensation if Bancorp's stockholders experience long-term increases in                    the value of Bancorp stock;  
• emphasize long-term stock ownership of Bancorp stock by executive officers; and  
• properly align risk-taking and compensation.  
[END TABLE]
While the primary components of our compensation program have been base salary, annual         incentive bonus and long-term incentives in the form of stock options, the Committee also takes into account the full compensation package provided to the individual, including pension benefits, termination agreements, insurance, perquisites and         other benefits. In structuring Mr. J. Turner's base salary for 2019, the Committee reviewed several surveys of base salaries paid to the chief executive officers of groups of financial institutions comparable to us in size and performance on a         nationwide basis and based in the Midwest region.  Specifically, the Committee considered the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (i)   surveys prepared by S&P Global of the average base salary paid to chief executive officers at banks and thrifts                    with total assets of between $1.0 billion and $5.0 billion (A) on a nationwide basis ($472,572), (B)  for the Midwest region ($452,747) and (C) on a nationwide basis limited to institutions with a return on average equity of 10.00% to                    12.49% ($504,950), with the average of the amounts in (A) – (C) being $476,756;  
 (ii)   a survey prepared by McLagan Aon Hewitt of the base salaries paid to chief executive officers at regional and                    community banks nationwide with total assets between $3.0 billion and $8.0 billion, the average of which was $632,200;  
 (iii)   surveys prepared by Compdata Surveys of the average base salary paid to chief executive officers at banks and other                    financial services organizations nationwide with (A) total assets of between $1.0 billion and $9.9 billion ($538,300), (B) with a total number of full-time equivalent employees of between 1,000 and 4,999 ($783,700), (C) Midwest Region                    ($511,500) and (D) commercial banks ($509,100), with the average of (A) – (D) being $585,650;  
 (iv)   surveys prepared by Crowe of the average base salary paid to chief executive officers at banks                    and other financial services organizations (A) on a nationwide basis ($275,625), (B) with total assets $1.0 billion to $5.0 billion ($454,345) and (C) with headquarters located in a population greater than 100,000 ($332,716), with the                    average of (A) – (C) being $354,229.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. J. Turner's base salary of $368,985 for 2018 and $380,055 for 2019 were below the         average chief executive officer base salary in each of the surveys noted above, except for two of the surveys referenced in item (iv) and the average of the surveys in that item.
Base Salaries
We provide the opportunity for our named executive officers and other executives to         earn a competitive annual base salary. We do so in order to attract and retain an appropriate caliber of talent for the position, and to provide a base wage that is not subject to our performance risk. Our base salary levels reflect a combination         of factors, including competitive pay levels, the executive's experience and tenure, our overall annual strategic plan for salary increases, the executive's individual performance, and changes in responsibility. We review salary levels annually to         recognize these factors. We do not target base salary at any particular percentage of total compensation.
Each of Messrs. W. and J. Turner has an employment agreement with Bancorp. These         agreements provide that the annual base salaries payable to Messrs. W. and J. Turner may be reduced only as part of an overall program, implemented prior to a change in control, applied uniformly and equitably to all members of our senior         management. Since 2005, in recognition of the increased responsibilities assumed by Mr. J. Turner and at Mr. W. Turner's suggestion, Mr. W. Turner's base annual salary has remained at $200,000 and he has waived his right to receive the annual cash         bonus provided for under his employment agreement (discussed below under "-Bonuses").  Mr. J. Turner was paid salary of $368,985 for 2018 and his base salary increased to $380,055 for 2019.  During 2018, Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh were paid         salaries of $334,955, $312,057 and $311,100, respectively.  For 2019, the base salary amounts for Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh increased to $345,004, $321,419 and $320,433, respectively.  In setting the base salaries of the executive officers         other than Mr. W. Turner, the Committee takes into account the responsibilities of the position and the experience level of the individual executive, as well as our financial performance and the size and complexity of our operations.  In         structuring the base salaries for 2019 for Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh, the Committee reviewed surveys of base salaries paid to the chief financial officers and chief credit and lending officers of groups of financial institutions comparable         to us in size and performance on a nationwide basis and based in the Midwest region.
Bonuses 
Under their employment agreements, Messrs. W. and J. Turner are each entitled to         receive annual cash bonuses equal to one-half of one percent of Bancorp's pre-tax earnings.  We believe that this provides an appropriate short-term incentive to increase our earnings, when coupled with the incentives Messrs. W. and J. Turner have         through their substantial stock holdings to increase our earnings over the long term.   Since 2005, Mr.         W. Turner has waived his right to this bonus, with the understanding that Mr. J. Turner's bonus, if any, may be increased by one-fourth of one percent of our pre-tax earnings.  The Compensation Committee approved this arrangement in recognition of         the additional responsibilities that Mr. J. Turner had assumed from Mr. W. Turner, and the fact that it would at the same time reduce by 25% the total cost to the Company for bonuses, if any, under the employment agreements.  The amount of this         bonus ($527,412 for 2017 and $609,451 for 2018) is included in the Summary Compensation Table below under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column.
Under our 2018 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, each of the named executive officers other         than Messrs. W. and J. Turner (Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh) could earn a cash bonus of up to 15.75% of base annual salary, with up to one-half of this bonus based on the achievement of targeted earnings per share and up to one-half of this         bonus based on individual performance.  Bonuses paid to the participating named executive officers under our 2018 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan are included in the Summary Compensation Table below under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"         column. Because, as noted above, their bonus arrangements are set forth in previously negotiated employment agreements, Messrs. W. Turner and J. Turner do not participate in our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan and therefore are not subject to a cap on         their bonus as a percentage of base salary.
The earnings per share component was based on actual quarterly earnings per share         relative to targeted quarterly earnings per share, with each quarter receiving an equal weighting in determining that component.  For the quarterly periods during 2018, the targeted and actual levels of earnings per share were as follows:
First Quarter 2018
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Targeted EPS     Percentage received for EPS component  
 $0.78     50%  
   0.83     75%  
   0.87     100%  
   0.91     110%  
[END TABLE]
Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 calculated in accordance with         accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") were $0.95.  No adjustment during this quarter was warranted, so this amount was used as the actual earnings per share for purposes of the bonus plan.
Second Quarter 2018
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Targeted EPS     Percentage received for EPS component  
 $0.85     50%  
   0.89     75%  
   0.94     100%  
   0.99     110%  
[END TABLE]
Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2018 calculated in accordance with GAAP         were $0.97.  No adjustment during this quarter was warranted, so this amount was used as the actual earnings per share for purposes of the bonus plan.
Third Quarter 2018
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Targeted EPS     Percentage received for EPS component  
 $0.85     50%  
   0.89     75%  
   0.94     100%  
   0.99     110%  
[END TABLE]
 Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2018 calculated in accordance with GAAP         were $1.57.  The actual earnings per share used for purposes of the bonus plan was an adjusted (non-GAAP) measure of earnings per share of $1.18, which reflected non-operational activity during the quarter resulting in an adjustment of $0.39 per         share due to a net gain associated with the sale transaction during the quarter of Great Southern Bank's branches and related deposits in Omaha, Neb.
Fourth Quarter 2018
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Targeted EPS     Percentage received for EPS component  
 $0.86     50%  
   0.91     75%  
   0.96     100%  
   1.01     110%  
[END TABLE]
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 calculated in accordance with GAAP         were $1.21.  The actual earnings per share used for purposes of the bonus plan was an adjusted (non-GAAP) measure of earnings per share of $1.19, which reflected non-operational activity during the quarter resulting in an adjustment of $0.02 per         share due to interest income recognized related to an interest rate swap, net of one-time fees paid to advisors on the swap transaction.
For the individual performance component of the bonuses paid to the named executive         officers who participated in the 2018 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (Rex A. Copeland, Kevin L. Baker and John M. Bugh), the factors considered included the following accomplishments during 2018 attributable to the efforts of these officers, in         addition to recognition of their contributions to the Company's normal, day-to-day operations: Mr. Copeland – the successful negotiation of the sale of the Company's branches and deposits in the Omaha, Neb. market; Mr. Baker – the size and         complexity of the Company's loan portfolio in light of competitive market conditions, the level of new commercial loan origination volume and the overall level of credit quality of the portfolio; Mr. Bugh – the maintenance of growth in the size of         the Company's loan portfolio in light of competitive market conditions, the level of new commercial loan origination volume, including the successful opening of new commercial loan production offices, and the overall level of credit quality of the         portfolio. It was determined that Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh each earned 93.3% of the individual performance component.
Stock Options 
Stock options have been an integral part of our executive compensation program. They         are intended to encourage ownership and retention of Bancorp's stock by key employees as well as non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Through stock options, the objective of aligning key employees' long-term interests with those of         stockholders may be met by providing key employees with the opportunity to build, through the achievement of corporate goals, a meaningful stake in Bancorp. In fiscal 2018, Bancorp's stockholders approved the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Upon         approval of the 2018 plan by stockholders, Bancorp's Board of Directors froze the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, which means that no new grants of awards will be made under that plan, but outstanding awards under the plan were not affected. The Stock         Option Committee considers additional options each year as needed to attract and retain employees. These grants typically have been made late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of each year, though the Stock Option Committee         retains discretion to grant options at any time during the year. Our senior management group provides recommendations to the Committee for option grants for rank and file employees. Mr. J. Turner provides recommendations to the Committee for grants         to members of the senior management group other than himself. All options granted by the Committee are subject to ratification by the Board of Directors, which typically occurs on the same day as the Committee approval. We do not coordinate the         timing of stock option grants with the release of material non-public information.   Option grants made during 2018 to the named executive officers are included in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.
As required by plan, stock options have an exercise price that is equal to no less than         the market value of Bancorp's common stock on the date of grant, which is the date on which the Board of Directors ratifies the approval of the grant by the Stock Option Committee.  To provide an incentive for a sustained increase in the value of         our common stock, stock options granted to employees typically do not begin vesting until the second anniversary of the grant date, with 25% of the option vesting on that second anniversary date and 25% vesting on         each anniversary date thereafter through the fifth anniversary date.
The 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of stock options, stock         appreciation rights and restricted stock awards, as well as restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units.  Although no incentives other than stock options have been granted to date under the 2018 plan, the Committee and the         Board may consider the utilization of other types of permitted incentive awards in the future.
Retirement and Other Benefits
We participate in a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan covering all employees         who have met minimum service requirements. Effective July 1, 2006, this plan was closed to new participants. Employees already in the plan will continue to accrue benefits. For information regarding benefits payable under this plan to the named         executive officers, see "Pension Benefits."
We have a defined contribution retirement plan covering substantially all of our         employees. During 2018, we matched 100% of the employee's contribution on the first 3% of the employee's compensation, and also matched 50% of the employee's contribution on the next 2% of the employee's compensation. Our matching contributions for         2018 under this plan to the named executive officers are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under the "All Other Compensation" column.
In addition to the basic term life insurance coverage maintained for nearly all         employees (providing a maximum death benefit of $60,000), Great Southern maintains supplemental life insurance coverage for all personnel with an "officer" designation, which provides an additional death benefit of $175,000. Each named executive         officer has supplemental life insurance coverage of $175,000, other than Mr. W. Turner whose coverage has been age-adjusted to $87,500, and each named executive officer other than Mr. W. Turner (who does not have the basic term life insurance         benefit) has the maximum coverage ($60,000) under the basic term life insurance benefit. Premiums paid on behalf of the named executive officers are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under the "All Other Compensation" column. As part of         its health insurance coverage, Great Southern also provides long-term disability coverage to all employees generally. Each of the named executive officers other than Mr. W. Turner (who does not participate in Great Southern's health insurance plan)         is entitled to the maximum long-term disability benefit of $10,000 per month.
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits
We provide the named executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits         that we and the Committee believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and         other personal benefits provided to the named executive officers.
Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Each of Messrs. W. and J. Turner has an employment agreement with Bancorp that provides         for certain payments and benefits if their employment is terminated under certain scenarios, including, but not limited to, within the 12 months preceding, at the time of or within 24 months after a change in control.  See "Employment Agreements."          These employment agreements thus require a "double trigger" in order for any payments or benefits under the agreements to be provided to Messrs. W. or J. Turner in connection with or following a change in control - in other words, both a change in         control and an involuntary termination of employment (which includes a voluntary termination by the executive following a material reduction in his duties, responsibilities or benefits) must occur. The purpose of providing the change in control         payments and benefits is to attract and retain top level executives of the highest caliber and mitigate the risk to these executives that their employment will be involuntarily terminated in the event we are acquired. At the same time, the mere         sale of our company will not automatically trigger a payout, as our intention is to induce the executive to remain employed following a change in control so long as the acquiring company so desires without a material reduction in the executive's         duties, responsibilities or benefits. Each of the employment agreements with Messrs. W. and J. Turner contains a tax gross up provision which provides generally that if the executive receives payments or benefits in connection with a change in control, then         to the extent such payments or benefits constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, he generally will be paid an additional amount (referred to as a "gross up payment") that will offset, on an after tax         basis, the effect of any excise tax consequently imposed on him under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The effects of Section 4999 generally are unpredictable and can have widely divergent and unexpected effects based on an executive's         personal compensation history. Therefore, to provide an equal level of benefit without regard to the effects of the excise tax, we determined that Section 4999 gross up payments are appropriate for Messrs. W. and J. Turner.
We do not have employment or severance agreements with any of our other named executive         officers. To mitigate the risk of loss of benefits to these officers if a change in control occurs, their unvested stock options (like the unvested stock options of all other employees) will vest in full upon a change in control.
Stockholder "Say on Pay" Vote
We are required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act         (the "Dodd-Frank Act") to include a non-binding, advisory "say on pay" vote in our annual meeting proxy statement at least once every three years, and, at least once every six years, a non-binding, advisory vote on the frequency of future say on         pay votes (commonly referred to as a "say on pay frequency vote"), with stockholders having the choice of every year, every two years or every three years.   We included a "say on pay frequency vote" at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, on         which stockholders cast the most votes in favor of a frequency of every year for future say on pay votes.  At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders approved the compensation of the Company's executives, as disclosed in the Company's         proxy statement for that meeting, with approximately 96% of the votes cast in favor. 
Tax Considerations 
As in effect during 2017 and prior years, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code         of 1986, as amended, generally eliminated the deductibility of compensation over $1 million paid to the principal executive officer and certain highly compensated executive officers of publicly held corporations, excluding certain qualified         performance-based compensation.  Stock options, which are the only form of equity-based award currently provided to our executive officers, automatically constituted qualified performance-based compensation, provided that certain plan content and         grant procedure requirements were met.  Effective for 2018 and future years, H.R. 1, originally known as the "Tax Cut and Jobs Act," amended Section 162(m) to provide that qualified performance-based compensation will be subject to the $1 million         deduction limit, subject to grandfathering of amounts payable under certain agreements in effect on November 2, 2017.
Role of Executive Officers in Determining Compensation
Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. J. Turner, makes recommendations to the Committee         regarding compensation for executive officers other than himself.  These recommendations are taken under advisement by the Committee, which may decide to provide compensation in amounts greater or lesser than the amounts recommended by Mr. J.         Turner. For 2018, the compensation paid to the executive officers other than Mr. J. Turner was generally consistent with Mr. J. Turner's recommendations.  Mr. J. Turner is not involved with any aspect of determining his own compensation; nor is his         sister, Ms. Turner Brown.  Mr. W. Turner is not involved with any aspect of the determining the compensation of Mr. J. Turner, other than waiving Mr. W. Turner's right to receive a bonus under Mr. W. Turner's employment agreement with the         understanding that Mr. J. Turner's bonus, if any, may be increased by one-fourth of one percent of our pre-tax earnings.  See "—Bonuses."
Director compensation is determined by the Company's Board of Directors.  Other than         Mr. W. Turner and Mr. J. Turner acting in their capacity as Board members, none of the Company's executive officers has any role in determining the amount of director compensation. Summary Compensation Table

_______________
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   For Messrs. W. and J. Turner, the 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounts in the table include directors' fees of $48,000, $48,000                  and $42,000, respectively.  
 (2)   Represents the grant date fair value of the award determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718 using the Black-Scholes                  option-pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of these awards are included in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual                  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.  
 (3)   Represents incentive bonus awards earned for the years shown in the table. Mr. Bugh's incentive bonus award for 2017 also                  included $7,625 earned under a separate commercial lending bonus plan prior to becoming an executive officer.  
 (4)   Represents the changes during the years shown in the table in the actuarial present value of the named executive                  officer's accumulated benefit under Great Southern's multi-employer defined benefit pension plan. The assumptions used for this calculation were the same as those used for the calculation of the present value of accumulated benefit in the                  table under "Pension Benefits."  For 2018, the actual change in pension value was $(53,000) for Mr. J. Turner and $(16,000) for Mr. Copeland.  The negative amounts for Messrs. J. Turner and Copeland are reflected as zero in the table per                  SEC rules. Mr. Bugh is not eligible for this benefit.  
 (5)   For Messrs. W. Turner, J. Turner, Copeland and Bugh, the 2018 amounts in the table include the aggregate incremental cost                  to Bancorp of certain perquisites and other personal benefits provided to them, comprised of the following: for Mr. W. Turner, personal use of company vehicle, the payment of club dues, personal use of company aircraft and use of tickets to                  various local sporting events; Mr. J. Turner, personal use of company aircraft, the payment of club dues, payments of the costs of executive physicals, and use of tickets to various local sporting events; Mr. Copeland, the payment of club                  dues, personal use of company aircraft, fitness center benefit and use of tickets to various local sporting events; and for Mr. Bugh, the payment of club dues and use of tickets to various local sporting events.  SEC rules require that each                  perquisite or other personal benefit provided to a named executive officer that exceeds the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of perquisites and other personal benefits for that officer be quantified.  The only such perquisites                  or other personal benefits provided to named executive officers during 2018 that are required to be quantified are the personal use of a company vehicle by Mr. W. Turner ($49,335) and the payment of club dues for Mr. Bugh ($30,555).  For                  Mr. Baker, the aggregate incremental cost to Bancorp of the perquisites and other personal benefits provided to him during 2018 was less than $10,000; in accordance with the rules of the SEC, the amounts of these perquisites and other                  personal benefits are not included in the table. For Messrs. W. Turner, J. Turner, Copeland and Bugh, the amounts in the table for 2018 also include, and for Mr. Baker, the amounts in the table for 2018 are comprised of, the

 Pension Benefits
Great Southern participates in the Pentegra Financial Institutions Retirement Fund, a         multi-employer comprehensive defined benefit pension plan. Effective July 1, 2006, this plan was closed to new participants. Employees already in the plan as of that date generally will continue to accrue benefits. Mr. W. Turner is no longer         accruing additional benefits under the plan. A participant becomes fully vested after five years of service or upon attaining age 65 regardless of the number of years of service. The annual benefit for normal retirement (after attaining age 65) is         calculated as follows:
[(2% x years of service prior to 7/1/06 x "high-five average         salary" through 6/30/06) – (1% x years of service prior to 7/1/06 x "high-five average salary" through 6/30/06)] + (1% x years of service before and after 7/1/06 x "high-five average salary" before and after 7/1/06) = annual benefit
The "high-five average salary" refers to the participant's average annual salary for         the five consecutive years of highest salary. A participant retiring with 30 years of service (15 prior to 07/01/06 and 15 after 07/01/06) and a high-five average salary of $40,000 ($30,000 prior to July 1, 2006) would receive an annual benefit of         $16,500 computed as ((2% x 15 x $30,000) – (1% x 15 x $30,000) + (1% x 30 x $40,000)); $9,000 – $4,500 + $12,000 = $16,500.
A participant becomes eligible for early retirement at age 45, in which case the         benefit, otherwise payable beginning at age 65, is reduced by applying an early retirement factor based on his or her age when payments begin. The factor is determined by subtracting the following from 100%: 6% for each year between age 60 and 65,         4% for each year between age 55 and 60 and 3% for each year between age 45 and 55. If payments were to begin at age 55, the early retirement factor would be 50%. A participant taking early retirement at age 55 with 18 years of service and a         high-five average salary of $90,000 prior to July 1, 2006 and 12 years of service after July 1, 2006 and a high-five average salary of $100,000 ($90,000 before July 1, 2006) receives an annual benefit of $23,100 computed as (((2% x 18 x $90,000) -         (1% x 18 x $90,000) + (1% x 30 x $100,000)) x 50%). Each of Messrs. J. Turner, Copeland and Baker are currently eligible for early retirement under the pension plan.
The regular form of retirement benefit (whether normal or early) is guaranteed for the         life of the participant, but not less than 120 monthly installments. If a retired participant dies before receiving 120 monthly installments, his or her beneficiary would be entitled to the present value of the unpaid installments in a lump sum (or         in installments, at the election of the participant or his or her beneficiary). If a participant dies in active service after having become vested, his or her beneficiary is entitled to a lump sum death benefit equal to the present value of 120         monthly retirement benefit installments which would have been payable had the participant's retirement benefits commenced on the first day of the month after the month in which he or she died.
The benefit under the pension plan is subject to Internal Revenue Service annual         compensation limits (generally $275,000 for 2018 and $280,000 for 2019). The following table sets forth information regarding benefits payable to the named         executive officers under the pension plan.

Employment Agreements
Effective October 1, 2002, Messrs. W. and J. Turner (the "Employees") entered into new         employment agreements with Bancorp (the "Employment Agreements").  Each Employment Agreement is for a five-year term and provides for an extension of one year, in addition to the then-remaining term under the agreement, on each October 1st, as long         as (1) Bancorp has not notified the Employee at least 90 days in advance that the term will not be extended further and (2) the Employee has not received an unsatisfactory performance review by the Board of Directors of Bancorp or Great Southern.         Pursuant to the most recent extensions, the term of each Employment Agreement ends September 30, 2022.  The Employment Agreements provide for annual base salaries as determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee of the Board of         Directors, subject to reduction only as part of an overall program, implemented prior to a change in control (as defined in the Employment Agreements), applied uniformly and equitably to all members of senior management. The Employment Agreements         also provide for participation in benefit plans and the receipt of fringe benefits to the same extent as the other executive officers of Bancorp and Great Southern and equitable participation in any performance-based and discretionary bonuses         awarded to the executive officers of Bancorp and Great Southern. In addition, each Employee is entitled to an annual bonus equal to one-half of one percent of Bancorp's pre-tax earnings for the year; for every year since 2005, Mr. W. Turner has         waived his right to receive this bonus.
Each Employment Agreement provides that if the Employee's employment is involuntarily         terminated, then during the remaining term of the agreement he will be entitled to receive (1) on a monthly basis, 1/12th of his annual salary and 1/12th of the average annual amount of cash bonus and cash incentive compensation for the two full         fiscal years preceding the date of termination, subject to reduction by the amount of the Employee's earned income from personal services during the applicable payout period; (2) substantially the same life and disability insurance coverage and         health and dental benefits as he and his dependents and beneficiaries would have received if he had remained employed, subject to reduction to the extent he receives equivalent or better benefits from another employer (the "Post-Employment Group         Health, Life and Disability Insurance Benefits"); and (3) if the involuntary termination occurs within the 12 months preceding, at the time of, or within 24 months after a change in control of Bancorp, a lump sum amount in cash equal to 299% of the         Employee's "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code).
The term "involuntary termination" is defined as termination of the Employee's         employment by Bancorp or Great Southern (other than for cause, or due to death, disability or a prohibition by law from participating in the conduct of the affairs of a depository institution) without the Employee's consent or by the Employee         following a material reduction of or interference with his duties, responsibilities or benefits without his consent. Each Employment Agreement provides that to the extent the Employee receives any amounts or benefits, whether under the Employment         Agreement or otherwise, that will constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and subject him to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue         Code, he will be paid an additional amount that will offset the effect of any such excise tax.
Each Employment Agreement also provides that if the Employee dies while employed under         the Employment Agreement, his estate or designated beneficiary will receive (1) the salary the Employee would have earned if he had remained employed through the 180th day after the date of his death; (2) the amounts of any benefits or awards which         were earned with respect to the fiscal year in which the Employee died and the amount of any bonus or incentive compensation for that fiscal year, pro-rated in accordance with the portion of the fiscal year elapsed prior to his death; and (3) any         unpaid deferred amounts described in the next paragraph.
Each Employment Agreement provides that to the extent the Employee's total compensation         for any taxable year exceeds the greater of $1,000,000 or the maximum amount of compensation deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the greater of these two amounts referred to below as the "maximum allowable         amount"), the excess amount must be deferred, with interest (at an annual rate equal to the Federal short-term rate under Section 1274(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, determined as of the last day of the calendar year in which the Employee's         compensation is first not deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code) compounded annually, to a taxable year in which the amount to be paid to the Employee in that year (including deferred amounts and interest) does not exceed the         maximum allowable amount.
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment
Messrs. W. and J. Turner. The following tables summarize the approximate value of the termination payments and benefits that Messrs. W. and J. Turner would have received if their employment had been terminated on December 31, 2018         under the circumstances shown.  The tables also exclude (i) amounts accrued through December 31, 2018 that would be paid in the normal course of continued employment, such as accrued but unpaid salary and bonus amounts, (ii) vested account balances         under Great Southern's 401(k) plan and (iii) vested account balances under our defined benefit pension plan, as described under "Pension Benefits."

 (1)   Represents the total salary and bonus continuation payments payable monthly to Mr. W. Turner under his employment                  agreement, as described under "Employment Agreements," for the remaining term of the agreement (i.e., through September 30, 2023, assuming Mr. W. Turner's employment were "involuntarily terminated" (as defined under "Employment Agreements")                  on December 31, 2018). The monthly payment amount would be $16,667. While the employment agreement provides for a reduction in the monthly payment amount to the extent of any income earned from providing services to another company during                  the payout period, the monthly payment amount in the preceding sentence and the total amount of payments shown in the table assumes no such reduction.  
 (2)   Although Mr. W.

Consequently, no such benefits would be provided to him following                  termination of his employment.

 (1)   Represents the total salary and bonus continuation payments payable monthly to Mr. J.

Turner's employment were "involuntarily terminated" (as defined under "Employment Agreements")                  on December 31, 2018). The monthly payment amount would be $72,055. While the employment agreement provides for a reduction in the monthly payment amount to the extent of any income earned from providing services to another company during                  the payout period, the monthly payment amount in the preceding sentence and the total amount of payments shown in the table assumes no such reduction.

Turner's employment were terminated on                  December 31, 2018). Amount shown represents the aggregate share of the premium payments to be made by Bancorp, based on the monthly premium rates in effect on December 31, 2018. While the employment agreement provides for a reduction in                  these benefits to the extent Mr. J.

 (7)   Represents the aggregate death benefits payable under the supplemental life insurance coverage maintained for Mr. J.                  Turner and other officers ($175,000) and the term life insurance coverage maintained for all employees generally ($60,000).  
[END TABLE]
 Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh. None of Messrs. Copeland, Baker or Bugh has an employment or severance agreement with Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries. Each of Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh held unvested stock options as of         December 31, 2018, the vesting of which accelerates upon a change in control of Bancorp or upon a termination of employment due to death or disability. If a change in control of Bancorp had occurred on December 31, 2018, or if their employment had         terminated on that date due to death or disability, the values that would have been realized with respect to the unvested options held by Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh as a result of the accelerated vesting of such options (based on the closing         price of Bancorp's common stock on December 31, 2018 ($46.03) and the exercise prices of the options) are $29,012, $17,269 and $14,742, respectively.  Great Southern maintains supplemental life insurance for Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh, along         with other officers. If Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh were to have died on December 31, 2018, the death benefit payable for each officer under the supplemental life insurance coverage would have been $175,000. This is in addition to the term         life insurance benefit generally available to all employees (which would have provided a death benefit of $60,000 for each of Messrs. Copeland, Baker and Bugh).

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of         Bancorp or any of Bancorp's subsidiaries. None of our executive officers has served on the board of directors or the compensation committee of any other entity that had an executive officer serving on Bancorp's Board of Directors or on the         Compensation Committee of Bancorp's Board of Directors.
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010         and the SEC's implementing rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the compensation of our President and CEO, Joseph W. Turner, to the compensation of our median employee.  The pay ratio set forth below is a         reasonable estimate determined in a manner consistent with the SEC's rules.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our median employee was $29,371;  
• the annual total compensation of our President and CEO was $1,145,553; and  
• the ratio of the annual total compensation of our President and CEO to the annual total compensation of our median                    employee was 39 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
To identify our median employee, as well as to determine the annual total compensation         of our median employee and our President and CEO, we took the following steps: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the "median employee," we compared the amount of total cash earnings (base salary, bonus, paid time off                    and any other cash payments) during the year ended December 31, 2017 for each employee (other than our President and CEO) included in our payroll records as of December 31, 2017.  Earnings were annualized for those employees who were not                    employed for the full year.  Because there was an even number of employees in the population, we designated the employee with the lower level of compensation between the two middlemost employees as the median employee. We are using the                    same "median employee" for 2018 as we used for 2017 because there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure and because the                    "median employee" identified is in the same position in 2018.  
• Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the applicable elements of such employee's compensation                    for 2018 in accordance with the SEC's rules for reporting compensation in the Summary Compensation Table, and used the amount that would be reportable in the "Total" column of that table as such employee's annual total compensation.  
• With respect to the annual total compensation of our President and CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total"                    column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL II.  ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We are required, like most other publicly held companies, to include a non-binding vote         to approve the compensation of our executives in our proxy statement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the SEC's implementing rules, commonly known as a "say on pay" vote.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that we include a say on pay vote in our         annual meeting proxy statement at least once every three years, and that at least once every six years we hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the frequency of future say on pay votes (commonly referred to as a "say on pay frequency vote"), with         stockholders having the choice of every year, every two years or every three years. We last held a say on pay frequency vote at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, and the most votes were received for a frequency of every year.  Our Board of         Directors determined, in light of those results, that we will include a say on pay vote in our annual meeting proxy materials every year until the next required say on pay frequency vote is held (in 2024).
The say on pay proposal at the Annual Meeting gives stockholders the opportunity to         endorse or not endorse the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.  The proposal will be presented at the Annual Meeting as a resolution in substantially the following form:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as         disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the annual meeting pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved.
This vote will not be binding on Bancorp's Board of Directors and may not be construed         as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.  Nor will it affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive.  The Compensation Committee and the Board may, however, take into account         the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
The purpose of our compensation policies and procedures is to attract and retain         experienced, highly qualified executives critical to our long-term success and enhancement of stockholder value.  The Board of Directors believes that our compensation policies and procedures achieve this objective, and therefore recommends that         stockholders vote FOR this proposal. PROPOSAL III. RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OFTHE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee of Bancorp's Board of Directors has engaged the independent         registered public accounting firm of BKD, LLP to audit Bancorp's financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year, subject to the ratification of the appointment by Bancorp's stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Representatives of BKD, LLP are expected         to attend the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if they so desire.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, BKD, LLP provided various         audit, audit related and non-audit services to Bancorp. Set forth below are the aggregate fees billed for these services:
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition to the deadline and other requirements referred to above for submitting a         stockholder proposal to be included in Bancorp's proxy materials for its next annual meeting of stockholders, Bancorp's bylaws require a separate notification to be made in order for a stockholder proposal to be eligible for presentation at the         meeting, regardless of whether the proposal is included in Bancorp's proxy materials for the meeting.

OTHER MATTERS
The Board of Directors knows of no business that will be presented for consideration at         the Annual Meeting other than the proposals discussed in this proxy statement. If, however, other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the holders of the proxies to vote the shares represented thereby on         such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by Bancorp. Bancorp will reimburse         brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the Common Stock. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and other         employees of Bancorp and/or Great Southern may solicit proxies personally or by telephone without additional compensation.
