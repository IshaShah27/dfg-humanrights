Since 2016, we have increased the portion of long-term incentives delivered in performance share units (PSUs) - 25% PSUs for 2016, 50% for 2017 and 65% for 2018 (based on grant date value at target); We did not grant stock options in 2018 - see page 36

All of our employees, including the NEOs, are prohibited from entering into any hedging, pledging or derivative transactions in our stock 
Our equity incentive plan prohibits the repricing or exchange of stock options without shareholder approval

The mailing address of our principal executive offices is Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 121 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, MA 02210. We will begin mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to shareholders on March 26, 2019. We will make arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares and will reimburse them for their expenses in so doing.
Why are we soliciting proxies?
We are furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy to the holders of Alexion's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in connection with the solicitation by our Board of Directors of proxies for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting.
When and where is the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
The 2019 Annual Meeting will be held on Tuesday, May 14, 2019 at the Seaport Hotel, 1 Seaport Lane, Boston, MA 02210 at 5:30 p.m. local time, or at any future date and time following an adjournment or postponement of the meeting.

2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 5 
[END TABLE]
Why did I receive a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" but no proxy materials? 
We are distributing our proxy materials to certain shareholders via the Internet under the "Notice and Access" approach permitted by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. This approach conserves natural resources and reduces our distribution costs, while providing a timely and convenient method of accessing the materials and voting. On March 26, 2019, we will begin mailing a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" to participating shareholders, containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet.
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders?
If you receive more than one Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in different accounts. Please follow the voting instructions on each Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
Can I access the proxy materials on the Internet?
This Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and proxy statement and our 2018 Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com. Instead of receiving future proxy statements and accompanying materials by mail, most shareholders can elect to receive an email that will provide electronic links to them. Opting to receive your proxy materials online will conserve natural resources and will save us the cost of producing documents and mailing them to you, and will also give you an electronic link to the proxy voting site.
How do I vote?
Whether or not you plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, it is important that you vote.
If you own shares in your own name (a record owner), you can vote any one of four ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]

n In Person: You can attend the 2019 Annual Meeting to vote by ballot.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in a brokerage account in your broker's name, you will receive voting instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee that you must follow in order for your shares to be voted. Internet and telephone voting also will be offered to shareholders owning shares through most banks and brokers (if your bank or broker offers Internet or telephone voting, you will need to follow the instructions provided by your bank or broker to vote using the Internet or telephone).
If you vote via the Internet or by telephone, your electronic vote authorizes the named proxies in the same manner as if you signed, dated and returned your proxy card. If you vote via the Internet or by telephone, you should not mail a proxy card.

If you are a record holder on the Record Date for the 2019 Annual Meeting you must vote by telephone, by Internet, by signing, dating and returning a printed proxy card, or by attending the 2019 Annual Meeting.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," your bank, broker or other nominee, as the record holder of the shares, is required to vote those shares in accordance with your instructions. If instructions are not provided, the broker's ability to vote the shares depends on the proposal. Your bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote your shares on "routine" matters, even absent instructions. A broker may not, however, vote on "non-routine" matters without receiving specific voting 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 7 
[END TABLE]
instructions from you. Uninstructed shares whose votes cannot be counted on non-routine matters result in what are commonly referred to as "broker non-votes."
If you are the beneficial owner of your shares of Alexion common stock and do not give your broker voting instructions, your broker (1) will be entitled to vote your shares on the ratification of our independent accounting firm for 2019 and (2) will not be entitled to vote your shares on the election of directors, the advisory vote on 2018 executive compensation, or the shareholder proposal.
We urge you to timely provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee so that your votes may be counted on all of these important matters.
Who solicits proxies and bears the costs of solicitation?
Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by officers, agents and employees of Alexion who may communicate with shareholders, banks, brokerage houses and others by telephone, facsimile, email or in person to request that proxies be furnished. All expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation will be paid for by Alexion.

Proposal No. 1 – Election Of Directors   
[END TABLE]
Ten directors have been nominated for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. In the event any of the nominees are unable to serve as a director, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted for such other candidate, if any, who is nominated by the Board to replace the nominee. All nominees have consented to be named in the proxy statement and have indicated their intent to serve if elected. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable to serve. Pursuant to our By-Laws, Alexion's directors are elected by majority vote in uncontested director elections, such as this one. The voting standard for contested director elections is a plurality standard. The majority voting standard provides that a nominee for director in an uncontested election will be elected to Alexion's Board if the votes cast "for" such nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" such nominee's election. In an uncontested election, an incumbent director nominee who does not receive the required votes for re-election is required to tender his or her resignation and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation. Within 90 days following certification of the election results, the Board will act on the committee's recommendation and publicly disclose the Board's decision regarding the tendered resignation, including the rationale for the decision.
The number of candidates for election as directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting is the same as the number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Therefore, this is an uncontested election and directors will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares present or represented and entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS "PROPOSAL NO. 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS" TO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALEXION AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" EACH NOMINEE.

General Information About The Board Of Directors 
[END TABLE]
Each director nominee, if elected, will serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified. Each officer of the Company serves at the discretion of the Board. Dr. Hantson is party to an employment agreement with Alexion.
The Board seeks independent directors who represent a range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experience and expertise. Directors should possess the attributes necessary to be an effective member of the Board, including the following: personal and professional integrity, high ethical values, sound business judgment, demonstrated exceptional business and professional skills and experience, teamwork and a commitment to the long-term interests of Alexion and its shareholders. In evaluating candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers potential conflicts of interest, diversity, the requirement to maintain a Board that is composed of a majority of independent directors, and the extent to which a candidate would fill a present or anticipated need. In any particular situation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may focus on individuals possessing a particular background, experience or qualifications which the committee believes would be important to enhance the effectiveness of the Board. In early 2019, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  adopted the "Rooney Rule" under which the Committee agreed to include, and have any search firm that it engages include, gender and ethnic diverse candidates in the pool from which the Committee recommends director candidates. 
The current Alexion directors represent a desirable range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experience and expertise. The biography of each director nominee and a description of certain specific experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills of each director that led the Board to conclude that the individual should serve as a director are described below.
To align with Alexion's corporate strategy announced in 2017, the Board undertook a significant refreshment exercise to primarily add directors with biopharmaceutical experience as chief executive officers. The Board has appointed four independent directors since September 2017 with deep industry experience, including three industry veterans and former and current chief executive officers. If all nominees are elected at the annual meeting, the Board will consist of 90% independent directors, with average tenure of approximately 3.4 years.

Each director is individually qualified to make unique and substantial contributions to our Board based upon the experience, knowledge and skills that they have obtained in the course of their extensive careers.

Our Board is a dynamic group, providing an appropriate balance of executive, financial and regulatory knowledge that are necessary for oversight of a global biopharmaceutical company. The lack of a mark in any particular area does not necessarily signify a director's lack of qualification or experience in such area. This blend of qualifications, attributes, tenure and independence results in highly effective leadership and is summarized below.

Meetings and Committees
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held 6 meetings. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and the committees of the Board on which he or she served. Members of the Board of Directors are expected to attend and be present at the annual shareholders meeting and all incumbent directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
The Board of Directors has determined that nine of the ten nominees (Dr. Baker, Mr. Brennan, Mr. Coughlin, Dr. Dunsire, Dr. Friedman, Mr. Mollen, Dr. Nader, Ms. Reinsdorf, and Dr. Rummelt) are "independent directors" as that term is defined under the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Standards and the SEC rules and regulations. Dr. Hantson, a director and our Chief Executive Officer, is the only Board member who is not independent. In 2018, the Board of Directors met in executive session where only the independent directors were present without any members of Alexion's management, including during a majority of the four regularly scheduled meetings.
Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are party to any material proceedings to which any of our directors, officers, affiliates, 5% or more shareholders, or any of their respective associates are a party. We do not believe that any of our directors, officers, affiliates, 5% or more shareholders, or any of their respective associates are adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or have a material interest that is adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.
Our Board of Directors has four standing committees. A description of each standing committee is provided below. Each committee operates pursuant to a charter that has been approved and adopted by our Board of Directors, each of which are reviewed on an annual basis by the applicable committee and the Board of Directors. Each committee charter is posted on our website, www.alexion.com, under the "Corporate Governance" subsection of the "Investors" section. In addition, the Board of Directors reviews the membership of each committee on an annual basis, and more frequently as needed, in order to make sure that the legal and regulatory requirements related to committee composition are complied with and that the appropriate set of skills and viewpoints are being brought to the deliberations and decisions of each committee.

Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
We strive to maintain strong corporate governance practices that protect and enhance accountability for the benefit of Alexion and all of Alexion's shareholders. We regularly review and continually refine our governance practices and policies to align with evolving practices and issues raised by our shareholders and other stakeholders. We believe that our corporate governance structure, with its strong emphasis on Board independence and strong Board and committee involvement, provides sound and robust oversight of management.
Our Board believes that sound governance practices and policies provide an important framework to assist it in fulfilling its duty to shareholders. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and relies on the guidelines to provide that framework. The guidelines are not absolute rules, and can be modified to reflect changes in Alexion's organization or business environment. The Board reviews the guidelines on an annual basis and if necessary, modifies the guidelines to reflect current good governance practices and policies. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board amended the Corporate Governance Guidelines during 2018 to, among other things, provide that a director can only serve on five public company boards of directors (service on the Alexion Board is to be included when making this calculation). The foregoing limitation is consistent with the proxy voting guidelines of a leading proxy advisory firm. Further, this amendment to the Corporate Governance Guidelines provides that the Chief Executive Officer of Alexion should not serve on more than one additional Board of Directors of a public company in addition to the Alexion Board. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all of our directors were in compliance with this "overboarding" policy. 
Alexion's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of the committees of our Board and our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct described below may be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Investors section of our website at www.alexion.com or in print upon written request to ATTN: Investor Relations, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 121 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, MA 02210. 
We believe part of effective corporate governance includes active engagement with our shareholders. We value the views of our shareholders and other stakeholders, and we communicate with them regularly and solicit input on a number of topics such as business strategy, capital allocation, corporate governance, and executive compensation. At the direction of the Board of Directors, we have instituted an on-going shareholder outreach initiative, which has targeted holders of greater than 50% of our outstanding shares, in order to obtain feedback from our shareholders on any issues of importance to them. Among the issues that shareholders have addressed in connection with this outreach are: corporate performance, board composition, compensation, our compliance program, gender and ethnic diversity of the management team and employee base, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts, and environmental and sustainability issues, among others. This input has been valuable and helps to frame discussions with management and the Board. In addition, feedback from shareholders has led to adoption of new practices, for example, we are including disclosure in this proxy statement regarding our CSR initiative which we have recently launched. 
We remain committed to investing time with our shareholders to increase transparency and better understand our shareholder base and their perspectives. 
This section describes key corporate governance facts about our Company and practices that we have adopted.

Process for Selecting Nominees and Shareholder Nominations
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for Board membership recommended by: Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members and other Board members; management; our shareholders; third party search firms; and any other appropriate sources. If a shareholder submits a nominee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate the qualifications of such shareholder nominee using the same selection criteria the committee uses to evaluate other potential nominees. 
Our Bylaws contain provisions addressing the process by which a shareholder may recommend a person for consideration as a nominee for director at an annual meeting. A shareholder must give timely notice of the nomination in proper form, including a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Alexion's Bylaws and timely updates and supplements relating to the nomination. 
Shareholder Nominations Not for Inclusion in Alexion's Proxy Statement. To nominate a director for consideration at an annual meeting, a nominating shareholder must provide the information required by our Bylaws and give timely notice of the nomination to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws. To be timely, assuming the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is not more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting, a shareholder's notice and recommendation must be received no earlier than the close of business on November 27, 2019, and not later than the close of business on December 27, 2019. In addition, to be considered timely, a shareholder's notice must further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in the notice is true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement must be delivered to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not later than five business days after the record date for the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight business days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
Our Bylaws provide that a shareholder's advance notice of a nomination must contain the following information for each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the Board: (1) all information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected, (2) a detailed description of all direct and indirect compensation and other monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the prior three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder and beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert, on the other hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K, (3) a completed and signed questionnaire, provided by the Corporate Secretary upon written request, with respect to the background and qualification of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, and (4) a written representation and agreement, provided by the Corporate Secretary upon written request, that such person (a) is not

[END TABLE]
and will not become a party to (i) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director, will act or vote on any issue or question (a Voting Commitment) that has not been disclosed to Alexion or (ii) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person's ability to comply, if elected as a director, with such person's fiduciary duties under applicable law, (b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than Alexion with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed in accordance with our Bylaws, (c) in such person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director, and will comply, with all applicable corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of Alexion publicly disclosed from time to time, and (d) will abide by the requirements of the director voting provisions of our Bylaws. In addition, we may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by us to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director or that could affect a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
In addition, our Bylaws provide that to be in proper form, a shareholder's notice must set forth, with respect to the shareholder, beneficial owner and their respective affiliate or associate acting in concert, giving notice of the nomination: (1) the name and address of the shareholder, as they appear on our books, or such beneficial owner, if any, and of their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert, (2) (a) the class or series and number of shares of Alexion which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder, beneficial owner and their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert, (b) any "derivative instrument" directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such shareholder, the beneficial owner, if any, or any affiliates or associates or others acting in concert, (c) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such shareholder has a right to vote any class or series of shares of Alexion, (d) any "short interest" involving such shareholder, the beneficial owner, if any, or any affiliates or associates or others acting in concert, (e) any rights to dividends on the shares of Alexion owned beneficially by such shareholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of Alexion, (f) any proportionate interest in shares of Alexion or "derivative instruments" held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such shareholder is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner of such general or limited partnership, (g) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that such shareholder is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of Alexion's shares or "derivative instruments," (h) any significant equity interests or any "derivative instruments" or "short interests" in any principal competitor of Alexion held by such shareholder, and (i) any direct or indirect interest of such shareholder in any contract with Alexion, any affiliate of Alexion or any principal competitor of Alexion, and (3) any other information relating to such shareholder and beneficial owner, if any, that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement and form or proxy or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
You may write to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 121 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, MA 02210, ATTN: Corporate Secretary - to deliver the notices discussed above and for a copy of the relevant Bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for nominating director candidates pursuant to our Bylaws. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 22 
[END TABLE]
Shareholder Nominations Under Proxy Access Bylaw. Our Bylaws provide that under certain circumstances, a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, who have maintained continuous ownership of at least three percent of our common stock for at least three years, may nominate and include a specified number of director nominees in our annual meeting proxy statement. Please refer to Proposal 4 (below), pursuant to which a shareholder has submitted a proposal for consideration of the shareholders at the Annual Meeting requesting that the Board amend the following proxy access provisions as contained in Alexion's By-laws. 
The number of shareholder-nominated candidates appearing in our annual meeting proxy statement cannot exceed the greater of 20% of the number of directors then serving on the Board and two directors. If 20% is not a whole number, the maximum number of shareholder-nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. The following persons will be considered shareholder-nominated candidates and counted against the 20% maximum: (i) shareholder-nominated candidates that the Board determines to include in the Company's proxy materials as Board-nominated candidates, (ii) any shareholder-nominated candidate that is subsequently withdrawn, and (iii) any director who had been a shareholder-nominated candidate at any of the two preceding annual meetings of shareholders and whose reelection at the upcoming annual meeting is being recommended by the Board. Nominating shareholders are required to provide a list of their proposed nominees in rank order. If the number of shareholder-nominated candidates exceeds 20%, the highest ranking qualified individual from the list proposed by each nominating shareholder, beginning with the nominating shareholder with the largest qualifying ownership and proceeding through the list of nominating shareholders in descending order of qualifying ownership, will be selected for inclusion in the Company proxy materials until the maximum number is reached. If the maximum number of shareholder-nominated candidates is not reached after the highest ranking qualified individual has been selected, this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached. 
The nominating shareholder or group of shareholders also must deliver the information required by our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws.
Requests to include shareholder-nominated candidates in the Company's proxy materials must be received no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days before the anniversary of the date that we issued our proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders. However, if no annual meeting of shareholders was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days before or later than the first anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders, we must receive the request not later than the close of business on the earlier of (i) the 60th day prior to the date we issue our proxy statement in connection with such annual meeting of shareholders or (2) the 10th day after public announcement of the date of such annual meeting of shareholders is first made. The nominating shareholder or group of shareholders also must deliver the information required by our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws. 
Nominating shareholders are permitted to include in the proxy statement a 500-word statement in support of their nominee(s). The Company may omit any information or statement that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
Director Criteria, Qualifications and Experience; Diversity
We are committed to diversified Board membership and we seek nominees who represent a range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experience and expertise, both within and outside our industry. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates candidates identified from a number of 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 23 
[END TABLE]
sources and reviews Board composition regularly. The Board expects each of our directors to have personal and professional integrity, high ethical values, sound business judgment, demonstrated exceptional business and professional skills and experience, teamwork and a commitment to the long-term interests of Alexion and its shareholders. In evaluating candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers potential conflicts of interest, diversity, the requirement to maintain a Board that is composed of a majority of independent directors, and the extent to which a candidate would fill a present or anticipated need. In any particular situation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may focus on individuals possessing a particular background, experience or qualifications which the committee believes would be important to enhance the effectiveness of our Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for advising our Board on diversity, including gender, ethnic background, country of citizenship and professional experience and it seeks to recommend diverse nominees for the Board. The committee assesses the effectiveness of its responsibilities concerning diversity at least once each year, and takes action as warranted. Our Board is diverse, and our nominees reflect a Board of diverse gender, age, skills, experiences and points of view. Our Board believes that diversity enhances the overall effectiveness of our Board by presenting different perspectives inside the boardroom and to management, and we encourage diversity within all levels of our global organization. Accordingly, in early 2019, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee agreed to include, and have any search firm that it engages include, gender and ethnic diverse candidates in the pool from which the Committee selects director candidates (this provision is commonly referred to as the "Rooney Rule"). Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not maintain any additional formal diversity policies, the committee considers diversity in making its determinations. 
Board Refreshment and Evaluations
We have been deliberate in our approach to succession planning and Board refreshment. In 2017 and 2018, we appointed four additional independent directors. Eight of the Board's nine independent directors have tenure of less than five years on the Board. The appointments in 2017 and 2018 bring significant biopharmaceutical experience to the Board, including three current or former chief executives. The Board believes that its current composition aligns with the Company's re-focused strategy announced in 2017. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board are committed to maximizing Board effectiveness, which requires periodic assessments and regular dialogue, both during and outside of meetings. 
Regular evaluations are an important tool in determining continued tenure. The Chair of our Board and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees an annual assessment of the effectiveness of each Committee and the Board. Our Board and each Committee complete written evaluations to evaluate its own performance on an annual basis. Directors discuss the results of these evaluations during Committee meetings and in executive sessions of the Board. Our directors have demonstrated their willingness to refresh the Board and to conduct open and honest evaluations of its performance.
Board Leadership Structure
We have chosen to separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Board believes that separating the roles is the most appropriate structure for Alexion. The Board believes that an independent chairman enables the Board to more effectively and objectively monitor the performance of Alexion, the CEO and management. By separating the positions, the Board believes that 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 24 
[END TABLE]
Dr. Hantson can devote his attention to executing the Company's strategy while Mr. Brennan can take responsibility for leading the Board.
In his role as the independent chairman, Mr. Brennan undertakes several responsibilities with respect to the operations and functioning of the Board.  Among these responsibilities are the following: presides at meetings of the Board and shareholder meetings; calls meetings of the Board and executive sessions (and presides over executive sessions of the Board of the non-employee directors) and has the authority to call a meeting of the non-employee directors at any time; establishes and approves the annual work plan, agenda and schedule for each of our Board meetings; leads the annual Board and Committee assessment process ; serves as a liaison for shareholder communications with our Board;  leads the process for evaluating our Chief Executive Officer and undertakes such other responsibilities as the Board may assign to him from time to time.
By appointment of the Board, Mr. Brennan has served as the independent Chairman of the Board since May 2017. The Board's existing leadership and Board structure enable strong independent oversight, and the Board has been significantly refreshed, as described above. From Alexion's inception in 1992 until October 2014, Alexion had an independent Chairman and separated the positions of Chairman and CEO. In October 2014, Alexion's then current CEO, Dr. Leonard Bell, Alexion's principal founder and CEO from 1992 - 2015, assumed the role of Chairman immediately following the sudden death of the Board's then serving Chairman. At the same time as Dr. Bell's appointment to Chairman, the Board appointed a lead independent director. Dr. Bell retired as CEO in April 2015 and again the roles of CEO and Chairman were separate. Dr. Bell retired from the Board in May 2017 and since such time, Alexion has again had an independent Chairman. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing Alexion's risk management processes including effective oversight of management. Management has the responsibility to identify, assess and manage the various risks that we face. At the management level, risks are prioritized and assigned to senior leaders based on the risk's relationship to the leader's business area and focus. Those senior leaders develop plans to address the risks and measure the progress of risk management efforts. The Board and each committee of the Board oversee material company risks within their areas of general oversight, as described above under "General Information About the Board of Directors." Pursuant to the terms of its charter, the Audit and Finance Committee evaluates management's processes for identifying, assessing, reviewing, refreshing and modifying its enterprise risk management system and processes, and reviews with management and external advisors the identification, prioritization and management of risks, the accountabilities and roles of the company functions involved with enterprise risk management, the risk portfolio and the corresponding actions implemented by management. In addition, at the request of the Board, the full Board also reviews and considers, on an annual basis or more frequently as the situation may require, the Company's enterprise risk management function, its findings on risks that the Company faces in its operations and the proposed remediation plans that have been put forward by management. The standing committees of the Board regularly inform the full Board of Alexion's most significant risks and how these risks are managed.
The Board believes it is important to align Alexion's strategic priorities with the Company's risk management program. The Board executes its oversight and decision-making responsibilities as the Company's strategic priorities and risks evolve with the business and external conditions. Alexion is 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 25 
[END TABLE]
committed to fostering a company culture of risk-adjusted decision-making without constraining reasonable risk-taking and innovation.
Board's Role in Strategy
The Board oversees that management has established and periodically re-evaluates a corporate strategic plan. Our strategic planning process is dynamic and evolves throughout any given year, culminating in a review and approval of the proposed plan by the full Board at least annually. Following approval of the strategic plan, the Board regularly receives updates from management concerning implementation of the plan. The Science and Innovation Committee also reviews on a regular basis the scientific and medical aspects of specific proposed transactions or opportunities, and supports and advises management as it deems appropriate. The Board is regularly informed of factors affecting our implementation of our strategic plan, including our performance and progress against the plan, enterprise risks, and the impact of industry and global developments. 
Succession Planning
An important responsibility of the Board and the CEO is to ensure long term continuity of leadership. Our senior executives discuss future candidates for leadership positions at all levels within Alexion's global organization. The Board and its committees review and discuss leadership succession plans, leadership development and organizational capabilities across all functions of the Company. We consider succession planning to be an important factor in managing the long-term planning and success of our business.
Diversity at Alexion
Alexion is committed to gender and ethnic diversity within all ranks of our organization. This is evidenced in the composition of the executive team at Alexion, which consists of nine members and five of those (more than one-half of the executive team) are female. The members of the executive team represent different ethnicities. The commitment to diversity extends even further into our organization where, much like the executive team, approximately half of our employees are female and also represent a number of ethnicities and backgrounds. As we have significantly re-aligned our business focus and expanded our product pipeline, we have undertaken meaningful hiring efforts and these efforts are designed to bring in the best candidates in the biopharmaceutical industry that have diverse backgrounds and experiences that we believe can enhance our short and long-term performance. This focus on diversity is also apparent in our Board, where the two most recent additions were females, Deborah Dunsire and Judith Reinsdorf, and where we have adopted the "Rooney Rule" pursuant to which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee agreed to include, and have any search firm that it engages include, gender and ethnic diverse candidates in the pool from which the Committee selects director candidates. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at Alexion supports our mission to transform the lives of people affected by rare and devastating diseases while creating value for all our stakeholders. We aspire to be a leader in this space by viewing CSR though the lens of "Shared Value," the concept that companies can help solve social issues while creating financial value for its shareholders.
CSR Board Oversight: In 2017, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assumed responsibility for oversight of the development of and recommendation to the Board of policies and management systems for environmental, health, safety and social responsibility matters. We believe this commitment by the Board of Directors will allow for a sustainable, long-term CSR program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
CSR Steering Committee: Alexion's CSR Steering Committee, which consists of Alexion employees drawn from all levels of our organization, including the Executive Committee, serves as a collaborative, cross-functional task force focused on CSR, its measurement, and shared value efforts at Alexion. This includes setting Alexion's CSR strategy and overseeing strategic CSR positioning, making and advocating critical business actions as it relates to CSR, and advancing CSR leadership, cascading through the organization, all under the oversight of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

LETTER FROM THE LEADERSHIP AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CHAIR
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2018 was a year of transformation for Alexion. We set ambitious goals for 2018, which we exceeded, and, in the majority of cases, far surpassed, through the hard work of our more than 2,600 employees across the globe. As Alexion moves through 2019, we have an exciting future ahead. The Board of Directors, the leadership team and our employees are all committed to deliver value to our patients, and through this, deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Alexion remains focused on becoming the most rewarding Company to work for.
The Committee's pay-for-performance philosophy ties compensation to the achievement of short- and long-term financial, operational and strategic objectives that we believe will ultimately drive value creation for the Company's shareholders. Over the last several years, we have made thoughtful changes and evolved our total rewards programs for our executives and our rank-and-file employees to align to best compensation and governance practices. At the same time, when aligned with the Leadership and Compensation Committee's compensation philosophy, we strive to incorporate shareholder feedback into compensation program design and components. In 2018, we actively reached out to shareholders throughout the year to discuss our business strategy and our pay for performance compensation model. We value the views of our shareholders.
With a fully transitioned management team as of 2018, the Company put forth ambitious goals and these ambitious goals were reflected in the 2018 compensation program. The 2018 compensation objectives were established to measure, among other important goals, strong commercial performance, improved operating margins, receipt of marketing approval of Soliris for the treatment of gMG, and progress advancing the Ultomiris program. At the conclusion of 2018, the Company's performance surpassed these ambitious goals and, in certain cases, even the "stretch" goals that the Committee set for the Company.
As discussed in greater detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, over the last several years, we have made significant improvements to our executive compensation program, focused on aligning incentives with long-term value creation and incorporating best practices.
As we position Alexion for continued success as one of the world's most innovative pharmaceutical companies, we expect our compensation programs to support and reinforce our strategy, secure our talent, and drive shareholder value creation.
Thank you for your support and we look forward to maintaining ongoing dialogue.
Sincerely,
Jack T. Mollen
Chair
The Leadership and Compensation Committee

[END TABLE]
Alexion's executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, incentivize and reward performance. The Leadership and Compensation Committee (for purposes of this CD&A, the "Committee") seeks to deliver competitive compensation to help us retain and motivate our key talent and to recognize our executives for their contributions to Alexion and our patients, and for the value they create for shareholders.
2018 Performance Highlights
2018 was a transformational year for us.  We are proud of what we were able to accomplish and to set the stage for the future of our business. During the last 18 months our organization has gone through significant changes; we have integrated an entirely new executive leadership team, relocated our headquarters from New Haven, Connecticut to Boston, Massachusetts, hired over 1,000 new employees

(which equals approximately one-third of our workforce), and shifted our strategy from an ultra-rare disease to a rare disease focused company to broaden and diversify the patient populations we serve, all in a manner that we believe positions us for continued growth as we advance our mission of delivering innovative therapies to patients with rare diseases. Our renewed organization is dedicated to building and maintaining a high integrity culture centered around our patients. 
Our 2018 performance demonstrated our ability to execute on our objectives, achieve excellent financial results, and advance and rebuild our pipeline. These key objectives served as the foundation around which the 2018 executive compensation program and components were designed.
Early in 2018, we identified five key objectives that would define our performance for the year. We established these objectives as the benchmark against which the management team would measure the Company's success. These objectives were communicated to our shareholders and we provided updates on our progress relative to these objectives on a quarterly basis. We set ambitious goals for 2018, which we exceeded, and, in the majority of cases, far surpassed. These key objectives, and our achievements in 2018 relating to these key objectives, are summarized below.

The achievement of these results was reflected in the 2018 financial performance. For example, we generated record net product sales in 2018 for Alexion. In addition, the compound annual growth rate for our net product sales from the period of 2016 to 2018 was 15.77%. The chart below shows our year-over-year revenue growth since 2016.

While the Alexion management team is very pleased to report the achievement of these 2018 financial and strategic goals to our shareholders, we are most proud of the manner in which these goals were achieved, which we believe reflects our culture of acting with integrity and with a focus on compliance. We believe this foundation of compliance and integrity will carry us forward to achieve our 2019 objectives and create shareholder value, which has been reflected so far in 2019 by an approximate 40% year-to-date stock price increase through March 15, 2019 (the record date for the 2019 Annual Meeting). 
2018 Say-On-Pay Vote and Shareholder Engagement
The Committee and the Board carefully consider shareholder feedback, regarding the overall operation of our business, including with respect to our executive compensation program. Members of our Board participate in our investor outreach initiatives and our investor engagement team, including our Chair of the Board, Chair of the Leadership and Compensation Committee, Head of Investor Relations, Corporate Counsel, and Head of Total Rewards, regularly interact with our shareholders throughout the year on many topics. Through these interactions, we gather and consider feedback from our shareholders on strategic, operational, governance and executive compensation matters.  Specifically, in connection with our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we had extensive communications with our shareholders that addressed, among other items: (i) reviews of the governance improvements to our compensation programs; (ii) the increased use of performance as the foundation on which the components of the compensation program rests and (iii) the rationale for the pay-out amounts under our programs.  We generally received positive  responses from our shareholders on the compensation program.  The following details the extent of this shareholder engagement.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Shareholder Engagement During 2018
At the direction of the Board, this shareholder outreach continued after the 2018 Annual Meeting and throughout 2018 and into 2019 (the post-2018 Annual Meeting engagement included an outreach to shareholders holding approximately 60% of our common stock). These on-going discussions with our investors focus on issues of importance to our shareholder base, including our compensation programs. We are also able to tell the story of our business and management team, as 2018 represents the first full year our management team has been together. 
Our 2018 financial and operational performance exceeded expectations for the Company and the goals established by the Committee early in 2018, which were, even at target levels, demanding and required meaningful improvement over prior years (which prior years had already reflected solid performance). This 2018 achievement is reflected in the Committee's 2018 final performance compensation determinations. The Committee is focused on retaining and motivating a talented and experienced CEO and management team that the Committee and the Board believes can lead Alexion and create long-term shareholder value. Our communications with investors on executive compensation matters has emphasized our compensation roadmap with the progression from more subjective to more quantitative measurement for our annual cash incentive bonus plan (AIP) and our long-term equity incentive (LTI), as well as ensuring appropriate rigor and governance to plan design.
The Committee also carefully considers the views of the leading proxy advisory firms on the compensation peer group we have established. As discussed in greater detail under "Peer Group Selection Criteria", the Committee strives to select companies that are of similar size (based on revenues, market capitalization, and number of employees), are organized like Alexion, operate in similar geographic and business areas (i.e., companies with a global presence and rare/orphan disease focus) and competes for the same talent. While the Committee endeavors to select peer companies that exhibit all these criteria, it recognizes that it cannot develop a peer group in which all companies satisfy all criteria. The Committee specifically noted the discrepancy between the Company's selected peer group and those selected by a leading proxy advisory firm, in particular with respect to the inclusion of a generic pharmaceutical company (where results are not driven by innovation and expanding new product pipelines with new technologies) and an animal health organization (that operates under a different model and regulatory regime) by one of the proxy advisory firms.  Alexion does not compete with these types of entities for employees or talent. After extensive consideration, the Committee determined that companies in the proxy advisory peer group 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 34 
[END TABLE]
do not represent an appropriate comparator group because the nature, size and scale of the business, regulatory regime, market demands and influences, and employee and investor perception of these companies are all fundamentally different from Alexion. As a result, the Committee did not make significant changes to our peer group during 2018.
Our shareholders' feedback and input informs the Committee's continuous assessment of the compensation program components and program design and these ongoing discussions with shareholders have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the evolution of Alexion's executive compensation program. As noted above, the feedback from shareholders acknowledged the alignment of our executives' pay with our overall performance and generally expressed support for our executive compensation program. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, approximately 79% of the votes cast on the advisory vote on executive compensation were in favor of Alexion's 2017 compensation for our named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Changes to our program in 2018 reflect the Committee's adoption of compensation best practices and, input from independent compensation consultants and proxy advisory firms, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reducing the subjective component of our AIP;  
• Increasing the performance share unit component of our LTI (with a corresponding decrease in equity awards that are tied solely to time-based vesting);  
• Implementing three-year cliff performance and vesting periods for our performance share units (and also diversifying the performance metrics associated with these awards by replacing non-GAAP EPS with non-GAAP Operating Margin); and 
• Further reducing the maximum number of shares that can be earned in respect of performance share units.  
[END TABLE]
In connection with our shareholder outreach after the 2018 Annual Meeting, there has been an expression of positive support for these changes and our compensation program and philosophy. In 2019, we plan to maintain a compensation program that has components and overall plan design that incorporates best practice feedback from shareholders and from our independent compensation consultant.
Executive Compensation Framework and Philosophy
Compensation Program Roadmap 
Over the last several years, we have made significant changes to our executive compensation program, which we believe better align this program with our pay-for-performance philosophy, align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders, and are consistent with good corporate governance and best practices. These changes are summarized in the table below.

The pay-for-performance ethos is reflected within both our short-term (one-year) and long-term (three-year) compensation programs.  In addition, a component of the long-term compensation is directly tied to total shareholder return (or TSR), an important performance metric for our shareholders.  In general, we believe the mix of short- and long- term variable compensation components provides appropriate incentives to motivate near-term performance, while at the same time providing significant incentives to keep our executives focused on making future-oriented business, strategic and operational decisions that are intended to drive long-term corporate benefits that drive shareholder value (and not exclusively on quarterly or annual performance).
The charts below set forth the targeted total direct compensation mix for Dr. Hantson and the other NEOs for 2018. Targeted total direct compensation is calculated as the sum of: base salary, the AIP bonus at 100% of target and the proposed equity values of restricted stock units (RSUs) and PSUs granted to the individuals in 2018. Proposed equity value of the PSUs assumes that the performance metrics are met at 100% of target. Importantly, in 2018: (i) 92% of the CEO's targeted total direct compensation was performance-based compensation, and on average, 83% of our other named executive officers' targeted total direct compensation was performance-based compensation and (ii) 82% of the CEO's targeted total direct compensation and, on average, 71% of the targeted total direct compensation for our other named executive officers was in the form of equity which, as a significant component of overall total compensation, closely aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of our shareholders.

those of our shareholders and drive shareholder value, pay competitive compensation with a balance between cash and equity-based and short- and long-term compensation and provide programs that are balanced and internally consistent. The Committee considers and approves compensation programs based on the Committee's executive compensation philosophies, which include the following:

2018 Compensation Components and Key Compensation Actions
The primary elements of our executive compensation program and a summary of the actions taken by the Committee with respect to the 2018 compensation of our NEOs are set forth in the following table and are also described in further detail below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Component Link to Business and Talent Strategies 2018 Compensation Actions 
Base Salary  Competitive base salaries help attract and retain executive talent. Base salaries are reviewed annually against survey and peer market data and recommendations are made based on position relative to market and performance. In 2018, only two of our currently employed NEOs received an increase in base salary (3%) based on market positioning and the fact that executives were still relatively new in their roles. Dr. Hantson's base salary was not increased in 2018.   
Annual Cash Incentive  Compensation  Focus executives on achieving annual financial and strategic results. Measure NEO performance against pre-established Company performance goals. Our annual cash incentive program is based on financial and strategic performance goals that are set annually. Performance is assessed annually by management and approved by the Committee. For 2018, we based 65% of our AIP payout on financial metrics including Revenue, Operating Margin, non-GAAP EPS and Free Cash Flow, and 35% of our goals based on strategic objectives. Our 2018 performance exceeded all of our AIP objectives and goals and corporate achievement was 174% of target. After taking into account their superior individual performance leading our organizational changes, our NEOs each received a bonus payout equal to 200% of target.  
Long-Term Equity  Incentive Compensation  Annual equity-based awards consist of PSUs (65%) and RSUs (35%). Provide a direct link to the creation of shareholder value and execution of our business plan. Our Long Term Incentive program has evolved to a program that grants 65% of the annual award in the form of PSUs and 35% in the form of RSUs (assuming target performance for PSUs). PSUs granted in 2018 are based on three-year achievement of Revenue and non-GAAP Operating Margin financial milestones and vest three years from the date of grant if the performance metrics are met, generally subject to continued employment. The shares issuable under the PSUs can be increased or decreased based on our relative total shareholder return. The PSU goals are those that the Committee has identified as key indicators of Company performance and creation of shareholder value. Additionally, because R&D is integral to building our pipeline, we provide an opportunity for additional PSUs to be earned based on long-term value creation milestones linked to R&D objectives. RSUs granted in 2018 vest over four years, with RSUs vesting in equal annual installments. RSUs provide focus on stock price growth and serve our talent retention objectives.     
[END TABLE]
2018 Compensation Decisions for Named Executive Officers
As further described below, the Committee approved 2018 (i) base salaries, (ii) annual cash incentive targets, and (iii) LTI awards, including PSUs and RSUs, in February 2018 for each of the NEOs.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 39 
[END TABLE]
Base Salaries
Base salary represents a secure, fixed component of an executive's compensation. Determinations of base salary levels for our executives are established based on the position, scope of responsibilities, and prior relevant background, training and experience of each individual. Base salaries are evaluated annually for possible merit or other increases and take into account the Committee's annual review of the marketplace competitiveness of our NEOs' base salaries as compared to the peer group and survey data provided by our independent compensation consultant. The Committee believes that the 2018 base salary increases approved for two of our NEOs are consistent with market levels and appropriately reflect individual contributions of these NEOs.
The Committee did not increase the 2018 base salaries for Dr. Hantson, Mr. Clancy, or Ms. Law. Mr. Goff and Dr. Orloff each received a 3% increase in base salary in 2018 to better align their salaries with the market, as well as to reward them for their individual contributions in 2017.

[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Incentive Awards 
For each of the NEOs, the Committee established annual cash incentive targets as a percentage of base salary for 2018.
We pay annual cash incentive awards to drive the achievement of strong annual performance. The Committee endeavors to deliver a meaningful portion of total cash compensation in the form of performance-based annual cash incentives. The Committee believes that doing so is critical because the opportunity for a meaningful cash award will, together with strong management and accountability, drive executives to individually and collectively achieve and exceed Alexion's annual objectives.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 40 
[END TABLE]
The Committee established annual cash incentive targets as a percentage of base salary for each of the NEOs for 2018 as follows. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Cash Incentive Target Changes CEO 2018 Target (as a percentage of Base Salary) 2017 Target (as a percentage of Base Salary) 
Ludwig Hantson 120% 120%

Paul Clancy 70% 70% 
Brian Goff 70% 70% 
Anne-Marie Law 70% 70% 
John Orloff 70% 70% 
[END TABLE]
Under the annual cash incentive plan, no bonus is payable if the applicable threshold performance goal is not achieved (thereby providing no cash incentive if the minimum targets established by the Committee with respect to a performance criterion is not achieved). 50% of target is payable if threshold performance is achieved with respect to a performance criterion and a maximum of 200% of target is payable for achieving the highest level of performance with respect to such criterion.
The performance goals for the 2018 AIP were based on four financial metrics representing 65% of the performance goals and strategic imperatives representing 35% of such goals, with an individual performance modifier that could result in an increase or decrease to the AIP payout for an individual based on individual performance. The measures and weightings for all components, including the strategic imperatives, of the 2018 AIP were established at the beginning of the year. We exceeded each of our financial metrics, resulting in a performance score of 169% for the financial component of the AIP (as described in the table below). The strategic performance metrics for the 2018 AIP were focused on improving certain core aspects of Alexion's business. The goals were detailed and granular, and structured to drive performance to achieve specific milestones that had been identified as integral to Alexion's operations. The Committee established the financial and strategic targets and milestones that were deemed challenging at the time they were put in place and the Committee concluded that achievement of the targets would require exceptional performance from each of the NEOs and the entire management team (and to further incentivize our NEOs, the Committee established maximum or "stretch" goals that were considered to be much more demanding). The Committee also believed that these objectives required exceptional cross-functional performance and execution to achieve by a management team that was only recently appointed. 
The 2018 AIP strategic goals specifically related to a combination of: rebuilding our pipeline, transforming patient lives, business development transactions and building our culture to make Alexion the most rewarding Company to work for. The Company not only met the strategic targets that the Committee had established, but in many cases the performance reflected satisfaction of the even more stringent and demanding maximum or stretch performance goals. This achievement resulted in a performance score of 183% for the strategic component of our AIP. 
The weighted average results between the financial and strategic goals of the AIP resulted in a total performance score of 174% of target.

In establishing the 2018 financial performance metrics, the Committee took into account the 2017 metrics as well as 2017 performance and established challenging, yet achievable, 2018 goals that required meaningful improvement over 2017 performance. For example, the two common financial metrics that were included in both the 2017 and 2018 AIP were Net Product Revenue and Non-GAAP EPS, and the target set for 2018 represented an increase of 12% and 32%, respectively, from the Company's 2017 actual results. Further, the Committee put these challenging, yet achievable, goals in place during a year in which the management team was establishing itself and implementing its vision for Alexion, moving its corporate headquarters, implementing a comprehensive company-wide transformation plan to enhance and remediate its business processes, structures, controls, training, talent and systems across Alexion's global operations, hiring a significant number of new employees and aggressively pursuing Ultomiris approval for PNH and preparing for product launch.

When taking into account individual performance of our NEOs during 2018, the overall funding for annual cash incentives was determined to be 200% of target (financial and strategic performance of 174%, plus an increase for exceptional individual performance of 26%).The individual achievements of the NEOs are described below (See our 2018 Performance Highlights for additional details). The 2018 bonus was calculated as follows:

[END TABLE]
As noted above, the bonuses for the NEOs were increased by an additional 26% of target pursuant to the 2018 AIP to recognize their superior individual performance and role in driving our significant organizational changes in 2018. In 2017, the Committee established a policy on bonus payouts under the AIP that capped the aggregate payout under the AIP to 200% of target, and in accordance with that cap, the Committee limited the bonus payout to 200% of target under the 2018 AIP for the NEOs.
Our CEO, Ludwig Hantson, led the new chapter in Alexion's development. Dr. Hantson implemented a material shift in our strategy from a focus on ultra-rare disease to rare disease; assembled a management team that has, in a short time, improved our financial performance, developed an enhanced product pipeline and is developing a top-tier compliance program; moved our headquarters to Boston to elevate our talent pool and be a contributor  to the Boston biotech hub; contributed to our improved workplace culture by establishing an appropriate the "tone-at-the-top" that focuses on and values compliance and integrity in all of Alexion's work; and spear-headed a global sustainable pricing strategy for Ultomiris. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Clancy, drove sustained strong financial results including double-digit revenue growth and over 700 basis points of margin expansion and led the execution of four strategic business development deals (which was unprecedented in our history). 
Our Chief Scientific Officer, John Orloff, significantly contributed to our three positive Phase 3 read outs in 2018 as well as supported business development deals and the earlier than expected approval of Ultomiris by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Our Chief Commercial Officer, Brian Goff, built out a new therapeutic area for his commercial team in Neurology; led the gMG launch, which was the most successful launch in Alexion's history; and, with our head of compliance, transformed our sales force to focus on ethics, compliance and integrity. 
Our Chief Patient & Employee Experience Officer, Anne-Marie Law, supported the transformation of the Company by contributing to over 1,000 new hires (more than one-third of the total organization); partnered with the Head of Culture to support an over 30% improvement in culture survey results and formed a new initiative to connect patient focus and employee experience to how we run our business.

Long-Term Incentive Awards
The Committee believes that LTIs are a critical element of compensation that provides a mechanism to align shareholder's interests with leadership, and promotes behaviors consistent with Alexion's strategic plan and financial goals. Each LTI award is a variable component of compensation and no individual, including any NEO, is guaranteed to receive an award or any value in respect of his or her awards. The Committee believes that its practice of granting LTI awards to Alexion executives is critical to driving long-term successful performance.
The Committee has not established formal guidelines for LTI award grants to our executives, including our NEOs. In determining LTI awards for executives, the Committee considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Peer group market data; 
• The individual's historic contributions and potential contributions to Alexion's growth and financial results; 
• Value of proposed awards; 
• Corporate performance; and  
• The individual's level of responsibility within Alexion. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee has established a compensation approval process such that all components of compensation are approved at the same time early each year. By taking a holistic view to each of the cash component of compensation (base salary and annual bonus) and the equity component of compensation, the Committee ensures that an executive's total compensation is consistent with the Committee's overall philosophy and objectives. 
In February 2018, the Committee approved LTI awards in a combination of PSUs (which constituted 65% of the aggregate LTI value, assuming target performance, at the date of grant) and RSUs (which constituted 35% of the aggregate LTI value at the date of grant). The Committee approved LTI awards for the NEOs in the amounts set forth below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Share Units 65% + Restricted Stock Units 35% = Long Term Incentive Award 
[END TABLE]
We have an established annual LTI grant practice in which LTI grants are made following the completion of the selection of our peer group and our internal performance reviews of our executive officers, as well as a review of the external market equity practices (including the data from our peer group and the F.W. Cook survey and market data described below). The Committee approves the annual LTI grants in February of each year following our annual earnings release. In accordance with our equity grant policy, the NEOs LTI awards are granted on the last day of February (and the number of shares subject to the LTI awards are determined based upon the closing stock price on that date). Other grants, such as those made in connection with a new hire, are generally granted on the first trading day of the month following the date of hire.
RSUs vest over four years in equal annual installments. PSU awards are subject to a variety of performance criteria (as described below). PSUs awarded to our NEOs in February 2018 are earned, if the applicable three-year performance criteria are satisfied, and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. 
As noted above, the Committee believes the mix of equity awards issued to our NEOs in 2018 provides a mechanism to align management with shareholder interests while supporting our talent retention objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 45 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSUs inherently incentivize shareholder value creation, since PSUs will only be earned based on Alexion's operational, TSR and R&D performance. 
• RSUs align pay and Company performance as reflected in our share price. RSUs are more likely to support the Committee's talent retention objectives. 
[END TABLE]
As noted in the Executive Summary above, 2019 equity awards consist of the same mix of PSUs and RSUs at 65% and 35% of aggregate LTI value, respectively, to ensure continued focus on achievement of key strategic initiatives intended to build long-term shareholder value.
The following tables provide information on the 2018 PSUs and RSUs granted to our NEOs.

We redesigned the PSU component of the LTI program for 2018 and itincluded the following central features:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Operational PSUs are earned based on a three-year performance period with the amount of shares of common stock actually earned by the NEO being dependent upon the achievement of Alexion's Revenue (weighted 40%) and non-GAAP Operating Margin (weighted 60%) targets. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 46 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee, in establishing these long range financial goals, incorporated optimistic assumptions regarding the contribution of future pipeline advancement and commercialization to corporate financial performance (thereby making the satisfaction of these financial metrics more challenging and dependent upon advances in our product pipeline). In order to achieve these targets, the Company must achieve significant growth and demonstrate operational and financial discipline.  
• Threshold performance must be achieved for one or both of the operational PSU metrics (Revenue and non-GAAP Operating Margin) or no operational PSUs will be earned.  
• Earned Operational PSUs can be increased or decreased by up to 20% based on Alexion's three-year relative TSR performance compared to the TSR Peer Group, with an 0.8% increase for each 1% that Alexion's TSR is above the 75th percentile of the Peer Group or a 0.8% decrease for each 1% that Alexion's TSR is below the 25th percentile of the TSR Peer Group. The TSR Peer Group is the collection of companies within the S&P 400 and 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, and Life Sciences Indices, as well as any additional companies in our executive compensation peer group, which the Committee viewed as a relevant and appropriate benchmark. 
• Because R&D is vital for our business growth and pipeline expansion, an additional number of PSUs, up to 60% of the target number of PSUs, can be earned by our NEOs. The R&D PSUs that could be earned have a three-year performance period with the amount actually earned dependent upon satisfaction of specified three-year R&D milestones. For 2018, the Committee selected seven R&D milestones to incentivize executives to achieve aggressive R&D goals relating to our internal and external additions to our pipeline that will expand our product pipeline with the objective to continue to increase and diversify our revenue. The milestones relate to Ultomiris (four regulatory approval milestones and two clinical milestones in a second formulation) and the completion of clinical-stage business development transactions.  
• To the extent earned, all PSUs cliff vest on the date that the Committee determines performance, which will be on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant.

The Committee and management review long term LTI objectives at each Committee meeting to assess long term achievement probability. 
Compensation Governance
Role of Executives in 2018 Compensation Decisions
No NEO participated in discussions about or made recommendations with respect to his or her own compensation.
A small number of executives typically attended Committee meetings, including our CEO, CFO, Chief Patient and Employee Experience Officer and General Counsel.
The CEO, with appropriate staff and management support, worked with the Committee and its independent compensation adviser to develop compensation recommendations for the NEOs other than himself. The CEO discussed his evaluation of the individual performance of the other NEOs. The Committee, however, was responsible for making all decisions regarding the compensation of the other NEOs.
The Committee was responsible for evaluating and determining the CEO's compensation and worked directly with the independent compensation adviser, as discussed below, with appropriate support from Alexion staff. The CEO was not present when the Committee discussed and approved his compensation.
Role of the Leadership and Compensation Committee
In accordance with the Committee's charter, the Committee determines the compensation of Alexion's executive officers and approves and evaluates Alexion's compensation programs. The Committee makes its executive compensation decisions based on many factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 47 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Its review of corporate results against financial and strategic corporate objectives that are established early in the year, assigning a performance score as a percentage of target 
• An annual benchmarking exercise to obtain competitive market information and compare each executive's compensation to that of individuals in similar positions at Alexion's self-selected peer group of companies 
• The CEO's assessment of the performance of his direct reports measured against their objectives 
• The CEO's compensation recommendations for his direct reports 
• The Committee's assessment of the CEO's performance 
[END TABLE]
Role of the Compensation Adviser
According to its charter, the Committee is authorized to engage, retain and terminate consultants to assist it in any aspect of the evaluation of CEO or executive officer compensation, and to approve such consultant's fees and retention terms. The Committee also has authority to obtain advice from internal or external legal and other advisors. In 2018, the Committee retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") to advise the Committee as its independent compensation adviser.
FW Cook provided analysis, research, data, peer and other market information, survey information and program-design experience in evaluating and assisting in the development of Alexion's compensation programs for executives as well as cash and equity incentive program terms. The compensation adviser also kept the Committee informed of market trends and developments. Representatives of FW Cook generally attended meetings of the Committee and communicated with the Chief Patient and Employee Experience Officer and Committee Chairman between meetings. The Committee, however, made all decisions regarding the compensation of our executive officers.
The Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook, taking into account the relevant SEC and NASDAQ independence factors. The Committee believes that FW Cook is independent and that there are no conflicts of interest that would impact the advice the Committee received from the compensation adviser.
Assessing the Competitive Marketplace and Alexion's Peer Group
FW Cook assisted the Committee in its compensation decisions by, among other things, providing market compensation information reflecting the executive compensation practices and levels across similar positions and similar industry companies. FW Cook utilized compensation surveys to assess market information, including compensation surveys prepared by Willis Towers Watson and Radford. In addition, the Committee considered the pay and practices at a peer group of biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry companies when making executive compensation decisions.
How the Peer Group is Used
The Committee uses the peer group data in the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As an input to determine base salary, annual cash incentive targets, awards actually paid and the approximate grant-date value and form of long-term incentive awards; 
• As an input to determine total direct compensation; 
• As an input for designing our executive compensation programs; 
• As an input to develop the form and mix of equity awards; 
• To assess whether Alexion's executive compensation programs are aligned with Company performance; and 
• To assess incentive plan burn rate, overhang and equity expense. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 48 
[END TABLE]
The peer group information is a key reference point for the Committee. The Committee compares the compensation of each NEO to similar positions within the peer group. The Committee also takes into account various factors such as the unique characteristics of the individual's position, and any succession and retention considerations. The Committee, however, does not generally adopt peer group compensation levels as strict boundaries when making its decisions, and will award amounts greater or lower than the peer group as they determine that the circumstances require. The Committee chooses the level of opportunity and the mix of compensation elements to determine total direct compensation opportunities in a way that it believes is appropriate to incentivize exceptional performance in accordance with its overall compensation philosophy and the Board's business goals and strategic objectives.
Peer Group Selection Criteria
The Committee develops the peer group based on the criteria listed below, together with input from its independent compensation adviser. The Committee strives to select companies that are of similar size (based on revenues, market capitalization, and number of employees), are organized like Alexion, and operate within the same markets and industry (i.e., are focused on the innovative development of pharmaceutical products, a global presence and a focus on orphan and rare diseases). The peer group selection criteria are set forth in greater detail in the table below. While the Committee endeavors to select peer companies that satisfy all of the criteria set forth below, it recognizes that it cannot develop a peer group in which all companies satisfy all of these criteria.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Consideration Purpose 
Industry A peer company should operate in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry to appropriately reflect the nature, size, scale and innovation of the business, market demands and influences, and employees and investor perception. After extensive consideration of generic pharmaceutical and animal health companies which are designated as peers by certain proxy advisory firms, the Committee does not believe that companies in those industries represent an appropriate comparator group because the nature, size and innovation required of these businesses, market demands and influences, and employee and investor perception of these companies are all fundamentally different from Alexion.  
Industry A peer company should operate in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry to appropriately reflect the nature, size, scale and innovation of the business, market demands and influences, and employees and investor perception.

Recruiting A peer company should operate in the same industry and should compete with Alexion for talent. 
Annual Revenues Generally, companies in the same industry with similar revenues to Alexion (between 0.3x and 3x Alexion revenues) and are operating businesses of a similar commercial complexity. 
Market Capitalization Generally, companies with market capitalizations in the same industry as Alexion's (between 0.3x and 3x Alexion's market capitalization) and are established, mature businesses that have expected revenue growth and anticipated pipeline achievements. 
Global Presence A peer company should conduct global commercial operations. We look at the percent of revenues attributed to non-U.S. sales and consider companies with worldwide operations. 
Number of Employees The number of individuals employed by a peer company tends to be a reflection of the organization's operational complexity. We target between 1,000 and 9,000 employees. 
Orphan and Rare Disease Focus A peer company should be focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for orphan and rare diseases. 
[END TABLE]
FW Cook and the Committee reviewed the list of companies identified using the above parameters to determine which companies are most similar to Alexion. The lack of similarity of a peer company to Alexion with respect to any single criterion stated above is not by design, but rather because there are not a sufficient number of companies that are similar to Alexion with respect to all criteria. For example, not all companies in Alexion's peer group have a rare disease focus. The Committee believes that it is not 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 49 
[END TABLE]
possible to eliminate differences entirely and recognizes the possibility that shifts in Alexion's peer group selection could influence executive compensation decisions. Additionally, given Alexion's global complexity, success in hiring top industry talent and relatively high market capitalization to revenue ratio, the Committee believes that it would be detrimental to the Company and shareholders to focus primarily on any one factor, such as revenues, when selecting peer companies. 
Peer Group
The Committee and FW Cook analyzed the peer group it used in 2017, evaluating it in light of past and anticipated industry consolidations. The Committee considered each company in the 2017 peer group and 15 additional companies in its review. One company from the existing (or 2017) peer group of 15 was removed due to its acquisition (Medivation, Inc.). The Committee also decided to add one new company, Seattle Genetics, Inc., to better balance the overall size of the peer group. As a result of these changes, the peer group that was used for 2018 compensation decisions included the same number of peers at 15, with all but one reporting revenues outside the U.S. 
Below is the peer group used by the Committee when determining 2018 base salaries, targets for annual cash incentive awards, and LTI awards included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Peer Group Changes Added: Seattle Genetics, Inc. Removed: Medivation, Inc. (Due to M&A Activity)

Allergan plc Gilead Sciences, Inc. Shire plc 
Amgen Inc. Incyte Corporation United Therapeutics Corporation 
Biogen Inc. Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
At the time of the Committee's compensation review leading up to compensation decisions in February 2018, Alexion was, on balance, at approximately the median of the peer group. The barbell nature of our industry necessitates the inclusion of larger peer companies, which are balanced by smaller peers such that our percentile rank is close to the median. Specifically, Alexion was at the 46th percentile for revenue, 38th percentile of market cap, 59th percentile for non-US revenue and 45th percentile for total employees.
While shareholder feedback and support for our executive compensation program are consistently positive, in 2018 we received criticism for the size of certain peer companies from one of the leading proxy advisory firms. As discussed in greater detail in "2018 Say-on-Pay Vote and Shareholder Engagement", the Committee carefully considered this feedback and concluded that the above peer group is an appropriate representation of market compensation levels for Alexion. Most importantly, it reflects companies within our industry and our size generally approximates the median.
Market practices are one of the considerations that the Committee considers when determining executive compensation program design, the components of compensation and the amounts of compensation. The committee does not generally target a specific market percentile or simply replicate the market practice of peer group companies. Instead, the review of the practices of our peer group is utilized as a reference point to assist the Committee in providing programs designed to attract, retain and inspire our executives. The Committee also uses a peer group to provide context for its executive compensation decision-making. Each year, and periodically during the course of the year if the circumstances require, our independent

compensation consultant reviews the external market landscape and evaluates the composition of our peer group for appropriateness.

[END TABLE]
Termination and Change of Control-Based Compensation
We provide severance payments and other benefits to our executives under written employment agreements if their employment is terminated without cause or in certain other instances, including in connection with a change of control. In February 2016, the Committee approved new executive employment agreements, which all of our continuing NEOs are party to, to among other things, eliminate all 280G gross-up provisions and increase cash severance benefits based on market practices. Severance provisions related to a change of control assist in retaining high quality executives and keeping them focused on their responsibilities during any period in which a change of control may be contemplated or pending. We also provide for accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards upon a change of control for awards granted prior to January 1, 2016. In 2016, the Committee eliminated automatic single-trigger equity acceleration upon a change of control. With respect to awards granted in 2016 and thereafter, our executive employment agreements now provide for double-trigger acceleration of vesting only in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following a change of control. More details on the severance payments and benefits our continuing and terminated NEOs are entitled to receive, or have received, are provided under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" below.
Departure of Ms. O'Neill
On June 28, 2018, we announced that Ms. Julie O'Neill, our Executive Vice President, Global Operations, resigned her position and departed from the Company. Alexion made a determination not to hire a new Executive Vice President, Global Operations and, instead, the functions formerly performed by the Executive Vice President, Global Operations were assumed by certain members of Alexion's management team. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 51 
[END TABLE]
In connection with Ms. O'Neill's resignation, the Company and Ms. O'Neill entered into a severance agreement dated as of June 27, 2018 (the Severance Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Severance Agreement, the Company agreed to provide certain benefits to Ms. O'Neill, including the following: (i) three-months of advance notice of termination of employment (which period ended on September 30, 2018) and continued salary and benefits through such three-month period; (ii) cash payments equal to 18-months' salary, or approximately €827,166 (of which €342,709 was contributed to the Company's pension plan for Ms. O'Neill's benefit); (iii) a lump sum cash payment equal to Ms. O'Neill's pro rata cash bonus for 2018, or approximately €297,150; (iv) a lump sum cash payment equal to Ms. O'Neill's full year target cash bonus for 2018, or approximately €396,200; (v) a cash payment of €7,441 in lieu of continued health and dental insurance coverage for the 18-month period following September 30, 2018; (vi) acceleration of vesting of all outstanding stock options and time-based restricted share unit awards (including earned PSUs (none of the PSUs granted in 2018 were accelerated pursuant to this agreement)) that were unvested as of September 30, 2018 and an extended exercise period for vested stock options (to 180 days following Ms. O'Neill's termination of employment); and (vii) tax preparation and reimbursement assistance for income earned from the Company during calendar year 2018. In addition, Ms. O'Neill was entitled to receive outplacement services for a period of five months following her termination of employment with a value of up to €8,500. In order to receive the foregoing benefits, Ms. O'Neill executed a general release in favor of Alexion. Ms. O'Neill further agreed to be bound by certain customary restrictive covenants, including covenants related to confidentiality and non-solicitation of customers and employees. 
Personal Benefits
Our NEOs are eligible for the benefit programs we provide to all employees, such as medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits. Our U.S.-based NEOs are eligible to participate in our tax-qualified 401(k) plan on the same basis as other U.S. eligible employees. We also provide relocation benefits and other limited perquisites to executives that are also available to certain other employees. The relocation and other perquisites we provided to the NEOs in 2018 are disclosed in the "Summary Compensation Table" below.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our executives and directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines. Shares owned by the individual, unvested restricted stock and unvested restricted stock units count towards these ownership goal. Unearned PSUs do not count towards these ownership guidelines. Directors and officers are required to meet these guidelines within five years of becoming subject to them. All of our executives and directors currently satisfy the guidelines.
Executive Officers. Our current policy requires Alexion's executives to own shares with a value equal to a specific multiple of such executive's base salary as indicated in the table below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Officer Level Market Value as a Multiple of Base Salary
Officer Level Market Value as a Multiple of Base Salary
Chief Executive Officer 6x

Anti-hedging and Anti-pledging Policy
Our insider trading policy prohibits all directors and employees, including our executives, from pledging or engaging in hedging or similar transactions in Alexion's stock, such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, puts, calls, and short sales.
Recoupment Policy
We have adopted an executive compensation recoupment policy, or "clawback," that requires our independent directors to consider whether to seek reimbursement of any bonus or incentive (whether cash or equity) awarded to a Section 16 officer if and to the extent: (a) the amount of the bonus or incentive (whether cash or equity) compensation was calculated based upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement, (b) the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement, and (c) the amount of the bonus or incentive (whether cash or equity) compensation that would have been awarded to the executive had the financial results been properly reported would have been lower than the amount actually awarded. 
Compensation Risk Assessment
The Committee oversees an annual risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs to determine whether such programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. For 2018, the Committee concluded that the Company's compensation programs were appropriately balanced to mitigate compensation-related risk with cash and stock elements, financial and non-financial goals, and short-term and long-term rewards. The Company also has policies to mitigate compensation-related risk, including stock ownership guidelines, clawback provisions, and prohibitions on employee pledging and hedging activities. Further, the Company's policies on ethics and compliance along with its internal controls also mitigate against unnecessary or excessive risk taking by employees.
Section 162(m) Policy
Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, publicly held corporations generally may not deduct compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers, subject to limited transition relief for certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
The Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that attracts, retains and rewards the executive officers necessary for the Company's success, as described above. As a result, we currently and may in the future award compensation that is not fully deductible under Section 162(m) in order to ensure competitive levels of total compensation for our executive officers and when we otherwise view such compensation as consistent with our compensation policies. 
Report of Leadership and Compensation Committee
The Committee of the Board reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Alexion sponsors a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (NQDC Plan) which allows certain highly-compensated employees, including our currently employed NEOs, to make voluntary deferrals of up to 80% of their base salary and annual cash incentive award. The NQDC Plan is designed to work in conjunction with the 401(k) plan and provides for a total combined employer match of up to 6% of an employee's eligible earnings, up to the IRS annual specified contribution limits. The plan provides for immediate vesting of the match consistent with our immediate vesting of the Company match provided under our 401(k) plan. Notional accounts are maintained for each participant. Such notional accounts include employee and employer contributions and reflect the performance of investments selected by the employee or a default investment if the employee does not make a selection. These investment options include the mutual funds offered under our 401(k) plan.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change Of Control
We have entered into certain agreements that may require us to make payments and/or provide benefits to Dr. Hantson, Mr. Clancy Mr. Goff, Ms. Law and Dr. Orloff in connection with specified terminations of employment, in each case, subject to the applicable NEO's execution and nonrevocation of a general release of claims. See "Severance Payments and Benefits" and "Equity Awards" below for a description of these potential severance entitlements. These agreements also contain restrictive covenants and confidentiality provisions in favor of Alexion and require the NEO to assign all rights he or she may have or acquire in proprietary information. 
The tables below summarize the estimated potential payments to each of Dr. Hantson, Mr. Clancy, Mr. Goff, Ms. Law and Dr. Orloff, assuming that one of the events described in the table occurred on December 31, 2018.  In calculating the amounts due to the executive in respect of his or her equity awards in connection with such event, where applicable, the table below uses the closing price of a share of our common stock on December 31, 2018, $97.36, the last business day of 2018. However, each such executive's employment was not terminated on December 31, 2018 and a change in control did not occur on that date. Moreover, there can be no assurance that a termination of employment, a change in control or both would produce the same or similar results as those set forth below if either or both of them occurred on any other date or when the price of our common stock was different, or if any other assumption used in calculating the benefits set forth below is not correct in fact. Because she terminated employment with the Company during 2018, Ms. O'Neill is not included in the tables below.  The severance payments and benefits that Ms. O'Neill received in connection with her termination of employment is described below. 
For purposes of the following table, involuntary termination means a termination without cause, constructive termination, or good reason termination, as applicable, in each case as those terms are defined in the applicable NEO's agreement.

The cash severance amounts that would be payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with a termination of employment under various circumstances is described in more detail below. 
(2) Represents the value associated with cashing out unvested RSUs, earned PSUs and unearned PSUs, as applicable, and,  that accelerate as a result of the event described in the table, based on a stock price of $97.36, which was the closing price of Alexion's common stock on December 31, 2018, the last business day of Alexion's 2018 fiscal year. No value associated with  any stock options held by our named executive officers is included in the table because all unvested stock options held by them as of December 31, 2018 had a per share exercise price that was in excess of the closing price of Alexion's common stock on December 31, 2018. RSUs and PSUs were valued based on the number of shares associated with the unvested portion of each award multiplied by $97.36. Pursuant to their agreements, certain PSUs held by each of the named executive officers would vest to the extent determined in good faith by the Board based on achievement of the applicable performance conditions through termination of employment, as described in further detail under "Equity Awards" below.

The severance payments and benefits to which Dr. Hantson, Mr. Clancy, Mr. Goff,  Ms. Law, Dr. Orloff and Ms. O'Neill  are entitled are described below.  The terms cause, disability, non-renewal, constructive termination, good reason and change in control (or corollary terms) are each defined in the applicable agreements. 
Dr. Hantson
If Dr. Hantson's employment with Alexion is terminated other than within 18 months following a change in control (1) by the Company without cause, (2) following a constructive termination, or (3) upon non-renewal of his employment agreement by the Company, Alexion will be obligated to pay him an amount equal to 2.0  multiplied by the sum of (a) his then-current base salary and (b) the greater of (I) his average annual cash incentive award for the two years preceding the year in which his termination of employment occurs and (II) his target annual cash incentive award for the year in which Dr. Hantson's termination of employment occurs (such sum, the "CEO Severance Payment").  The CEO Severance Payment will be paid in installments over a 24-month period following his termination of employment.  Additionally, Dr. Hantson will be entitled to a lump sum cash amount equal to the value of the premiums that otherwise would have been paid by the Company, after applicable tax and withholdings, for his and his eligible dependents' participation in the Company's health and welfare for an 18-month period (the "Health Care Benefits").
In the event that Dr. Hantson's employment with Alexion is terminated within 18 months following  a change in control (1) by the Company without cause, (2) by him for good reason or following a constructive termination, or (3) upon non-renewal of his employment agreement by the Company, Alexion will be obligated to pay Dr. Hantson a cash lump sum payment equal to 3.0 multiplied by the CEO Severance Payment, a pro rata amount of his target annual cash incentive award for the year in which the termination occurs, and the Health Care Benefits.
In the event that Dr. Hantson's employment with Alexion terminates due to his death, his estate will be entitled to receive a cash lump sum equal to 3 months' of his base salary.

Severance Arrangement for Ms. O'Neill
In connection with Ms. O'Neill's resignation in June 2018, the Company and Ms. O'Neill entered into a severance agreement dated as of June 27, 2018 (the "Severance Agreement"). For a description of the terms of the Severance Agreement, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis above.
Equity Awards
The employment agreements with Dr. Hantson, Mr. Clancy, Mr. Goff, Ms. Law and Dr. Orloff, provide the following with respect to the effect of a termination of employment on outstanding equity awards, including a termination of employment following a change in control. 
If the executive's employment is terminated due to the executive's death or by the Company due to the executive's disability: (1) all of the executive's time-vesting equity awards will vest and become immediately exercisable, and (2) all other equity awards previously granted to the executive will vest as determined in good faith by the Board based on the percentage of goals and objectives  achieved by the executive and the Company.  
If the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by the executive  following a constructive termination, or  due to non-renewal of the executive's employment agreement by the Company, in each case, other than within 18 months following a change in control: (1) all of the executive's time-vesting equity awards granted in connection with the commencement of the term of the executive's employment will vest and become immediately exercisable, (2) all of the executive's other time-vesting equity awards that have been granted and are at least 50% vested as of the separation date will vest and become immediately exercisable, and (3) all other equity awards previously granted to and earned by the executive that are at least 50% vested as of the separation date will vest and become immediately exercisable.

agreement by the Company, in each case, within 18 months following a change in control: (1) all of the executive's time-vesting equity awards will vest and become immediately exercisable, and (2) all earned equity awards will vest and become immediately exercisable, and (3) all other unearned equity awards held by the executive will vest as determined in good faith by the Board based on the performance conditions achieved by the executive and Alexion.
Section 280G
The employment agreements with the NEOs each provide that if any payment or benefit that the executive would receive would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the payment will be reduced if such reduction would result in a greater after-tax amount to the named executive officer.
CEO Pay Ratio
We have estimated the median of the 2018 annual total compensation of our employees, other than our Chief Executive Officer to be $223,882. The 2018 annual total compensation of Dr. Hantson was $16,490,250. As a result, the estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our President and CEO to the estimated median of the annual total compensation of our other employees was approximately 74 to 1. 
Overview of Methodology and Assumptions
Alexion is a global company, with employees in 29 countries, approximately half of whom are located outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2018, Alexion's workforce consisted of approximately 2,656 full-time world-wide employees, including hourly employees.  
In determining the employee population to be used to calculate the compensation of the median employee, we included employees in all countries. As a result, the employee population that we used for purposes of determining the compensation of our median employee was 2,656 employees. We selected December 31, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year, as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee."  
Earnings of our employees outside the U.S. were converted to U.S. dollars using the currency exchange rates used for organizational planning purposes.  We did not make any cost of living adjustments. To identify the "median employee," we utilized 2018 base salary or base rate of pay (annualized in the case of employees who were not employed for the full fiscal year), target annual cash incentive award and target annual LTI award for our consistently applied compensation measure because we believe that this measure reasonably reflects the annual compensation of our employees. 
With respect to the SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio for our Company, as other companies have headquarters offices in different countries, have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

Director Compensation For Fiscal 2018 
[END TABLE]
The key objectives of our director compensation program are to attract qualified talent, provide pay that is commensurate with the substantial time commitment associated with Board service, and foster commonality of interest between Board members and shareholders. Non-employee director compensation is determined by the Board, acting on the recommendation of the Leadership and Compensation Committee. On an annual basis when determining compensation, the Compensation Committee considers market data for our peer group, which is the same peer group used for Alexion's executive compensation benchmarking, the S&P 500 Healthcare Index and the S&P 500 Index. The Compensation Committee also considers advice from FW Cook, the third-party compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee, regarding market practices for director compensation. During 2018, FW Cook conducted a review of director compensation levels relative to the market benchmarks and the results of their review indicated Alexion's current director compensation program is positioned below the median relative to our peer group. However, following its review of these results and in accordance with the recommendation of the Leadership and compensation Committee, the Board determined not to generally increase non-employee director compensation for 2018, but did approve a change to the equity component of director compensation described below.

Because Ms. Burns, Mr. Parven and Ms. Veneman did not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting, they were not granted an RSUs in 2018.

had no outstanding option awards as of December 31, 2018.  Ms.  Burns did not old any option awards as of December 31, 2018.
Director Compensation Policy
As noted above, the Board reviews director compensation each year. Following an analysis of director compensation at the peer group performed with the assistance of FW Cook, at the recommendation of the Leadership and Compensation Committee, the Board made one change to director compensation in 2018, the equity award component of director compensation was altered to provide that restricted stock units would constitute 100% of the equity compensation, instead of 50% stock options and 50% restricted stock units, as was the case in 2017. This change was consistent with Alexion's company-wide determination to discontinue the use of options as a form of compensation. This change did not result in any change in the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards and there was no increase in the cash retainer component of director compensation. It is the Board's policy that the CEO not participate during discussions on matters of compensation for the independent directors and the CEO does not vote on such matters. Under Alexion's director compensation policy, all non-employee directors with attendance at a total of 75% attendance of the Board and Committee meetings on which he or she serves since the prior annual meeting of shareholders, were entitled to receive the following compensation for 2018, in each case, prorated for partial years of service: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
n an annual retainer of $95,000 for non-Chairman members, and $195,000 for the Chairman, each paid quarterly; 
n an annual retainer of $35,000 for service as the chair of the Audit and Finance Committee, paid quarterly; and $25,000 for service as chair of each other Committee, paid quarterly (non-chair members of any committee are not separately compensated for service on such committee); and n a restricted stock unit award having a grant date value of $250,000, with the grant date value determined based on the 60 day trailing average closing price of the Company's common stock, vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director's continued service. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018 (as was the case in 2017 as well), Mr. Coughlin also received an additional annual retainer of $150,000, payable quarterly in 2018, in light of Mr. Coughlin's increased time commitment as Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee. 
At the recommendation of the Leadership and Compensation Committee, the Board has approved a change to director compensation that will be effective as of the 2019 Annual Meeting. A director may, at such director's election, elect to receive restricted stock units in lieu of receiving all or a portion of his or her annual cash retainer for service as a director and for service as the chair of a committee. The value of the restricted stock units will be determined in the same manner as the annual restricted stock units awarded to directors as described above and will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director's continued service.
Director Deferred Compensation
Each of our directors is eligible to participate in our non-employee director deferred compensation plan (the Director Deferred Compensation Plan). The Director Deferred Compensation Plan allows a director to make voluntary deferrals of up to 100% of their annual cash retainer, committee chair cash retainer and their annual restricted stock unit award. In the event that the director elects to receive a restricted stock unit award in lieu of all or a portion of their annual cash retainer and/or committee chair cash retainer, the common stock issued upon the vesting of such restricted stock unit award may be voluntarily deferred as well pursuant to the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company does not match any

director contributions to the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred cash retainer amounts are deemed to be invested in various mutual funds and similar investment choices selected by the director from a list of investment choices available under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Common stock that is deferred under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan remains in the form of Alexion common stock until after the period 6 months following the end of such director's service on our Board, at which point the director may elect to diversify such notional investment in common stock into the mutual funds and similar investment choices available under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. For the purpose of the director compensation table above, we have presented such information as if none of the amounts were deferred.
Non-employee director stock ownership guidelines 
Under our stock ownership guidelines, non-employee directors are expected to accumulate, within five years of their election to the Board, shares of Alexion stock equal in value to at least five times the amount of their annual cash retainer. All non-employee directors with more than five years of service have met our stock ownership guidelines, and all non-employee directors with less than five years of service have either met, or are on track to meet, our stock ownership guidelines within the expected time. Non-employee directors are also prohibited from entering into any hedging, pledging or derivative transactions in our stock.
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
The Board of Directors reviews and approves transactions between Alexion on the one hand and a related party, such as our directors, officers, holders of more than five percent of our voting securities and their affiliates, the immediate family members of any of the foregoing persons and any other persons whom the Board determined may be considered a related party, on the other hand. Prior to Board consideration of a transaction with a related party, the material facts as to the related party's relationship or interest in the transaction would be disclosed to the Board, and the transaction is not considered approved by the Board unless a majority of the directors who are not interested in the transaction approve the transaction. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the non interested directors take into account such factors as they deem appropriate, which include whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. Please see "Executive Compensation-Summary Compensation Table," "Executive Compensation-Director Compensation Policy" for information regarding compensation of our executive officers and directors. There have been no other related party transactions during fiscal year 2018. 
Audit and Finance Committee Report
The Audit and Finance Committee reviewed and discussed Alexion's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the Board of Directors and discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Alexion's independent registered public accounting firm during the year ended December 31, 2018, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301. In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee received from the independent registered public accounting firm written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit and Finance Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditors' independence from management and Alexion, including a review of audit and non-audit fees and the matters covered by the written disclosures and letter provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
It is the Audit and Finance Committee's policy that it must pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by Alexion's independent auditors, the fees to be paid for those services and the time period over which those services are to be provided. On an annual basis, the independent auditors present a listing of all services they expect to perform for Alexion in the ensuing one-year period, including fee estimates, in sufficient detail to enable the Audit and Finance Committee to perform an independent review of each proposed service. The Audit and Finance Committee reviews this list and approves appropriate services which, in the Audit and Finance Committee's judgment, will not impair the auditors' independence. With respect to any additional services proposed to be performed by the independent auditors during the year, management will evaluate the impact on the independent auditor's independence and obtain Audit and Finance Committee approval for such service. The Audit and Finance Committee's Pre-Approval Policy authorizes the Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee to pre-approve certain recurring services less than $250,000 and certain non-recurring services less than $50,000. The Chairman of the committee must report any such approved services at the next following meeting of the Audit and Finance Committee.

Proposal No. 2 – Ratification Of Appointment Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[END TABLE]
The Audit and Finance Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019. The Board of Directors has directed that the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm be submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If a quorum is present, the proposal to ratify the appointment of PwC as independent registered public accounting firm will require approval by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Shareholder ratification of the appointment is not required by law or otherwise. The Board is submitting this proposal to our shareholders for ratification because it believes it to be a good corporate practice. 
PwC, Alexion's independent registered public accounting firm, has served as the Alexion's  auditor since 2002. If our shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit and Finance Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC, but may still retain the firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit and Finance Committee in its discretion may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Committee determines that a change would be in the best interests of Alexion and our shareholders. Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS PROPOSAL NO. 2 TO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALEXION AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL THEREOF.

Proposal No. 3 – Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Our shareholders have an annual opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. As described in greater detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A), the primary objective of Alexion's executive compensation policy is to attract and retain its key executives and motivate our executives to achieve short- and long-term objectives and success. The Leadership and Compensation Committee approves and implements compensation programs based on these stated philosophies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
n Ensure compensation programs are structured to attract, retain and motivate the best talent; 
n Pay for performance, reward company and individual achievement, and align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders; 
n Ensure compensation is competitive with the companies that compete with us for talent; 
n Maintain an appropriate balance between cash and equity incentives; and n Be fair and consistent. 
[END TABLE]
The Leadership and Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that Alexion's 2018 executive compensation is strongly aligned with our philosophy, objectives and company performance. We encourage shareholders to carefully review the CD&A. The CD&A describes Alexion's executive compensation program and the considerations taken into account by the Leadership and Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors with respect to the compensation paid to the NEOs for 2018. 
The Board of Directors is requesting that Alexion shareholders cast a non-binding advisory vote in favor of the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Alexion's named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the CD&A, the compensation tables and other narrative discussion, is hereby approved.
Because this proposal asks for a non-binding, advisory vote, there is no "required vote" that would constitute approval. We value the opinions expressed by our shareholders in this advisory vote, and our Leadership and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for overseeing and administering our executive compensation program, will consider the outcome of the vote when designing our compensation programs and making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not have any effect on the results of those deliberations.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 3, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS.

Proposal No. 4 - Shareholder Proposal Requesting Proxy Access Amendments 
[END TABLE]
Mr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, has notified Alexion that he intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden states that, since November 10, 2017, he has owned no fewer than 40 shares of our common stock and that he intends to meet the beneficial ownership requirements under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, until after the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting. The shareholder proposal is quoted verbatim below, followed by an opposition statement from the Board.
Shareholder Proposal
Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access
Shareholders request that our board of directors take the steps necessary to enable as many shareholders as may be needed to aggregate their shares to equal 3% of our stock owned continuously for 3-years in order to make use of our shareholder proxy access provisions. 
Under current provisions, even if the 20 largest public pension funds were able to aggregate their shares, they would not meet the 3% criteria for a continuous 3-years at most companies examined by the Council of Institutional Investors. Additionally many of the largest investors of major companies are routinely passive investors who would be unlikely to be part of the proxy access shareholder aggregation process. Our company has a 20 participant limit for shareholder proxy access. 
Under this proposal it is likely that the number of shareholders who participate in the aggregation process would still be a modest number due to the rigorous rules our company adopted for a shareholder to make an application to qualify as one of the aggregation participants. Plus it is easy for our management to reject potential aggregating shareholders because management simply needs to find lacking one item from a list of requirements. 
This proposal deserves added attention since the price of Alexion stock fell from $158 to $115 in the 5-years years leading up to the due date for this proposal. 
In addition to the falling stock price a July 2018 article said the Department of Health and Human Services launched a probe of Alexion in regard to Alexion support of charities related to Medicare patients. This was the latest in a series of issues Alexion had faced in 2018. 
Alexion said the U.S. attorneys' office requested documents regarding its support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients taking Alexion drugs, Alexion's provision of free drugs to Medicare patients and Alexion compliance policies and training materials concerning anti-kickback laws or payments to charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. 
Alexion replaced executives in 2018. In March, Alexion appointed a new CEO months after a leadership shake-up and investigation into drug sales practices. Alexion said in January it found weaknesses in its financial reporting controls after investigating allegations of improper sales of Soliris, a drug used to treat a rare blood disorder. 
Alexion's Sao Paulo offices were raided by Brazilian authorities in May as part of an investigation into its sales practices, according to Brazil's national police. Brazil police were investigating whether Alexion, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 76 
[END TABLE]
helped by a local patient association, subsidized lawsuits for patients to get access to Soliris through the national health system.
Shareholder proposals such as this have taken a leadership role in improving the governance rules of Alexion. After receiving shareholder proposals Alexion terminated its poison pill (2015) and adopted a rudimentary right for shareholders to call for a special meeting (2016).
Please vote yes:
Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access - Proposal 4
Opposition Statement to Proposal 4
Alexion's Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" the shareholder proposal. The Board has considered the shareholder proposal and, for the reasons described below, believes that the proposal is not in the best interests of Alexion and its shareholders.
Our current proxy access framework strikes the appropriate balance between promoting shareholder nomination rights and protecting the interests of all our shareholders.
On January 8, 2016, the Board adopted proxy access Bylaw provisions for Alexion after carefully assessing the relative advantages and disadvantages to shareholders and Alexion of various proxy access formulations. Our Bylaws provide that under certain circumstances, a qualifying shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders (the "aggregation limit"), who have maintained continuous ownership of at least 3% percent of our common stock for at least 3 years, may nominate and include a specified number of director nominees in our annual meeting proxy statement. 
We believe the framework we ultimately adopted for proxy access gives shareholders a workable process for such nominations, while also limiting the risk of shareholders mis-using proxy access. Removing the aggregation limit as the shareholder proposal seeks to do would disrupt this balance.
In addition, the largest 20 institutional shareholders of Alexion held approximately 61% of the outstanding shares of Alexion according to regulatory filings as of mid-February, 2019. Based on this concentration of share ownership at Alexion, the aggregation limit is not a significant impediment to Alexion shareholders aggregating at least 3% of the total shares outstanding. Among the top 100 largest shareholders alone, there are countless combinations of a limited number of shareholders whose aggregate holdings would equal or exceed 3%, with the holding period requirement being an additional threshold to be met. Thus, we do not believe it is necessary to eliminate the aggregation limit in order to facilitate shareholder participation with respect to proxy access.
Furthermore, when a shareholder group submits a nominee pursuant to our proxy access Bylaws, Alexion must confirm that the eligibility and procedural requirements have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied through the annual meeting date) by each member of the group. Without this reasonable aggregation limit, Alexion would have to undertake that confirmation process with respect to potentially large numbers of shareholders, which would cost Alexion a considerable amount of time and resources and impede the exercise of proxy access rights by other shareholders. 
The proposal is not consistent with current proxy access provisions of the overwhelming majority of companies that have adopted proxy access bylaws.
In addition, a 20-shareholder aggregation limit is widely embraced by companies, including companies that are institutional investors and major asset managers, that have adopted proxy access and is widely accepted and endorsed by institutional shareholders. According to publicly available data, of all U.S. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 77 
[END TABLE]
companies that have adopted or modified proxy access between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018, over 90% have adopted an aggregation limit of 20 shareholders or fewer. A 20-shareholder aggregation limit is also the threshold adopted in the bylaws of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., State Street Corporation and BlackRock, Inc., the publicly traded parent companies of some of the largest institutional shareholders in the United States.
We have strong corporate governance and shareholder engagement practices.
Alexion's corporate governance structure reflects our commitment to strong and effective governance practices and an openness to input from our shareholders. Our Board regularly engages with our shareholders and seeks feedback about our corporate governance policies and practices. We carefully consider the shareholder input we receive and make changes to our corporate governance policies and practices as appropriate. In addition to proxy access, we have instituted a number of corporate governance policies and practices to promote transparency, accountability and responsiveness, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Substantial board refreshment and effective director succession planning in recent years, resulting in four new independent directors being appointed since 2017 and eight of the Board's nine independent directors having a tenure of under five years; 
• Board composition aligned with Alexion's business strategies, industry positioning and risk oversight priorities; 
• Board evaluation and self-assessment practices;  
• Off-season and in-season engagement with shareholders on strategic, business and governance matters; 
• Declassified Board with all directors standing for election annually; 
• Majority vote standard for uncontested director elections; 
• Separation of our Chairman and CEO roles and appointment of an independent Chairman; 
• Requirement of a Lead Independent Director with robust responsibilities when our Chairman is not independent; 
• Shareholder approval for many key corporate actions before action may be taken; 
• No supermajority voting standard in our charter and bylaw provisions, thus allowing shareholders to approve binding charter and bylaw amendments with a majority vote; 
• Proxy access provisions; 
• No shareholder rights plan (also known as a "poison pill") in place.  
[END TABLE]
In summary, the Board believes the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary because of our strong corporate governance and shareholder engagement practices, including our existing proxy access framework. Our proxy access Bylaws were designed to strike the appropriate balance between the risks and benefits of proxy access and is consistent with market practice. Accordingly, we have carefully considered this proposal and do not believe that it is in the best interests of Alexion and its shareholders for these reasons.

Under SEC rules, if a shareholder wants us to include a proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy for presentation at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the proposal must be received by us, Attention: Corporate Secretary, at our principal executive offices by December 27, 2019.
Shareholder proposals not intended to be included in our 2019 Proxy Statement for Alexion's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be timely if delivered no earlier than November 27, 2019 and no later than the close of business on December 27, 2019. Unless such notice is received by us, Attention: Corporate Secretary, at our principal executive offices, on or before the foregoing date, proxies with respect to such meeting will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to any such matter.
Other Shareholder Communications with the Board of Directors
Generally, shareholders who have questions or concerns should contact our investor relations team. For questions and communications shareholders wish to address directly to the Board, shareholders should address such communications to the Board, the particular committee, or particular director, c/o Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 121 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, MA 02210, Attention: Corporate Secretary. All such communications should include a representation from the submitting shareholder setting forth the shareholder's address and the number of shares of Alexion common stock beneficially owned by the shareholder.
The Corporate Secretary will (i) be primarily responsible for monitoring communications from shareholders and (ii) provide copies or summaries of such communications to the Board, the relevant committee, or the director to whom such communication is addressed, as the Corporate Secretary considers appropriate. Each shareholder communication will be forwarded if it relates to a substantive matter and includes suggestions or comments that the Corporate Secretary considers to be important for the directors, or director, to know. In general, shareholder communications relating to corporate governance and long-term corporate strategy are more likely to be forwarded than shareholder communications relating to personal grievances and matters as to which we tend to receive repetitive or duplicative communications. 
The Board will give appropriate attention to written communications on such issues and will respond as appropriate.
"Householding" of Proxy Materials
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. Alexion and some brokers "household" proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or Alexion that they or Alexion will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are

held in a brokerage account, or Alexion if you hold shares directly in your name. You can notify Alexion by sending a written request to Corporate Secretary, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 121 Seaport Boulevard, Boston, MA 02210 or by calling (475) 230-2596. 
Other Business
Other than the matters described in this proxy statement, the Board of Directors knows of no other business to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. However, if any other business properly comes before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
The prompt return of your proxy will be appreciated and helpful in obtaining the necessary vote. Therefore, whether or not you expect to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, please sign the proxy and return it in the enclosed envelope. If you need directions to the meeting, please call Alexion's Investor Relations at (475) 230-2596.
A COPY OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018 WILL BE SENT WITHOUT CHARGE TO ANY SHAREHOLDER REQUESTING IT IN WRITING FROM: ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., 121 SEAPORT BOULEVARD, BOSTON, MA 02210, ATTN: INVESTOR RELATIONS.
