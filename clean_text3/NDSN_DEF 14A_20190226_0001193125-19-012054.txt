PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS WHOSE TERMS EXPIRE IN 2022 
The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for director and for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at the Annual Meeting. The Governance and Nominating Committee has recommended, and the Board has approved, the persons named as nominees for terms expiring in 2022 and, unless otherwise marked, a duly executed and properly submitted proxy will be voted for such nominees. Nominees Lee C. Banks, Randolph W. Carson, and Victor L. Richey, Jr. currently serve as directors. All nominees have agreed to stand for election for a three-year term. 
In considering each director nominee and the composition of the Board as a whole, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers a diverse group of experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills, including diversity in gender, ethnicity, and race, which the Governance and Nominating Committee believes enables a director nominee to make significant contributions to the Board, Nordson, and our shareholders. 
The current-serving directors, including the nominees, collectively have a mix of various skills and qualifications, some of which are listed in the table below.

In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers the director's skills and expertise, participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the results of the annual Board evaluation, and past meeting attendance. 
We believe that the tenure spectrum of our directors provides an effective mix of deep knowledge and new perspectives. The Board does not believe in a specific limit for the overall length of time an independent director may serve. Directors who have served on the Board for an extended period can provide valuable insight into the operations and future of the Company based on their experience with, and understanding of, the Company's history, policies, and objectives. Our Governance Guidelines provide that a director is expected to retire at the conclusion of the Board meeting immediately prior to a director's 72nd birthday. With respect to Mr. Keithley and Ms. Puma, we see a strategic advantage in their senior-in-service status. Not only do they bring experience, deep institutional knowledge, and historical context to the vitality and growth of Nordson, they serve as seasoned advisors to Mr. Hilton. 
It is intended that proxies that are duly executed and properly submitted but do not withhold the authority to vote for any or all of the nominees will be voted for the election as directors of all of the nominees named below. At this time, the Board knows of no reason why any nominee might not be a candidate at the 2019 Annual Meeting. However, in the event any one or more of such nominees becomes unavailable for election, proxies will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the proxy holder. 
The name and age (as of February 26, 2019) of each of the three nominees for election as directors for terms expiring in 2022, as well as present directors whose terms will continue after the Annual Meeting, appear below, together with his or her principal occupation for at least the past five years, the year each became a director of the Company and certain other relevant information.

No shareholder or group that beneficially owns 1% or more of our outstanding common shares has recommended a candidate for election as a director at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Cumulative Voting 
Voting for directors will be cumulative if any shareholder provides notice in writing to the President, an Executive Vice President, or the Secretary of Nordson of a desire to have cumulative voting. The notice must be received at least 48 hours before the time set for the Annual Meeting, and an announcement of the notice must be made at the beginning of the meeting by the Chair or the Secretary, or by or on behalf of the shareholder giving the notice. If cumulative voting is in effect, each shareholder will be entitled to cast, in the election of directors, a number of votes equal to the product of the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares that the shareholder is voting. Shareholders may cast all of these votes for one nominee or distribute them among several 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 nominees, as they see fit. If cumulative voting is in effect, shares represented by each properly submitted proxy will also be voted on a cumulative basis, with the votes distributed among the nominees in accordance with the judgment of the persons named on the proxy/voting instruction card. 
To date, we have not received a notice from any shareholder of his, her, or its intention to request cumulative voting. 
Majority Voting Policy 
The Director nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected (plurality standard). However, our majority voting policy states that any Director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in his/her favor is required to submit his/her resignation to the Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board would then consider each resignation and determine whether to accept or reject it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of a Director and are not counted under our majority voting policy. 
Required Vote 
The election of directors requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock voting at the Annual Meeting. Under the plurality voting standard, the nominees receiving the most "for" votes will be elected, regardless of whether any nominee received a majority of the votes. Only shares that are voted in favor of a particular nominee will be counted toward such nominee's achievement of a plurality. Shares present at the meeting that are not voted for a particular nominee or shares present by proxy where the shareholder properly withheld authority to vote for such nominee (including broker non-votes) will not be counted toward such nominee's achievement of a plurality, but will be counted for quorum purposes.

The Governance Guidelines contain general principles regarding the functions of Nordson's Board of Directors (the "Board") and Board committees. The Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes the 2018 Annual Report and this Proxy Statement, are available at: www.nordson.com/en/our-company/investors/annual-reports-and-presentations. Upon request, copies of the Annual Report to Shareholders will be mailed to you (at no charge) by contacting Nordson Corporation, Attn: Corporate Communications, 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio 44145.

Director Independence 
In accordance with the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq"), and our Governance Guidelines, the Board must consist of a majority of independent directors. The Board has determined that Ms. Puma and Messrs. Banks, Carson, George, Jaehnert, Keithley, Merriman, and Richey each satisfy the definition of "independent director" under these listing standards. Mr. Hilton is not an independent director because he serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
In determining independence, each year the Board affirmatively determines, among other things, whether directors have a "material relationship" with Nordson. When assessing the "materiality" of a director's relationship with Nordson, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a consideration of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. Where an affiliation is present, the Board considers the frequency or regularity of the provision of services, whether the services are being carried out at arm's length in the ordinary course of business and whether the services are being provided substantially on the same terms to Nordson as those prevailing at the time from unrelated parties for comparable transactions. With respect to Audit Committee members, the Board must affirmatively determine that such directors, in addition to the general independence requirements described above, satisfy certain financial education requirements and do not, among other things, accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from Nordson. 
As part of our commitment to ensuring director independence, we have a monitoring and reporting program with respect to purchases of products supplied by, or to, a company which may employ a director to ensure the avoidance of any conflicts of interest resulting from our relationship. Mr. Banks, a director, serves as president and chief operating officer of Parker-Hannifin Corporation. Mr. Richey, a director, serves as a director of ESCO Technologies Inc. These two companies purchase components manufactured by a number of our business units in volumes that are insignificant when compared to the respective companies' and Nordson's annual revenue for fiscal year 2018. The Board does not believe that these relationships impair the independence of Messrs.

[END TABLE]
Director Qualifications 
Through its selection and vetting process, the Governance and Nominating Committee seeks not only to identify directors that meet basic criteria, but also to enhance the diversity of the Board in such areas as professional experience, race, gender, ethnicity, and age and to obtain a variety of occupational, educational, and personal backgrounds on the Board in order to provide a range of viewpoints and perspectives. As a whole, we believe that the Board should possess a combination of skills, professional experience, and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee the Company's business. Diversity of background includes racial and gender diversity. Twenty-five percent of our independent directors are women or racially diverse individuals. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee also periodically evaluates the composition of the Board to assess the skills and experience that are currently represented on the Board, as well as the skills and experience that the Board will find valuable in the future, considering the Company's current situation and strategic plans. We believe that this focus on finding qualified directors from diverse backgrounds has allowed the Company to assemble a Board comprised of directors of the highest caliber and with a wide range of viewpoints. 
Consideration of Director Candidates Recommended by Shareholders 
Under its charter, the Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for vetting shareholder nominations of directors. The Committee does not have a formal policy with respect to the consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders. However, its practice is to consider those candidates on the same basis and in the same manner as it considers recommendations from other sources. For more information on how a shareholder can recommend a candidate, see the "Questions and Answers About the Annual Meeting and These Proxy Materials" section of this proxy statement. 
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
We have a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the "Code") that applies to all Nordson directors, officers, employees, and its subsidiaries, wherever located. Our Code contains the general guidelines and principles for conducting Nordson's business consistent with the highest standards of business ethics. Our Code embodies our five guiding values, which form the foundation of our Company: Integrity, Excellence, Passion for Our Customers, Energy, and Respect for People. Our employees are expected to report all suspected violations of Company policies and the law, including incidents of harassment or discrimination. We will take appropriate steps to investigate all such reports and will take appropriate action. Under no circumstances will employees be subject to any disciplinary or retaliatory action for reporting, in good faith, a possible violation of our Code or applicable law or for cooperating in any investigation of a possible violation. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Governance Guidelines require us to have either an independent Chair of the Board or a presiding independent director if the Chair is not an independent director. The Governance Guidelines set forth the responsibilities of the Chair of the Board and the Presiding Director when the Chair of the Board is not an independent director. At present, the Chair of the Board position is separate from the Chief Executive Officer position. The Board's role in risk oversight does not affect the Board's leadership structure. 
We believe that separating the Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions provides independent oversight of management while permitting our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Hilton, to focus his time and energy on setting the strategic direction for the Company, overseeing daily operations, engaging with external constituents, developing and mentoring our future leaders, and promoting employee engagement at all levels of the organization. Our independent Chair of the Board, Michael J. Merriman, Jr., leads the Board in the performance of its duties by establishing agendas and ensuring appropriate meeting content (in collaboration with Mr. Hilton), presiding during regularly held executive sessions with our independent directors, actively engaging with all independent directors and Mr. Hilton between Board meetings, and providing overall guidance to Mr. Hilton as to the Board's views and perspectives, particularly on the strategic direction of the Company. 
Meetings of the Board of Directors 
The Board held twelve meetings during fiscal year 2018. In addition, there were a total of eighteen meetings of our committees. Nordson's policy is to require attendance and active participation by directors at Board and committee meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which the director served during fiscal year 2018. Directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting. All of Nordson's directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on February 27, 2018. 
Executive Sessions of Independent Directors 
Pursuant to our Governance Guidelines, independent directors meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. The Chair of the Board (or, when our Chair is not an independent director, the Presiding Director) chairs all regularly scheduled executive sessions of the Board, and also has authority to convene meetings of the independent directors at any time with appropriate notice. 
Oversight of Risk 
The Board plays an active role, both as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risks. Management is responsible for the Company's day-to-day risk management activities. The Company has established an enterprise risk framework for identifying, aggregating, and evaluating risk across the enterprise. The risk framework is integrated with the Company's annual planning, audit scoping, and control evaluation management by its internal auditor. 
The involvement of the Board in assessing our business strategy at least annually is a key part of its oversight of risk management, its assessment of management's appetite for risk, and its determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for Nordson. The Board regularly receives updates from management and outside advisors regarding this oversight responsibility. 
In addition, our Board committees each oversee certain aspects of risk management as presented below:

[END TABLE]
The Audit and Compensation Committees rely also on the advice and counsel of our independent auditors and independent compensation consultant, respectively, to raise awareness of any risk issues that may arise during their regular reviews of our financial statements, audit work, and executive compensation policies and practices. The Board is updated on each committee's risk oversight and other activities via meeting reports from each committee chair to the full Board.

 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  19 
[END TABLE]
Review of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review and approval of transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and certain persons that are required to be disclosed in proxy statements, which are commonly referred to as "related persons transactions." Related persons include our directors, nominees for election as a director, persons controlling over 5% of our common shares, executive officers, and the immediate family members of each of these individuals. Under the written policy, Nordson's Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing any related persons transactions and will consider factors it deems appropriate, including but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. To the extent any member of the Audit Committee is involved in any transaction under review, such member recuses themselves. 
We have a monitoring and reporting program with respect to transactions with products supplied by, or to, a company which may employ a director, to ensure the avoidance of any conflicts of interest resulting from our relationship. This program includes all such transactions collectively over $120,000 in one annual period. Under the program, we reviewed transactions with all companies which employ a director or have one of our directors serving as a member of its board. The review determined that any related persons transactions were neither material nor significant to either Nordson or the respective director's company. All such transactions were conducted at arms-length. Information on the related persons transaction review is set forth under the caption "Director Independence" above. 
The Board's Role in Talent Development 
A primary Board responsibility is to ensure that we have the appropriate management talent to successfully execute our strategies. Our Board believes that effective talent development is critical to Nordson's continued success. Our Board's involvement in leadership development and succession planning is systematic and ongoing. The Board plans for CEO succession and oversees management's planning for succession of other key executive positions. Our Board calendar includes at least one meeting each year during which the Board conducts a detailed review of the Company's talent strategies, leadership pipeline, and succession plans for key executive positions. The Compensation Committee oversees the process of succession planning and implements programs to retain and motivate key talent. To assist the Board, the CEO annually provides the Board with an in-depth assessment of senior managers and their potential to succeed to the position of CEO or other key executive positions. 
Self-Assessments 
On a regular basis, the Board conducts a self-assessment of the Board as a whole to determine, among other matters, whether the Board is functioning effectively. The independent directors also undertake a peer assessment of other independent directors as part of this self-assessment process. Each committee of the Board also conducts a self-assessment of the committee's effectiveness. The Board considers this process to be the primary means of determining whether incumbent directors continue to demonstrate the attributes that should be reflected on the Board, or whether changes to membership are appropriate. 
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Board has three standing committees – Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee – and an Executive Committee. Respective committee functions, memberships and number of meetings held during fiscal year 2018 are listed below. All members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee are independent under the independence standards of Nasdaq and our Governance Guidelines. A more detailed discussion of the purposes, duties, and responsibilities of the committees is found in the respective committee charters which are available at: www.nordson.com/en/our-company/corporate-governance.

(1)  In February 2018, Mr. Merriman was elected Chair of the Board and Mr. Jaehnert was elected chair of the Audit  Committee. In May 2018, Mr. Merriman was appointed as a member of the Compensation Committee and removed as a member of the Audit Committee and Mr. Keithley was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee and removed as a member of the  Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has designated Mr. Jaehnert, who is an independent director under the Nasdaq listing standings and the SEC's audit committee requirements, as an "audit committee financial expert" pursuant to the SEC's final rules implementing Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Shareholders should understand that the designation of Mr. Jaehnert as an "audit committee financial expert" is an SEC disclosure requirement and that it does not impose upon him any duties, obligations, or liabilities that are greater than those imposed on him as members of the Audit Committee and the Board in the absence of such designation. 
The Audit Committee has confirmed Ernst & Young LLP's independence from management and the Company, including compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors' independence. The Audit Committee Report to the Board is at page 78 of this Proxy Statement. 
Director Compensation 
Objectives of Director Compensation 
Quality non-employee directors are critical to our success. We believe that the two primary duties of non-employee directors are (1) to effectively represent the long-term interests of our shareholders and (2) to provide guidance to management. As such, our compensation program for non-employee directors is designed to meet several key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adequately compensate directors for their responsibilities and time commitments and for the personal liabilities and risks  that they face as directors of a public company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract the highest caliber non-employee directors by offering a compensation  program consistent with those at companies of similar size, complexity, and business character;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align the interests of directors with our shareholders by providing a significant portion of compensation in equity and  requiring directors to own our stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide compensation that is simple and transparent to shareholders and reflects corporate governance best practices; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Where possible, provide flexibility in the form and timing of payments.  
[END TABLE]
Elements of Director Compensation 
We believe that the following components of our director compensation program support the objectives above: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide cash compensation through retainers for board and committee service, as well as additional cash retainers to the  Chair of the Board and chairs of our standing Board committees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     We do not provide board and committee meeting fees. Compensating our directors in this manner simplifies the administration of our program and creates greater equality in rewarding service on  committees of the Board. The additional retainers compensate directors for the additional responsibilities and time commitments involved with chair responsibilities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the non-employee directors receive annual awards of restricted share units  which vest 100% on the last day of the fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We pay for, provide, or reimburse directors for expenses incurred to attend Board and committee meetings and director  education programs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors do not have a retirement plan but are afforded business travel and accident insurance coverage.   
[END TABLE]
Determining Director Compensation.    The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board provides oversight on director compensation. The Committee oversees, reviews, and reports to the Board on director compensation. The Committee annually reviews competitive market data for non-employee director compensation and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for its approval. The Committee is assisted in performing its duties by Exequity LLP ("Exequity"), the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
Exequity's review for fiscal year 2018 consisted of an analysis of competitive market data from a selected peer group of companies. The peer group is consistent with the peer group Exequity used for the executive compensation review conducted during fiscal year 2018. 
The components and respective amounts of non-employee director compensation for fiscal year 2018 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Annual Cash Retainer      75,000 
   Annual Chair Cash  Retainer:      
 ¡  Chair of the Board      60,000 
 ¡  Audit Committee Chair      15,000 
 ¡  Compensation Committee Chair      10,000 
 ¡  Governance & Nominating Committee Chair        8,000 
   Annual Equity Award (Restricted Share Units) (1)       125,000  
   Annual Equity Award (Restricted Share Units) (1)       125,000  
(1)  The number of restricted share units granted is determined by the closing share price on the date of grant.   
[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Retainer.    The cash retainers are paid in equal quarterly installments. For directors who join the Board after the commencement of a fiscal year, the annual retainer is prorated based on the number of months remaining in the fiscal year. Due to Committee membership changes during fiscal year 2018, the director cash retainers for Messrs. Jaehnert, Keithley, and Merriman were prorated. 
Annual Equity Award.    Restricted share unit awards are granted annually and are effective the first business day of the fiscal year. The awards vest 100% on the last day of the fiscal year. If a director retires from the Board prior to the vesting date, restricted share units are forfeited on a pro-rata basis, based on the number of months served prior to retirement. If a director is elected by the Board or shareholders after the commencement of a fiscal year, the restricted share unit award is prorated based on the number of months remaining in the fiscal year. If restricted share units are not deferred, then the units and accrued dividend equivalents convert to Nordson common shares on a one-for-one basis on the vesting date. 
Deferred Compensation Program.    Under the directors deferred compensation plan, non-employee directors may defer all or a portion of their annual cash retainer into a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation account in the form of deferred cash or share equivalent units. Amounts deferred (i) as cash will earn a return based on the 10-year Treasury bill constant maturity interest rate, or (ii) as share equivalent units will earn a return based on our common share price and accrued dividend equivalents. We do not pay above market or preferential interest rates under this deferred compensation plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  23 
[END TABLE]
Directors may elect to defer the receipt of restricted share units prior to the grant date. If receipt is deferred, the restricted share units and accrued dividend equivalents will convert to share equivalent units on a one-for-one basis on the vesting date and are not subject to forfeiture. 
After retirement from our Board, the share equivalent units and any cash retainers that were deferred as share equivalent units are paid out in our common shares in predetermined quarterly installments over a four-year period. Any cash retainers that were deferred as cash, and accrued interest thereon, will be paid out in cash in predetermined quarterly installments over a four-year period. 
Share Ownership Guidelines.    The Board believes that our non-employee directors should have a meaningful ownership interest in the Company and has implemented share ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors. The ownership guidelines require non-employee directors to own a minimum of five times their annual cash retainer in common shares. Shares held in the form of share equivalent units or restricted share units qualify as shares owned under the guidelines. Newly elected directors have five years within which to achieve the share ownership requirement. All non-employee directors currently meet the guideline. 
Charitable Gifts Matching Program.    Current and retired non-employee directors may participate in our charitable matching gift program that is available to all current and retired employees. Directors Banks, George, Jaehnert, Keithley, Puma, and Richey, Jr. participated in this program in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, we made matching contributions totaling $49,500 under this program. 
Indemnity Agreements.    We have indemnification agreements for directors in order to attract and retain highly qualified candidates to serve as our directors. The indemnification agreements are intended to secure the protection for our directors contemplated by our Regulations and to the full extent permitted by Ohio law. 
Director Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 
The following table sets forth the total compensation of each non-employee director for services provided as a director for fiscal year 2018. Due to Committee membership changes the director fees for Messrs. Jaehnert, Keithley, and Merriman were prorated.

PROPOSAL 2: RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal Year Ending October 31, 2019 
Ernst & Young LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our auditors for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. Although ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors is not required by law, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that shareholders should be given the opportunity to express their views on the subject. While not binding on the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, the failure of the shareholders to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditors would be considered by the Board of Directors in determining whether or not to continue the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP. Ultimately, the Audit Committee retains full discretion and will make all determinations with respect to the appointment of independent auditors, whether or not our shareholders ratify the appointment. 
As provided in the Audit Committee's charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for directly appointing, retaining, terminating, and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Audit Committee continuously evaluates the independence and effectiveness of Ernst & Young LLP and its personnel, and the cost and quality of its audit and audit-related services. 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services 
At the start of each fiscal year, our Audit Committee pre-approves the audit services and audit-related services, if any, together with specific details regarding such services anticipated being required for such fiscal year including, as available, estimated fees. The Audit Committee reviews the services provided to date and actual fees against the estimates and such fee amounts may be updated for presentation at the regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. Additional pre-approval is required before actual fees for any service can exceed the originally pre-approved amount. The Audit Committee may also revise the list of pre-approved services and related fees from time to time. All of the services described below under the captions "Audit Fees" and "Audit-Related Fees" with respect to fiscal years 2017 and 2018 were approved in accordance with this policy. 
If we seek to engage our independent registered public accounting firm for other services that are not considered subject to general approval as described above, then the Audit Committee must approve such specific engagement as well as the estimated fees. Such engagement will be presented to the Audit Committee for approval at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If the timing of the project requires an expedited decision, then we may ask the chair of the Audit Committee to approve such engagement. Any such approval by the chair is then reported to the full Audit Committee for ratification at the next Audit Committee meeting. In any event, approval of any engagement by the Audit Committee or the chair of the Audit Committee is required before our independent registered public accounting firm may commence any engagement. Additional approval is required before any fees can exceed approved fees for any such specifically-approved services.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of our outstanding common shares to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC, and to furnish copies of those reports to us. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the Forms 3, 4, and 5 and amendments thereto with respect to fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, we believe that for the year 2018 all filing requirements were met on a timely basis. 
PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED 
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
During our 2018 Annual Meeting, we asked our shareholders to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay" vote. Approximately 97.7% of shareholder votes cast were in favor of our executive officer compensation program. We value the positive endorsement by our shareholders of our executive compensation policies and believe that the outcome signals our shareholders' support of our executive compensation program. As a result, our Compensation Committee decided to retain our general approach to named executive officer compensation, with an emphasis on performance-based short and long-term incentive compensation that rewards our most senior executives when they deliver value for our long-term shareholders. At our 2017 Annual Meeting, our shareholders voted in favor of holding our "Say-on-Pay" vote annually, which our Board subsequently approved. Our next shareholder vote on the frequency of our "Say-on-Pay" vote is expected to be held at our 2023 Annual Meeting. 
Nordson's consistent long-term shareholder value creation is attributed to a rigorously-applied management process implemented over the years by successive teams of talented and committed executives. Our executive compensation program underpins and reinforces this process and the performance it generates. We believe the program strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our executives to dedicate themselves fully to creating value for our shareholders. In support of this belief, and reflective of the Compensation Committee's diligent oversight of the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee urges you to consider the following factors:

PART I: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
2018 Financial Performance 
Fiscal year 2018 was a year of strong financial performance. The tables below present FY2016 – FY2018 reported results for the three primary drivers of incentive compensation for the named executive officers – Diluted Earnings per Share, Return on Total Capital, and Revenue. The Compensation Committee elected to exclude any financial benefits the Company received as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed in 2017. As a result, all calculations for executive compensation in this section, except for the graph below (see footnote), exclude the financial benefit to the Company as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Diluted Earnings per Share* Return on Total Capital* Revenue (Billions) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  This data includes the benefits inured to the Company from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed in 2017. The  Company's 2018 data, excluding the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and utilizing a more normalized effective tax rate, are: Diluted Earnings per Share is $5.70 and Return on Total Capital is 14%.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Objectives 
We provide a straightforward, uncomplicated compensation structure for our named executive officers, one which is designed to support three primary objectives:

[END TABLE]
Mr. Hilton's Compensation 
The compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hilton, is consistent with our "pay-for-performance" compensation philosophy that applies to all of our named executive officers. Considering Mr. Hilton's tenure, experience, and performance, his total target direct compensation approximates the 75th percentile of other chief executive officers in our peer group. Mr. Hilton's actual annual and long-term incentive awards are aligned with our earnings per share growth, return on total capital, and revenue growth. 
During its November 20, 2017 meeting, the Compensation Committee, with input from its independent executive compensation consultant, Exequity LLP, established Mr. Hilton's 2018 total target direct compensation, taking into account a number of factors, including a competitive market review, tenure and experience, relative internal pay equity, the Board's assessment of Mr. Hilton's multi-year performance, and the Company's overall financial and operating performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018 Compensation Element         Value   
   2018 Compensation Element         Value   
   2018 Compensation Element         Value   
   Base  Salary    $925,000 (5.7% increase over 2017) 
   Annual  Cash Incentive Award Target Opportunity    $925,000 (100% of base salary, same target percentage as 2017) 
   2018-2020 Performance Share Incentive Award   Target Opportunity     13,400 share units $1,654,230 grant date fair value 
   2018-2020 Performance Share Incentive Award   Target Opportunity     13,400 share units $1,654,230 grant date fair value 
   Stock  Options     55,800 shares $1,942,599 grant date fair value 
   Stock  Options     55,800 shares $1,942,599 grant date fair value 
   Restricted Shares     6,700 shares $855,389 grant date fair value 
[END TABLE]
The combination of target payout opportunity for the Annual Cash Incentive Award and Performance Share Incentive Award plus the grant date fair value of restricted share and stock option awards represented approximately 85% of Mr. Hilton's target total direct compensation for 2018, which further reinforces our pay-for-performance culture. 
During its November 26, 2018 meeting, shortly after our 2018 fiscal year ended, the Board reviewed Mr. Hilton's performance for 2018. In assessing Mr. Hilton's performance, the Board considered Mr. Hilton's impact on the Company's one-year operating plan and longer-term strategic plans. The Board concluded that Mr. Hilton delivered outstanding performance with respect to both his short and long-term goals. In particular, the Board noted the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's strong financial and operating performance, including achieving multiple record financial metrics, and  top percentile performance among the peer group companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Hilton's leadership of the Company, specifically the progress made toward strengthening the Company's  overall long-term growth profile through organic initiatives, acquisitions, and driving continuous improvement through the global organization; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued development and execution on senior leadership and management succession plans.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the Board's assessment and reflective of the performance noted above, the Compensation Committee, without Mr. Hilton present during its deliberations, and consistent with its "pay-for-performance" philosophy, took the following actions with respect to Mr. Hilton's 2018 incentive compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Incentive Award         Payout         Percent of Target   
   Incentive Award         Payout         Percent of Target

   2016-2018 Performance Share Incentive       34,095 shares(1)       185.3%   
   2016-2018 Performance Share Incentive       34,095 shares(1)       185.3%   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Settlement of the Performance Share Incentive Award occurred on January 3, 2019. Based on the closing price of our  common shares on January 3, 2019 ($112.76 per share), value of the payout in dollars was $3,844,552.  
[END TABLE]
Except for excluding the financial benefits the Company received from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, no discretion was exercised by the Compensation Committee to increase or decrease the formulaic incentive award payouts to Mr. Hilton. 
How Compensation Correlates to Performance 
Our executive compensation program is structured so that a significant portion of the compensation paid to our named executive officers is dependent upon the performance of our business. The program is not overly weighted toward cash incentive compensation and does not otherwise have the potential to threaten long-term shareholder value by promoting unnecessary or excessive risk-taking by our executive officers. 
For incentive compensation awards that are based on the Company's performance, our specific decisions setting performance measures and goals and other actions impacting executive compensation focus on certain areas that are tied directly to our business plan and are what we believe are the most critical value drivers of the business, such as revenue and earnings growth and return on total capital. 
The Annual Cash Incentive Award payout is tied to diluted earnings per share growth and return on total capital. The Performance Share Incentive Award payout is based on cumulative diluted earnings per share growth and cumulative revenue growth over a three-year period. The Performance Share Incentive Award payout is also impacted by share price performance, as the payout value (in dollars) is based on the settlement date share price.

We place significant emphasis on long-term growth in our share price, and believe the information provided in the graph and tables above to be important in understanding our compensation philosophy and its role in the achievement of our long-term objectives. 
PART II: SETTING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Role of the Shareholder Say-on-Pay Vote 
The Committee believes that the results of the advisory "say-on-pay" shareholder vote represent an affirmation of our current pay practices and philosophies and, as a result, no significant changes were made to our executive compensation pay practices for 2018. The Committee will continue to consider the outcome of the say-on-pay vote when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers. The results of our say-on-pay vote for the past five years are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Annual Meeting Year           FOR Vote (%)     
     Annual Meeting Year           FOR Vote (%)

 2016        98.97  
 2017        98.11  
 2018        97.70  
[END TABLE]
At the 2017 Annual Meeting, the Company's shareholders voted in favor of an annual frequency for holding our "say-on-pay" vote, which the Board subsequently approved. The next shareholder vote on the frequency of our advisory "say-on-pay" vote is expected to be held at our 2023 Annual Meeting. 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Committee is made up entirely of independent directors as defined by our Governance Guidelines and Nasdaq listing standards and has responsibility for establishing our executive compensation program and for making compensation decisions under the program. In fulfilling its duties and responsibilities for 2018, the Committee sought input, advice, and recommendations from an independent executive compensation consultant as well as recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hilton. At all times, however, the Compensation Committee exercised independent judgment in making executive compensation decisions. 
Role of the Executive Compensation Consultant 
The Committee retained Exequity LLP ("Exequity") as the executive compensation consultant reporting directly to the Committee. Exequity provides research, data analyses, survey information, and design expertise in developing compensation programs for our executive officers. In addition, Exequity informs the Committee of regulatory developments and market trends related to executive compensation practices. The Committee has assessed the independence of Exequity in light of SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards and concluded that no conflict of interest would prevent Exequity from independently and objectively advising the Committee. 
Role of Executive Management 
Mr. Hilton and Ms. Shelly Peet, Executive Vice President, Human Resources & Information Systems, provide additional information and analysis as requested by the Committee. More specifically, Mr. Hilton and Ms. Peet provided support for Committee meetings and made recommendations about designs for and, if warranted, changes to our Annual Cash Incentive Award and long-term equity-based awards. In addition to the responsibilities above, Mr. Hilton also: (a) provided to the Board of Directors a self-assessment of his performance for the fiscal year; (b) provided an assessment of each executive officer's performance; and (c) recommended annual base salary adjustments, payouts of Annual Cash Incentive Awards and Performance Share Incentive Awards, and equity awards for executive officers other than himself.

Setting Goals and Compensation 
In order to focus on delivering growth and value for shareholders over time and to communicate consistently with investors and other stakeholders, we take a longer term approach to incentive compensation wherein our incentive plan targets remain consistent for a multi-year period of time, which is more aligned with our five year strategic plan cycle. We annually assess measures and performance goals (threshold, target, and maximum) to validate they are set appropriately based on internal and external factors, such as historic peer performance, long-term growth projections for Nordson, our own past and current performance, and market conditions and expectations. 
The most heavily weighted component of our annual review of incentive goals is the historical performance of our peers, particularly our proxy peers, though we also review a group of mid-cap industrial peers for reference. For each corporate measure, we review the one-, three-, and five-year median performance of our peers in comparison to our performance goals. In general, if our performance goals fall outside a corridor around the median peer performance for two consecutive years, we further evaluate the appropriateness of our goals. 
Using two consecutive years outside our range of peer median performance for a metric as our guideline, we complete a full review to determine whether we should make a change. We look at additional internal and external data to develop our recommendation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nordson expected future performance based on our five-year strategic plan: This allows us to assess whether our future  expected performance continues to align with existing incentive targets and therefore would indicate that our goals should stay as-is, or whether our five-year plan expected performance projections are more in  line with the movement in peer performance, and suggest we consider an adjustment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nordson historic performance: Our historic performance is reviewed along with projected future performance to help us  assess whether we believe targets should be changed.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other external factors: Consideration of economic conditions, investor and shareholder expectations, pay for performance  alignment, and other factors also contribute to our final recommendation as to whether or not our target should be adjusted.  
[END TABLE]
Based on a qualitative analysis of all factors, and considering input from the independent executive compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee may change goals or to retain the targets currently in place. 
Peer Group and Compensation Surveys 
Our compensation peer group for 2018, which was developed in consultation with Exequity, consisted of the 18 publicly-traded companies listed below. The Committee believes the listed companies serve as the appropriate peer group because they have revenues generally within the range of 0.5x — 2.0x Nordson's revenue; a global scope and business complexity; a focus on precision industrial manufacturing; innovation and technology; global growth strategies; and profiles or business models similar to Nordson's, based on industries or diverse markets served. The Committee regularly reviews the peer group and makes appropriate modifications from time to time so that the group closely resembles our competitive market for executive talent.

Allocation of Executive Compensation 
Our executive compensation program does not prescribe a specific formula for the mix of base salary and annual and long-term incentive components so that we have flexibility in developing an appropriate compensation mix. The table below reflects the approximate allocation mix at target among the three elements of total target direct compensation — base salary, Annual Cash Incentive Award opportunity, and long-term equity-based incentive award opportunity — for our named executive officers at the time we set compensation for 2018: 
Hilton Thaxton KeaneMerkPembrokeLong-Term Incentive70.6%Annual Cash Incentive 14.7%Base Salary 14.7%56.2%18.0%25.8%56.9%17.7%25.3%51.8%19.0%29.2%49.6%19.9%30.6% 
85% of the total direct compensation for Mr. Hilton and approximately 69% - 75% for the other named executive officers is delivered through awards that link pay to financial and operational performance. Incentive payouts under our Annual Cash Incentive Award are based on growth in diluted earnings per share, return on capital, and operating unit results. Equity-based compensation consists of performance share units, non-qualified stock options, and service-based restricted shares, all of which align compensation with the long-term interests of our shareholders. 
PART III: KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
The table below summarizes the components and objectives of our 2018 compensation program for executive officers, including our named executive officers, and the actions taken by the Compensation Committee relative to each component.

2018 Actions and Analysis 
Considering Exequity's input and analysis and the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, we set individual base salaries of our named executive officers for 2018 at a level consistent with the general objective of paying total target direct compensation to approximate the median of our peer group; however, each executive officer's position relative to median may vary depending on a consideration of factors such as tenure, experience, future potential, internal pay equity, and performance. 
The following table reflects the annualized base salaries of our named executive officers for 2018 and 2017 (year-end):

• Return on total capital measures the amount of profitability per unit of capital invested by management to generate  earnings. We have adopted a definition of return on total capital that is consistent with financial disclosure in our Report on Form 10-K: the sum of net income (loss) plus  after-tax interest expense on debt as a percentage of the sum of average of quarterly debt (net of cash) plus average quarterly shareholders' equity over five accounting periods.  
[END TABLE]
For named executive officers that have responsibility for certain corporate functions (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), the corporate financial measures account for 50% of any payout with a weighted average of the business unit quantitative operating measures accounting for the other 50% of the payout. For the operating unit named executive officers, the corporate financial measures account for 50% of any payout with the respective operating unit's quantitative operating measures accounting for the other 50% of the payout. 
Effect of Currency Fluctuation 
The Committee, after considering a number of factors, including peer and survey group practices and receiving input from Exequity, has determined that management should be held accountable for some, but not all, of the effect of currency fluctuation on corporate financial and operating unit performance results. Accordingly, in determining Annual Cash Incentive Award payouts, the Committee adopted a policy whereby management will be held accountable for the first 10% of the impact on payouts due to currency fluctuation. Under the policy, payout rates (as a percent of target) for the Annual Cash Incentive Award are calculated at actual foreign currency rates and currency neutral rates for the U.S. Dollar during the fiscal year. The difference between total payout rates under these two translation methods is all currency related, and the Committee has determined that the first 10% of this difference should not affect final payouts. The final payout includes a currency adjustment equal to the difference between these two payout rates less 10%, which represents a corridor or range of fluctuation in currency rates for which management is accountable. We believe this policy is appropriate because it requires management to respond to currency fluctuations within a specified range. However, it does not unfairly benefit or harm management if currency impact is beyond what may be considered normal and not under management's control. 
As an example of the policy in practice, if the difference between the two payout percentage rates is equal to or less than +/- 10 percentage points, the Annual Cash Incentive Award payout will be based on the calculation at actual currency rates, with no adjustment. When the payout percentage at actual currency rates is more than 10 percentage points lower than the payout percentage rate at currency neutral rates, the final payout will be based on the currency neutral calculation adjusted downward by 10 percentage points. Conversely, when the payout percentage rate at actual currency rates is more than 10 percentage points higher than the payout percentage rate at currency neutral rates, the final payout rate will be based on the currency neutral calculation adjusted upward by 10 percentage points. 
Foreign Currency Translation Methodology 
For purposes of applying the currency adjustment policy, current year financial statements and supplemental schedules are retranslated at prior year exchange rates using the same methodology as disclosed in Note 1 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our Form 10-K for 2018 to determine the currency neutral result, with the exception that we do not attempt to re-measure gains and losses, based on a retranslation at prior year exchange rates, from foreign currency transactions, including forward contracts, of Nordson's subsidiaries and the United States parent, in order to include the effect in net income. All currency rates are determined from published sources. Monthly average rates are the average of daily spot rates of currency exchange. The annual measurement period is the sum of each month translated at monthly average rates.

Determining Payout Amounts 
Determination of the Annual Cash Incentive Award payout is a two-step process: 
Step 1: Calculation of the Payout Rate (as a% of Target) on an Actual Currency and Currency Neutral Basis 
Prior to applying the currency adjustment policy described above, the Committee first certified performance and calculated payouts as a percentage of target for the corporate financial measures: 
Actual Currency — Performance Unadjusted for Effect of Currency Fluctuation, and 
Currency Neutral — Performance Adjusted for Effect of Currency Fluctuation 
The results are reflected in the following table:

Step 2: Calculation of Payouts to Named Executive Officers Applying the Currency Adjustment Policy 
For named executive officers who have responsibility for certain corporate functions (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), the corporate financial measures account for 50% of any payout with a weighted average of the business unit quantitative operating measures accounting for the other 50% of the payout. For the operating unit named executive officers, the corporate financial measures account for 50% of any payout with the respective operating unit's quantitative operating measures accounting for the other 50% of the payout.

Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Our long-term incentive awards are delivered through a combination of three forms of equity: (i) incentive-based performance share units; (ii) stock options; and (iii) service-based restricted shares. This combination of awards balances the opportunity between performance share units, which are earned based on multi-year financial performance, and stock options and restricted shares, the value of which is based on performance of our common shares. 
The Committee begins the process of determining equity awards by comparing our equity compensation programs to those of our peer group. The Committee also reviews market compensation data based on survey data provided by Aon Hewitt. 
In reaching a final decision on the mix and amount of equity compensation our named executive officers should receive, the Committee takes numerous factors into consideration. As referenced above, market alignment and competitiveness are key factors the Committee considers in setting equity compensation levels. Other factors considered are current industry trends, practices among our peer group, and the behaviors the awards are intended to drive. In addition to these factors, the Committee places significant weight on the dilutive impact equity issuances have on our shareholders. In assessing dilution, the Committee considers the annualized effect of equity compensation by analyzing the equity "burn rate" over one- and three-year periods. Burn rate, in its simplest form, is determined by dividing the projected number of shares to be issued to employees by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Committee also considers the aggregate impact of all past equity compensation grants by looking at the company's equity compensation "overhang." Overhang is determined by dividing all outstanding equity grants and shares available for future grants by the total number of shares outstanding. The resulting percentage provides the Committee with insight into the long-term cost of the Company's equity compensation programs. 
Approximate allocation of the three equity components (as a percent of the long-term incentive compensation opportunity) is as follows:

Performance Share Incentive Award 
A portion of each named executive officer's total direct compensation opportunity is in the form of performance share units which are settled in unrestricted Nordson Common Stock at time of payout. 
Purpose 
The purpose of the Performance Share Incentive Award is to drive high-performance results over a longer period (three years) based on the achievement of pre-established quantitative performance goals which focus our executives on key business strategies and align the interests of our executive officers with our long-term shareholders. Executive officers are provided the opportunity to earn a significantly higher payout if target performance is exceeded but bear the risk of a lower payout if target performance is not achieved, and no payout if threshold performance is not achieved.

Measures and Goals 
In selecting the quantitative performance measures and goals, the Committee considers whether the measures are appropriately aligned with those in the Annual Cash Incentive Award so that the overall compensation design does not unintentionally encourage our executive officers to take unnecessary or excessive risk or actions that are inconsistent with our year-over-year and long-term objectives. Performance and payouts under the Performance Share Incentive Award are determined based on quantitative corporate financial measures — cumulative diluted earnings per share growth and cumulative revenue growth. We believe these measures offer the proper balance between growth and profitability over a longer term. More specifically: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cumulative diluted earnings per share growth measures the rate at which management has succeeded in growing profits on a  sustained basis over a three-year period. We believe it is the constant percentage by which diluted earnings per share would need to grow over a base period amount during a three-year period such that the sum of diluted earnings per share calculated  at such a constant growth rate for such three years is equal to the sum of the actual diluted earnings per share earned over the same three-year period. We believe it is a superior measure of sustained earnings growth because it is influenced by the  earnings performance during each year of the performance period rather than simply a compound growth rate that compares the final year's earnings to the base period amount.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cumulative revenue growth measures the rate at which management has succeeded in growing revenue on a sustained basis over  a three-year period. We believe it is the constant percentage by which revenue would need to grow over a base period amount during a three-year period such that the sum of revenue growth calculated at such a constant growth rate for such three years  is equal to the sum of the actual revenue growth over the same three-year period. We believe it is a superior measure of sustained revenue growth because it is influenced by revenue performance during each year of the performance period rather than  simply a compound growth rate that compares the final year's revenues to the base period amount. While the growth in profits and profitability are of primary importance, management is also expected to grow the size and scale of the enterprise  and cumulative revenue growth is an effective measure of their success in doing so.  
[END TABLE]
As noted above, the Compensation Committee voted to exclude from the executive compensation analysis, including calculation of the 2018 long term incentive awards, all financial benefits the Company received as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017. 
Effect of Foreign Currency Fluctuation 
The Committee has determined that the currency adjustment policy described in the "Annual Cash Incentive Award" section above should also apply to the determination of Performance Share Incentive Award payouts.

In certifying the results for the financial performance measures employed in calculating the Performance Share Incentive Award, the Committee applies the same methodology described in the "Annual Cash Incentive Award" section above, with the revenue and earnings per share at currency neutral rates reflecting the cumulative effect of differences from actual exchange rates over the three-year versus one-year performance period. 
2018 Actions and Analysis 
During its November 23, 2015 meeting, the Committee established quantitative performance measures and goals for the 2016-2018 Performance Share Incentive Award. These measures are equally-weighted.

[END TABLE]
Step 1: Calculation of the Payout Rate (as a% of Target) on an Actual Currency and Currency Neutral Basis 
Prior to applying the Currency Adjustment Policy described above, the Committee first certified performance for the Cumulative Earnings per Share Growth and Cumulative Revenue measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Actual Currency – performance unadjusted for the effect of currency fluctuation, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Currency Neutral – performance adjusted for the effect of currency fluctuation.  
[END TABLE]
Following this certification process, the Committee calculated the payouts as a percent of target. The results are reflected in the following table:

Step 2: Calculation of Payouts to Named Executive Officers Applying the Currency Adjustment Policy 
Under the currency adjustment policy, because the difference between the two payout percentage rates is equal to or less than +/- 10 percentage points, the final payouts for the 2016-2018 performance period are based on the calculation at actual currency rates, with no adjustments:

Restricted Shares 
Restricted shares are designed to align executive officers' interest with that of our long-term shareholders. The Committee also views these service-based awards as an important management succession planning, retention, and recognition tool, tying our executive officers' compensation to the goal of increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. Restricted shares generally will vest over a three-year period and cannot be transferred until vesting. Restricted shares provide participants with dividends and voting rights beginning on the grant date. 
We granted restricted shares to executive officers on November 20, 2017. The share price on the grant date was the closing price on November 20, 2017 – $127.67. The following table provides information regarding the 2018 restricted share awards:

In addition to base salary, the Annual Cash Incentive Award, and long-term equity-based incentive awards, we offer other forms of compensation, including: (i) executive perquisites; (ii) welfare and retirement benefits; and (iii) change-in-control benefits. 
Executive Perquisites 
We provide limited and modest perquisites to each of our executive officers to promote the business objectives described below. We also use these perquisites to provide a competitive executive compensation program, which allows us to attract and retain top executive talent. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business Clubs.    We do not reimburse any executive officer for fees or dues associated with  personal country club memberships. We reimburse Mr. Hilton for one private business club membership to encourage entertainment of business colleagues and customers, engaging in social interaction with peers from other companies, local  leadership in the community, and holding business meetings at a convenient offsite location. In addition, we provide all executive officers with memberships in up to two airline travel clubs that allow them to be more productive when traveling on  commercial airlines.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial, Estate, and Tax Planning and Preparation.    We pay for financial, estate, and tax  planning and preparation fees and expenses. The maximum amount is $5,000 for each named executive officer per calendar year. We provide this perquisite to assist our executive officers in obtaining financial counseling, enabling them to concentrate  on business matters rather than on personal financial planning.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive Physicals.    We pay for annual physicals for our executive officers. We provide this  benefit to preserve our investment in our executive officers by encouraging them to maintain healthy lifestyles and be proactive in their preventative healthcare.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relocation Expense Reimbursement.    We maintain a general relocation policy under which the  Company provides reimbursement for certain relocation expenses to new employees and to employees whose job function requires relocation. We believe it is important to maintain market competitive relocation benefits in order to fill positions that  are critical to Nordson's business needs.

Severance Agreements 
Mr. Hilton is the only executive for which we have any obligation to pay severance other than following a change-in-control. As part of the negotiated employment agreement with Mr. Hilton and consistent with an agreement we had with his predecessor, we agreed to provide Mr. Hilton with a cash severance and other benefits in the event his employment is terminated by us without "Cause" or Mr. Hilton terminates his employment with us for "Good Reason" (each such term as defined in Mr. Hilton's employment agreement). 
Upon a termination by us without Cause or by Mr. Hilton for Good Reason, in addition to payment of any accrued and unpaid compensation and benefits, Mr. Hilton is entitled to post-termination payments and benefits as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of his annual base salary and the greater of (x) ninety percent  (90%) of his annual base salary or (y) his target cash incentive opportunity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  53 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro-rata payout of his Annual Cash Incentive Award, based on actual performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro-rata payout of long-term performance share awards granted to Mr. Hilton  for any performance period(s) not completed on the date of termination, based upon actual performance in each such applicable performance period, as determined at the end of the applicable performance period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• full vesting of restricted share awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continuation of health care and welfare benefits for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date of  termination.  
[END TABLE]
We will not gross-up any tax imposed upon any payment received by Mr. Hilton under his employment agreement. 
Change-in-Control 
We believe that the occurrence, or potential occurrence, of a change-in-control transaction in which we are the target could create substantial uncertainty regarding the continued employment of our executive officers. Therefore, we have entered into change-in-control retention agreements with our executive officers that provide severance and other benefits in the event of a qualifying termination following a change-in-control. The primary purpose of these agreements is to keep senior executives focused on pursuing all corporate transaction activity that is in the best interests of shareholders, regardless of whether those transactions may result in their own job loss. The Committee has determined that change-in-control retention agreements executed after November 1, 2015 will not provide for "gross-up" payments to cover any federal excise taxes that may be owed on change-in-control severance payments and benefits. Change-in-control retention agreements executed prior to November 1, 2015, which do provide for a gross-up for any excess federal excise taxes that may be owed on change in control-related severance payments and benefits, remain in effect. 
Severance and Other Benefits 
Severance benefits payable under change-in-control retention agreements are conditioned upon the occurrence of a "double trigger" event (meaning there must be both a change-in-control of the Company and, within the following 24 months, a termination of employment by either the Company without Cause, or by the officer for Good Reason, as defined in the respective change-in-control retention agreements). We opted for a double-trigger, rather than a "single trigger" that provides for severance payments solely on the basis of a change-in-control, since a double trigger is consistent with the purpose of encouraging the continued employment of the executive following a change-in-control. 
In the event of a change-in-control and a qualifying termination of employment, an executive officer will be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued but unpaid compensation, including a pro-rata payout of the Annual Cash  Incentive Award;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (x) annual base salary in effect at the time of  termination of employment plus (y) target Annual Cash Incentive Award opportunity for the year in which termination of employment occurs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continuation of coverage for the executive officer and his or her eligible spouse and dependents under the Company's  group health plans for 24 months following termination of employment or until the date he or she becomes covered under similar benefit plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• professional outplacement services; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• two additional years of age and two additional years of service credit under the Company-sponsored qualified and non-qualified pension plans, the benefit being paid from the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Treatment of Share-based Awards 
To provide our executive officers with the same opportunity as our shareholders to realize the value created by a change-in-control, the shareholder-approved Amended and Restated 2012 Nordson Corporation Share and Incentive Award Plan historically has provided for full vesting of all outstanding share-based Awards upon a change-in-control. However, effective for awards granted under that plan after December 27, 2017, equity awards generally will vest on a "double-trigger" basis, in the event of a change-in-control and a qualifying termination of the participant's employment.

PART V: POLICIES RELATED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Equity Award Policy 
We grant equity on a consistent schedule, generally at the first Committee meeting following the end of the fiscal year. We do not grant performance share units, stock options, or restricted shares to our executive officers in anticipation of the release of significant earnings announcements or other material non-public information likely to result in changes to the price of our common shares. Similarly, we do not time the release of material non-public information based on equity award grant dates. Awards generally are effective on the date that we grant the award. The Committee may also make occasional grants of stock options and other equity-based awards at other times to recognize, retain or recruit executive officers and key employees. We have delegated limited authority to Mr. Hilton to grant equity awards, excluding awards made to executive officers. Equity awards granted by Mr. Hilton in any quarter will be effective the first day of the month following public disclosure of quarterly earnings for that quarter. 
Incentive Compensation Forfeiture (Clawback) Policy 
We have a formal "clawback" policy for incentive awards that is broader in its reach than that imposed by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under the policy, we may require our executive officers to repay cash-based incentive compensation and/or equity incentive awards in the event of a material restatement of the consolidated financial statements of the Company, other than any restatement required pursuant to a change in applicable accounting rules. Recovery is limited to amounts paid or realized by an executive officer during the three-year period preceding the date that we are required to prepare a restatement. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors, upon the Committee's recommendation, may, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent it determines that it is in our best interests to do so, require reimbursement or payment by the executive officer to the Company of equity-based compensation and performance-based compensation in an amount determined by the Board of Directors to be attributable to: (i) conduct that violates our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, or (ii) willful misconduct or fraud that causes harm to the Company. 
The Committee will revise the policy as appropriate once final rules are issued under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
We require share ownership by our executive officers to emphasize our executive compensation program's objective of aligning the individual financial interests of our executive officers with the investment interests of our long-term shareholders. We require our executive officers to own the following multiples of base salary in the equivalent number of common shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive  Officer    5 times base salary   
 President (other than the Chief Executive Officer)       3  times base salary   
 President (other than the Chief Executive Officer)       3  times base salary   
 Other Executive Officers     2 times base salary     
 Other Executive Officers     2 times base salary     
[END TABLE]
Executive officers who have not satisfied the share ownership requirements by the end of the five-year period or who have not shown progress (as subjectively determined by the Committee) toward the required ownership level prior to the end of such five-year period will be expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired through exercise of options, lapse of transfer restrictions on restricted shares or 
 Performance Share Incentive Award payouts, net of shares withheld to cover the taxes due, until the share ownership requirement is achieved or there is progress towards the ownership requirement. We review the share ownership of each executive officer compared to the applicable share ownership guidelines, including the number of vested stock options, share equivalent units in deferred compensation plans and share ownership in the Nordson Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan and 401(k) Plan, each of which count as valid forms of share ownership under the ownership guidelines. As of October 31, 2018, all named executive officers, except Jeffrey Pembroke, met or exceeded their respective ownership guidelines. Mr. Pembroke was named an executive officer in November 2015 and is required to meet the share ownership requirement by November 2020. 
Anti-Pledging/Anti-Hedging Policy 
We prohibit directors and executive officers from pledging Nordson common shares as collateral. Also prohibited are trading in derivative securities of Nordson's common shares, engaging in short sales of Nordson securities, or purchasing any other financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Nordson securities. 
Tax and Accounting Treatment of Executive Compensation 
The Committee takes into account the tax and accounting treatment of executive compensation arrangements when structuring our executive compensation program. One of those considerations is Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which sets a limit of $1 million on the amount we can deduct for compensation paid to our "covered employees". Historically, compensation meeting the requirements of "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) did not count toward the $1 million limit. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, made a number of changes to Section 162(m), generally effective for taxable (fiscal) years beginning after December 31, 2017, including the repeal of the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption and the expansion of the definition of "covered employees" (for example, by including both the chief financial officer and certain former named executive officers as covered employees). 
Our general philosophy has been to attempt to qualify compensation for tax deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, wherever we deem appropriate, recognizing that, under certain circumstances, the limitations may be exceeded. Historically, treatment as "qualified performance-based compensation" has been sought to the extent practicable and only to the extent that it is consistent with our overall compensation objectives. However, due to uncertainties regarding the scope of relief under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there can be no guarantee that any compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of $1 million will be or remain exempt from Section 162(m). 
In any event, the Committee retains full discretion to construct compensation packages that will best attract, retain, and reward successful executive officers. Therefore, the Committee may award compensation that is not fully deductible under Section 162(m) if the Committee believes it will contribute to the achievement of our business objectives. Moreover, given the nature of the changes to Section 162(m) under the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Compensation Committee expects that, after Nordson's 2018 fiscal year, the tax-deductible portion of our executive compensation program will decrease.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
We have reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that appears in this Proxy Statement. Based on such review and discussion, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A and incorporated by reference into the Company's 2018 Annual Report, each as filed with the SEC. 
Compensation Committee, 
Mary G. Puma, Chair 
Lee C. Banks 
Michael J. Merriman, Jr. 
Victor L. Richey, Jr. 
January 18, 2019 
The above Compensation Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C (other than as provided in Item 407 of Regulation S-K) or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically requests that the information in this Report be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act. If this Report is incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, such disclosure will be furnished in such Annual Report on Form 10-K and will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act as a result of furnishing the disclosure in this manner. 
RISKS RELATED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES 
The Committee believes that the design of the executive compensation program as outlined in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above places emphasis on long-term incentives and competitive base salaries. While the Annual Cash Incentive Award is tied to short-term performance, the Committee concluded that emphasis on long-term incentives appropriately balances risk and management's motivations for our long-term success, including share price performance, with the interests of our long-term shareholders. Although our executive compensation program is designed to pay-for-performance and provide incentive-based compensation, the incentive-driven elements of our executive compensation program contain various mitigating features that are designed to discourage management from taking unnecessary risks in managing the business that could maximize short-term results at the expense of long-term value. 
The Committee has the authority to set performance measures and goals, monitor performance, and to exercise negative discretion in determining incentive award payouts to our executive officers. 
We believe that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage our executive officers to take excessive or unnecessary risks and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
The table below summarizes the risk mitigation factors applicable to the primary elements of the Company's executive compensation program.

   Share Ownership Guidelines.    Share ownership guidelines align the executive interests with those of our  long-term shareholders.   Vesting Schedule  Overlaps.

• Performance Share Incentive Awards — The Compensation Committee establishes performance  share incentive awards for executive officers based on three-year cumulative performance measures. The award is in the form of performance share units which are settled in unrestricted Nordson common shares on a one-for-one basis or share equivalent units on a one-for-one basis for payouts that are deferred. The payout will vary based  upon the actual level of performance over a three-year period. However, the threshold performance level must be achieved before any payout is made. These awards are referred to in the following table as "PSIA."

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Share Awards — Restricted shares are awarded subject to restrictions on  transferability. The shares may be voted but not sold or transferred during the restriction period. Cash dividends are paid on the restricted shares during the restriction period. Restricted shares vest on a  pro-rata basis annually each year for three years following the date of award. These awards are referred to in the following table as "RS."

• Stock Option Awards — Stock options have a term of ten years, become exercisable over a  four-year period at the rate of 25% per year beginning one year from the grant date, and have an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. Under the terms of award, the exercise price and tax-withholding obligations may be paid with previously owned common shares or with shares acquired upon exercise. Information with respect to each of these awards on an award-by-award basis is set forth in the table below. These awards are referred to in the following table as "Options."

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• measurement date of October 31;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each participant's benefit commences at age 65, the age at which retirement may occur without any age-based reduction in benefits, discounted to October 31, 2018 using a discount rate of 3.57%;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the benefits are payable as a single life annuity; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• post-retirement mortality based on the RP2006 Fully Generational Mortality Table for Healthy Employees projected with  mortality improvements by Scale MP2016.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  For the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the calculation of the present value of the accumulated benefit for Messrs.  Hilton, Thaxton, Keane, and Merk assumes that each participant's benefit is payable as a lump sum commencing at age 65, the age at which retirement may occur without any age-based reduction in benefits,  discounted to October 31, 2018 using a discount rate of 3.57%, a lump sum interest rate of 2.88% and post-retirement mortality based on the life expectancy under IRC regulation 1.401(a)(9)-9.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Mr. Merk became a participant in the Salaried Employees Pension Plan and the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan  effective February 1, 2013. He receives benefit service credit for his service prior to February 1, 2013 with Nordson under the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Salaried Employees Pension Plan 
We sponsor the Nordson Corporation Salaried Employees Pension Plan (the "Salaried Employees Pension Plan"), a defined benefit pension plan for our U.S.-based salaried employees, including our U.S.-based named executive officers. Benefits under the pension plan are based on a "final average pay," which means the monthly average of the highest aggregate compensation (base salary and cash incentive payment) for 60 months of the 120 most recent consecutive months prior to retirement. Compensation used to determine benefits under the Salaried Employees Pension Plan may not exceed the limit under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Normal retirement age under the Salaried Employees Pension Plan is age 65. Employees who retire on or after age 55 may begin receiving their benefit immediately but experience a reduction in the benefit for every month prior to age 65 that the benefit begins. Employees become 100% vested in their benefit at the earlier of age 65, or after five years of service. The benefits are further reduced by benefits received under the Social Security program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  69 
[END TABLE]
If the employee dies prior to receiving the vested benefit, the surviving spouse, if any, will receive a 50% survivor annuity for the rest of the surviving spouse's life. Benefits under the Salaried Employees Pension Plan become payable on the first of the month following retirement, absent any election by a participant to commence the payment of benefits at a different time. Benefits are payable in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Life Only Annuity.    If a participant is not married or has been married less than 12 months  when payments begin and does not elect an optional payment method, he or she will receive the full amount of his or her benefit in equal monthly installments for the rest of his or her life. Payments begin on the first of the month following the  retirement date. After death, no additional payments are made.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% Joint & Survivor Annuity.    If a participant is married for  at least 12 months when payments begin, he or she will receive his or her benefit as a 50% Joint & Survivor Annuity, absent election of (and spousal consent for) an optional payment form. Under this option, a participant will receive a  reduced monthly benefit during his or her lifetime. After the participant's death, his or her spouse receives a benefit equal to 50% of the monthly benefit the participant was receiving. If the spouse dies before the participant, but after the  participant begins receiving payments, the participant will continue to receive the same benefit amount during his or her lifetime and no additional payments are made after death.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 100% (or 75%) Joint & Survivor Annuity.    A participant will  receive a reduced lifetime benefit under this option. The participant names a beneficiary and chooses the percentage of his or her benefit to continue to that individual after the participant's death. After death, the beneficiary receives the  percentage of benefit elected (100% or 75%) for the remainder of his or her life. The participant's age at the date the benefit commences, the beneficiary's age, and the percentage elected to continue after death affect the amount of the  benefit received during the participant's lifetime.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 10 Year Certain Annuity.    A participant will receive a reduced lifetime benefit in  equal monthly installments with payments guaranteed for at least ten years under this option. Payments continue for the rest of the participant's life even if he or she lives longer than the period of time elected. However, if the participant  receives less than 120 payments before death, the same monthly benefit continues to the beneficiary until the combined total number of installment payments are made.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Level Income Option.    This option allows a participant to receive an increased monthly payment  from the pension plan initially if a participant retires early and begins receiving payments from the pension plan before he or she is eligible for Social Security benefits. After Social Security benefits begin, the monthly payment from the pension  plan is reduced. This option does not provide any survivor benefit and, therefore, no benefit is payable after death.  
[END TABLE]
Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan 
We also sponsor an Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan for our U.S.-based executive officers. This plan is a non-tax qualified supplemental defined benefit plan designed to work in conjunction with the Salaried Employees Pension Plan. The pension benefit outlined above for the Salaried Employees Pension Plan is calculated as if there were no compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. Then, the maximum benefit allowable is paid out under the Salaried Employees Pension Plan and the balance is paid out under the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan. In addition to the benefit payout alternatives under the Salaried Employees Pension Plan, our executive officers may under the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan elect a lump sum payout of the benefit following termination of employment. 
Benefits under the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan are unsecured and are payable from our general assets. Payments will be delayed if and to the extent payment within six months of the termination of employment will result in the imposition of additional taxes on the executive officer pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Payments delayed due to Section 409A rules will accrue interest during the deferral period at the 10-year Treasury bill rate in effect on the first business day of the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan year in which the delayed payment period commences.

Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the Amended and Restated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan, our executive officers may elect to defer up to 100% of their base pay and Annual Cash Incentive Award payout, and 90% of their Performance Share Incentive Award payout each year. An executive officer may elect to invest in a number of investment accounts designated by the Compensation Committee, including an account comprised of units of our common shares. The cash investment accounts mirror the investment funds and investment returns provided under our qualified defined contribution 401(k) Plan, although the plans are not linked. The number of units credited to the share unit account is based on the closing price of our common shares on the day the share units are credited to the account and includes additional share units credited for quarterly dividends paid on our common shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  71 
[END TABLE]
Distributions are made in either a lump sum or installments based upon the executive officer's annual election. An executive officer may elect to receive payment in the form of a single lump sum or periodic payments over a period of 5, 10, or 15 years. No later than 12 months prior to a distribution, an executive officer may make an election to change the payment date or form of payment, provided that the distribution occurs at least 5 years after the original date of distribution previously elected by the executive officer. 
The Internal Revenue Code places limits on amounts that "highly compensated employees," such as our executive officers, may contribute to 401(k) plans. Correspondingly, because of these limits, matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan accounts of our executive officers in 2018 were limited. In order to restore any matching contribution amount that may have been forgone by our executive officers because of this limitation, we provide executive officers the opportunity to capture this potentially lost match in the deferred compensation plan. This restoration match is made to the executive officers who defer at least a minimum portion of their base salary. 
For all distributions, cash will be paid with respect to the cash accounts and our common shares will be issued equal to the number of share units in the executive officer's share equivalent unit account. Upon an executive officer's death, payment of any balance in a deferral account will be made to a designated beneficiary. 
In order to permit deferrals and payouts that comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, we adopted the 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan effective for deferrals by the executive officers after January 1, 2005. On December 10, 2008, the Compensation Committee adopted the Amended and Restated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan to bring the plan into compliance with final rules issued under Section 409A. 
The investment options and respective returns under the Amended and Restated 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for 2016, 2017 and 2018 were as follows:

(1)  A disability benefit is payable under the long-term disability plan under a group life insurance policy. Any amounts due  to an executive officer above the maximum disability payment provided by the policy ($25,000 per month) would be paid from our general assets. In the event of the Chief Executive Officer's death, the surviving spouse will be entitled to:  (a) a life insurance benefit equal to two times the sum of her or his annual base salary and target Annual Cash Incentive Award for the fiscal year in which the death occurs; (b) continued health benefits for 2 years; and (c) a pro-rated amount of the Chief Executive Officer's Annual Cash Incentive Award for the fiscal year of death based upon actual performance in such fiscal year, as determined at the end of the applicable  performance period. In the event of the Chief Executive Officer's termination of employment due to disability when she or he is age 65 or older or a termination due to retirement, the Chief Executive Officer shall receive a $12,000 Company-paid  retiree life insurance benefit.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  We have no contractual obligation to provide severance payments or benefits to an executive officer whose employment is  terminated without cause, other than with respect to Mr. Hilton under his employment agreement. Severance benefits due to Mr. Hilton in the event of a termination without cause or a resignation for good reason are discussed under the  caption "Severance Agreements" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis of this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
If any negotiated severance arrangement were entered into between us and an executive officer for severance payments, we would require the executive officer to sign a general release and waiver of claims against us and would typically require compliance with confidentiality and non-compete restrictions. Any agreed-upon severance payment will be subject to delay in the commencement of payments required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
"Cause" and "Good Reason" are discussed in the "Severance Agreement" section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  A change-in-control occurs if and when:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a report is filed with the SEC on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor  schedule, form, or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, disclosing that any "person" (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes a  beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of our then outstanding securities eligible to vote for the election of the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• during any period of 24 consecutive months, individuals who, at the beginning of such  24-month period were our directors, which we refer to as the incumbent board, cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors, unless the election, or nomination for election, of any person  becoming a director subsequent to the beginning of such 24-month period was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all or substantially all of our assets are sold in a single transaction or a series of related transactions to a single  purchaser or a group of affiliated purchasers; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we are merged or consolidated with another corporation and, as a result, securities representing less than 50% of the  combined voting power of the surviving or resulting corporation's securities (or of the securities of a parent corporation in case of a merger in which the surviving or resulting corporation becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent  corporation) are owned in the aggregate by holders of our securities immediately prior to such merger or consolidation.  
[END TABLE]
Upon a change-in-control, all outstanding equity compensation awards vest immediately. Unlike the "double trigger" discussed above, no termination of employment is required for the accelerated vesting of the awards. This "single-trigger" vesting provides our named executive officers with the same opportunity as our shareholders to realize the value created by the transaction. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  Vested options may be exercised for the life of the option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  Vested options may be exercised for the earlier of (a) five (5) years following retirement date or (b) the life  of the option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(8)  Effective November 1, 2015, we have eliminated gross up payments on any severance benefits for tax purposes.   
[END TABLE]
Enhanced Payments and Benefits Assuming Termination as of October 31, 2018 
The following table reflects the estimated value of enhanced payments and benefits that the named executive officers would receive under various termination scenarios assuming that all listed events occurred as of the last business day of fiscal year 2018 – October 31, 2018. 
In estimating the amounts reflected in the following table, we also applied the following general assumptions and principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No amounts for 2018 base salary or payouts under the 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Award and 2016-2018 Performance Share  Incentive Award are included in the following tables because the amounts are already earned as of October 31, 2018 and are not enhanced by any of the triggering events;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amounts were calculated based on each named executive officer's age, compensation, and years of service as of  October 31, 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of our common shares on October 31, 2018 was $122.67 per share;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Unvested stock options that vest were valued at an amount per share equal to the difference between $122.67 and the grant  date share price for each of the stock options on the grant date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No amounts were included for account balances in our qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan because this plan is  available to all U.S.-based salaried employees who have worked the minimum amount of hours required to receive this benefit;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No amounts were included for balances in a named executive officers' deferred compensation account. Fiscal year-end deferred account balances are reported in the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of benefits and payments that are generally available to all employees on a  non-discriminatory basis are not included;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of performance share units for termination other than voluntary termination or termination due to cause was  determined using payout at target performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of restricted shares subject to accelerated vesting is based on shares outstanding as of October 31, 2018 as  shown in the Outstanding Equity Awards table. Value is determined by multiplying the number of shares by the closing price of our common shares on October 31, 2018 – $122.67 per share;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• None of the named executive officers is qualified to receive an age 65 retirement pension benefit as of October 31,  2018. The actuarial present value of the deferred vested benefit under our Salaried Employees Pension Plan for each named executive officer may be found in the Pension Benefits table; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Calculation of post-termination payout of the Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan assumes a lump sum payout. Other  assumptions used in the calculation are noted in footnote 1 to the Pension Benefits table. The payout amount in the event of a qualifying termination following a  change-in-control reflects an additional two years of age and two years of service, up to a maximum age 65 and 30 years of service.

CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information with respect to our last completed fiscal year. The pay ratio information provided below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
In determining the pay ratio information provided above, we first identified our median employee for the 2018 fiscal year by using the following methodology, assumptions, adjustments, and estimates, as permitted by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We selected September 1, 2018 as the date upon which we would identify our median employee, and, from our tax and payroll records, we compiled a list of all full-time and part-time employees, excluding the CEO, who were employed on that date. We did not exclude any employees located outside the United States. We used total target cash compensation (base salary and annual cash incentive) as the consistently applied compensation measure for all employees. Sorting the list based on this measure, we selected our median employee. 
Once our median employee was identified in the manner described above, we calculated the annual total compensation of the median employee using the same methodology that we used to determine the annual total compensation of the CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. The annual total compensation our median employee, excluding the CEO, was $61,750. The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 61 of this Proxy Statement, was $6,997,090; and the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 113.3 to 1. 
The pay ratio disclosure rules of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K provide reporting companies with flexibility in determining the methodology used to identify the median employee, in calculating the median employee's annual total compensation and in estimating the ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees. As such, our methodology may differ materially from the methodology used by other companies to prepare their pay ratio disclosures, which, along with differences in employee populations, geographic locations, business strategies and compensation practices, may contribute to a lack of comparability between our pay ratio and the pay ratio reported by other companies, including those within our industry.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
January 18, 2019 
To: The Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation 
The Audit Committee consists solely of independent Directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards. The Audit Committee oversees Nordson's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Nordson's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is responsible for performing an integrated audit of Nordson's annual consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the year in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The Committee operates under a written charter that specifies the Committee's responsibilities. The full text of the Committee's Charter is available at: www.nordson.com/en/our-company/investors/annual-reports-and-presentations. The Audit Committee members are not auditors and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management and the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Management has the responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Committee discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Committee under PCAOB Auditing Standard 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. In addition, the Committee has received and discussed with Ernst & Young LLP written disclosures regarding Ernst & Young LLP's independence as required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence.  
The Committee discussed with our internal auditor and Ernst & Young LLP the overall scope and plan for their respective audits. The Committee met with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of our internal controls, and the overall quality of our financial reporting. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee also evaluated and reappointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
This Audit Committee report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under the Exchange Act.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  This is considered to be a routine matter and, therefore, if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting  instructions to the broker, trustee, or other nominee that holds your shares, the nominee has discretionary authority to vote on this Proposal but not any other Proposals since they are considered to be  "non-routine" matters.  
[END TABLE]
Abstentions as to any matter are counted in determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting. They are not included in the vote count for election of directors. However, abstentions will affect the outcome of the vote on Proposals 2 and 3, being equivalent to a vote "against" the Proposals. 
Will any other matters be voted on?    We are not aware of any other matters on which you will be asked to vote at the Annual Meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will use their discretion to vote on these matters as they may arise. Furthermore, if a nominee cannot or will not serve as director, then the proxy holders will vote for a replacement nominated by the Board. We do not expect any nominee to be unwilling to serve. 
May I ask questions at the Annual Meeting?    Yes. Our management will respond to shareholder questions at the end of the meeting. In order to give a greater number of shareholders the opportunity to ask questions, we may impose certain procedural requirements. 
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record, a beneficial owner, or a Nordson-sponsored retirement plan participant? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shareholder of record.    If Nordson shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent,  Computershare, Inc., you are considered the shareholder of record and these proxy materials have been sent directly to you. You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You may also award us your proxy to vote your shares by telephone, via the  Internet, or by mailing your signed proxy/voting instruction card in the postage-paid envelope provided. The card provides voting instructions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Beneficial owner ("in street name").    If your shares are not held in your name but  instead are held in a brokerage account, by a trustee, or by another nominee, then that other entity/holder is considered the shareholder of record and you are considered a beneficial owner of those shares. We sent these proxy materials to that  other entity/holder, and they have been forwarded to you with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee, or other nominee how to vote. Please refer to the information your broker, trustee,  or other nominee provided to determine what voting options are available to you.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares held as a participant in the Nordson Corporation Employees' Savings Trust ("401(k)") Plan and/or  Nordson Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (collectively, the "Plans").    If you participate in one or both of these Plans you may have certain voting rights regarding shares of our common stock credited to  your account in the Plans. You do not own these shares. They are owned by the Plan trustee, which is the same trustee for both Plans.  
[END TABLE]
The Plans provide you with voting rights based on the number of shares that were constructively invested in your Plan account as of the close of business on the record date. You may vote these shares in much the same way as shareholders of record vote their shares, but you have an earlier deadline to vote. 
You may vote the amount of shares credited to your account as of the record date for the Annual Meeting by telephone, via the Internet, or by mailing your signed proxy/voting instruction card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on February 21, 2019. You may vote these shares by following the instructions provided on the proxy/voting instruction card included with these materials. 
By submitting your voting instructions, you will direct the Plan trustee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How to vote the shares allocated to your account in the Plan(s), and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How to vote a portion of the shares allocated to the accounts of other participants in the Plan(s) who have not submitted  voting instructions by the deadline.  
[END TABLE]
The trustee will submit one proxy to vote all shares in each of the Plans. The trustee will vote the shares of participants submitting voting instructions in accordance with their instructions and will vote the remaining shares in each of the Plans in the same proportion as the final votes of all participants who actually voted. Please note that, if you do not submit voting instructions for the shares in your account by the voting deadline, those shares will be included with the other undirected shares and voted by the trustee as described above. Because the trustee submits one proxy to vote all shares in each of the Plans, you may not vote Plan shares in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Where is Nordson Corporation common stock traded?    Our common stock is traded and quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market LLC under the symbol "NDSN." 
How many votes do I have, and can I cumulate my votes?    You have one vote for each share of our common stock that you own. Unless cumulative voting is invoked by a shareholder through proper notice to Nordson as described under "Proposal 1: Election of Directors Whose Terms Expire in 2022-Cumulative Voting," cumulative voting is not allowed. 
How do I vote and what are the voting deadlines? 
Shareholders of record and Plan participants.    If you are a shareholder of record or a Plan participant, you may vote by proxy in any of the following three ways: 
1. By telephone.    If you reside in the United States or Canada, you may call 1-800-690-6903, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy/voting instruction card in hand when you call and follow the voice prompts to cast your vote. 
2. Via the Internet.    You may access the website at www.proxyvote.com to cast your vote 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With your proxy/voting instruction card in hand, follow the instructions provided to cast your vote. 
3. By mail.    You may mark, sign and date your proxy/voting instruction card and return it in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope. You do not need to mail the proxy/voting instruction card if you have voted by telephone or over the Internet. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  81 
[END TABLE]
The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate votes cast and allow shareholders to appoint a proxy and to confirm that their actions have been properly recorded. Specific voting instructions are set forth on the accompanying proxy/voting instruction card. 
If you are a shareholder of record, your deadline to cast your vote by proxy is 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 25, 2019. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a Plan participant, your deadline to cast your vote by proxy is 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 21, 2019.  
Beneficial owners.    If you are a beneficial owner, you should receive voting instructions from the broker, trustee, or other nominee holding your shares. You should follow the instructions in the notice or voting instructions provided by your broker, trustee, or nominee in order to instruct your broker, trustee, or other nominee on how to vote your shares. The availability of telephone and Internet voting will depend on the voting process of the broker, trustee, or nominee. Shares held beneficially may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, trustee or nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. 
All owners.    If you receive more than one proxy/voting instruction card, it is important that you vote all shares represented by the multiple cards. Each card represents different shares. 
May I change my vote?    Yes. You may change your vote or revoke your proxy any time before the voting deadline. 
Shareholders of record.    If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your vote at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a later-dated proxy by telephone or via the Internet since only your latest Internet or telephone proxy received  by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 25, 2019 will be counted;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• returning a later-dated, duly executed proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering a written revocation to our Corporate Secretary at 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio 44145 before the Annual  Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attending the Annual Meeting in person and voting again.  
[END TABLE]
Plan participants.    If you are a Plan participant, you may revoke previously given voting instructions on or before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 21, 2019 by filing either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed voting instruction card bearing a later date with John Hancock Trust Company, LLC, the trustee for each of the Plans. 
Beneficial Owners.    If you are a beneficial owner of your shares, you must contact the broker, trustee, or other nominee holding your shares and follow their instructions for changing your vote. 
All owners.    You will not revoke a proxy merely by attending the Annual Meeting. To revoke a proxy, you must take one of the actions described above. 
What will happen if I do not vote my shares? 
Shareholders of record.    If you are the shareholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone, via the Internet, or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
Beneficial owners.    If you are the beneficial owner of your shares, your broker, trustee, or nominee may vote your shares only on those proposals on which it has discretion to vote. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), your broker, trustee, or nominee does not have discretion to vote your shares on non-routine matters such as Proposals 1 and 3. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, trustee, or other nominee, your broker, trustee, or other nominee may only vote your shares on Proposal 2 and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
What if I do not specify how my shares are to be voted?    If you are a shareholder of record and you submit a duly executed proxy, but you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted as indicated in the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

What constitutes a quorum, and why is a quorum required?    Our Regulations require a quorum of shareholders to hold our Annual Meeting. A quorum will be present when at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are represented at the Annual Meeting either in person or by proxy. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum if you submit a proxy or vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) will also count towards the quorum requirement. If a quorum is not achieved, a majority of the shares present at the Annual Meeting may adjourn the meeting to a later date. 
What are broker non-votes?    A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, trustee, or other nominee holding your shares does not receive voting instructions from you as the beneficial owner of the shares by a specified date before the Annual Meeting and does not have discretionary authority to vote those undirected shares on specified matters under SEC rules. The election of directors (Proposal 1) and the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 3) are considered non-routine matters and discretionary voting on these matters is prohibited. 
As a result, if you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in street name, and do not give your broker, trustee, or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to the election of directors or the advisory vote on named executive compensation, no votes will be cast on your behalf with respect to those proposals. The ratification of auditors (Proposal 2) is a discretionary matter, so your broker, trustee, or other nominee will be permitted to exercise discretionary authority to vote your shares with respect to the ratification of our selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm even if you do not give your broker, trustee, or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to that proposal. 
Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes with respect to a particular proposal. Thus, a broker non-vote will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum and will not otherwise affect the outcome of the vote on a proposal that requires a plurality of votes cast (Proposal 1) or the approval of Proposal 2 since brokers have discretion to vote uninstructed shares on that proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on Proposals 2 or 3. It is important that you provide voting instructions for all shares you own beneficially. 
Who will tabulate the votes?    Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") has been engaged as our independent agent to receive and tabulate shareholder votes. Broadridge will separately tabulate FOR, AGAINST and WITHHOLD votes, abstentions, and broker non-votes. The Inspector of Election will certify the election results and perform any other acts required by Ohio Corporation Law. 
What happens if the Annual Meeting is adjourned or postponed?    Your proxy will still be effective and will be voted at the rescheduled Annual Meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted.

 Nordson Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement   |  83 
[END TABLE]
Who is paying for the costs of this proxy solicitation?    We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies. Proxies may also be solicited by Nordson personnel who will not receive additional compensation for such solicitation. Copies of proxy materials and the Annual Report to Shareholders will be supplied to brokers, trustees, and other nominees for the purpose of soliciting proxies from beneficial owners. 
How will I know the results of the Annual Meeting?    The final voting results will be tallied by our Inspector of Election and published in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC that we expect to file within four business days after the Annual Meeting. 
If there is more than one shareholder living at the same address, will each shareholder receive proxy materials?    To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate materials to shareholders sharing the same address, we have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, certain shareholders of record who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of the Annual Report to Shareholders and proxy materials until such time as one or more of these shareholders notifies us that they wish to receive individual copies by contacting us at the address and phone number below. Shareholders of record in the same household continue to receive separate proxy/voting instruction cards. In addition, if your household currently receives multiple copies of our Annual Report to Shareholders and proxy materials, you may "opt in" to householding for future mailings to receive a single copy of these documents. 
We will mail materials that you request at no cost. You may contact us with your request by writing to or calling Corporate Communications, Nordson Corporation, 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio, 44145 or 440-414-5606. You may also access the Proxy Statement and Annual Report at: www.nordson.com/en/our-company/investors/annual-reports-and-presentations. 
How do I submit director nominations or shareholder proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting? 
Shareholder Proposals Submitted Under Rule 14a-8 
Assuming that our 2020 Annual Meeting is held within thirty days of the anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting, any shareholder who wishes to submit a proposal for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting and for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), should send the proposal to c/o Secretary, Nordson Corporation, 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio 44145 for receipt on or before September 20, 2019. 
Proposals and Director Nominations Submitted Pursuant to our Regulations 
Additionally, under our Regulations, a shareholder may submit a proposal for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting, but not for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement, if the shareholder provides written notice no earlier than 90 days and no later than 60 days prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting. Assuming that the 2020 Annual Meeting will be held on February 25, 2020, that means notice of such proposals must be received no earlier than November 27, 2019 and no later than December 27, 2019. Our Regulations are available at: www.nordson.com/en/our-company/corporate-governance. 
Similar to the timeliness requirements under our Regulations described above, the notice of the nomination of a director must be received no earlier than 90 days and no later than 60 days prior to our annual meeting. Assuming the 2020 Annual Meeting is held on February 25, 2020, the deadlines would be no earlier than November 27, 2019 and no later than December 27, 2019. The Governance and Nominating Committee will assess the qualifications of the candidate according to criteria set out in Nordson Corporation's Governance Guidelines, which are available at: www.nordson.com/en/our-company/corporate-governance. For a candidate to be considered for election as a director or for business to be properly requested by a shareholder to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must comply with all of the requirements of our Regulations, not just the timeliness requirements described above. Any proposal for inclusion in the proxy materials, notice of proposal, or suggestion for nominee(s) for election to our Board of Directors should be sent to c/o Secretary, Nordson Corporation, 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio 44145. 
If the notices delivered pursuant to the Regulations are not timely received, then we will not be required to present such proposals or nominations, as applicable, at the 2020 Annual Meeting. If the Board chooses to present any information submitted after the deadlines set forth in the Regulations (other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act) at the 2020 Annual Meeting, then the persons named in proxies solicited by the Board for the 2020 Annual Meeting may exercise discretionary voting power with respect to such information. 
What is our policy governing communication with our Board of Directors? 
Members of our management team regularly meet with shareholders to discuss a broad range of topics, including our governance and compensation practices. In addition, our Board provides to every shareholder the ability to communicate with the Board as a whole and with individual directors through an established process for shareholder communication. 
Shareholders may communicate with the Board, the Chair of the Board, a Board committee, the non-employee directors as a group, or individual directors by sending written communications addressed to the Board of Directors, a Board committee or such individual director or directors, c/o Secretary, Nordson Corporation, 28601 Clemens Road, Westlake, Ohio 44145. 
Each communication should specify the applicable addressee or addressees to be contacted as well as the general topic of the communication. Our Secretary will initially review communications before forwarding them to members of the Board to whom the communication is directed, or if the communication is not directed to any specific member(s) of the Board, to the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee. We generally will not forward a shareholder communication that is primarily commercial in nature, relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or requests general information about the Company. Concerns about accounting or auditing matters or possible violations of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct should be reported pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Code.
