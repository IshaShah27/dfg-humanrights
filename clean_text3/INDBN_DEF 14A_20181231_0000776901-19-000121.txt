2019 PROXY STATEMENT
[BEGIN TABLE]
THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING PROCEDURES 
[END TABLE]
This proxy statement contains information about the 2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting of Independent Bank Corp. The meeting will be held on Thursday, May 16, 2019, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time at the DoubleTree by Hilton Boston, 929 Hingham Street, Rockland, Massachusetts. Independent Bank Corp. is, for ease of reference, referred to in this proxy statement as the "Company." Rockland Trust Company, our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, is for ease of reference, referred to in this proxy statement as "Rockland Trust."
What is the purpose of the annual meeting?
At the annual meeting, shareholders will vote upon the matters summarized in the formal meeting notice. This proxy statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote. Please read it carefully.
Who can vote?
Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 22, 2019 are entitled to vote. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote at the annual meeting. On March 22, 2019, there were 28,137,531 shares of our common stock outstanding and eligible to vote.
How do I vote?
If you are a registered shareholder (that is, if you hold shares directly registered in your own name) you have four voting options:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Over the internet at the internet address shown on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Internet Availability"); 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By telephone, by calling the telephone number on your proxy form; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By mail, by completing, signing, dating, and returning your proxy form; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By attending the annual meeting and voting your shares in person. 
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, or other nominee, which is known as being held in "street name," you will receive separate voting instructions from that bank, broker or other nominee. If you hold your shares in street name, your ability to vote by internet or by telephone depends on the voting process of the entity that holds your shares. Although most banks, brokers, and nominees also offer internet and telephone voting, availability and specific procedures will depend on their voting arrangements. Please follow their directions carefully. If you want to vote shares that you hold in street name at the meeting, you must request a legal proxy from the entity that holds your shares and present that proxy, along with proof of your identity, at the meeting.
If you are a registered holder or hold your shares in street name, votes submitted by internet or telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 15, 2019. For Company stock you own in the Rockland Trust 
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 2
Table of Contents
Company Employee Savings, Profit Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan, your proxy card or voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 14, 2019. All outstanding shares of common stock for which you have provided instructions that are received by the applicable deadline will be voted.
Even if you plan to attend the meeting, you are encouraged to vote by proxy prior to the meeting.
Can I revoke or change my vote?
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before voting begins at the annual meeting.
Any shareholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it is exercised by (i) filing a written notice of revocation with our Secretary at least one business day prior to the meeting, (ii) submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date which is received by our Secretary prior to the deadlines noted above, or (iii) appearing at the meeting in person and giving our Secretary proper written notice of his or her intention to vote in person.
If your shares are held in street name, you should contact your bank, broker, or other nominee to revoke your proxy or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from the entity which holds your shares giving you the right to vote your shares at the meeting, you may change your vote by attending the meeting and voting in person.
Who is asking for my vote?
The Independent Bank Corp. Board of Directors (the "Board") is requesting your vote. We filed a definitive proxy statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 28, 2019, a copy of which will be made available via the internet on April 3, 2019.
What are the Board's voting recommendations?
The Board recommends that you vote as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) "FOR" the reelection of each of Michael P. Hogan, Eileen C. Miskell, Gerard F. Nadeau, and Thomas R. Venables to serve as Class II Directors.  
(2) "FOR" the proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
(3) "FOR" approval of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Each proxy that the Board receives that is not timely revoked, in writing, will be voted in accordance with the instructions it contains. If you submit your proxy but do not specify how you want your shares to be voted, they will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations. The Board will only use proxies received prior to or at the annual meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting for which no new record date is set. If any other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons appointed as proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment.
How many votes are needed?
Assuming a quorum is present, the vote required for approval of the matters to be considered is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal 1: A majority of votes cast by shareholders present, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting is required for the election of directors in uncontested elections. 
Proposal 2: A majority of votes cast by shareholders present, in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of our independent registered accounting firm. 
Proposal 3: A majority of votes cast by shareholders present, in person or by proxy, is required to approve the advisory proposal on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 3
Table of Contents
Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and accordingly are disregarded for purposes of determining whether a proposal has been approved. Approval by a "majority of votes cast" means that the number of votes cast "FOR" must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST".
Banks, brokers, or other nominees may vote shares held for a customer in street name on matters that are considered to be "routine" even if they have not received instructions from their customer. If a matter is not considered "routine" then the bank, broker, or other nominee may not vote shares with respect to that non-routine matter if they have not received instructions from their customer. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker, or other nominee has not received voting instructions from a customer and cannot vote the customer's shares because the matter is not considered routine.
The only proposal before the meeting this year deemed a "routine" matter is ratifying the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. This means that if your shares are held in street name, your bank, broker, or other nominee can vote your shares on that proposal even if you do not provide timely voting instructions. All other proposals are not considered "routine" matters. As a result, if you do not instruct your bank, broker, or nominee how to vote on the other proposals, no vote will be cast and a broker "non-vote" will occur.
Who can attend the meeting?
Shareholders of record and beneficial owners as of March 22, 2019 may attend the meeting, accompanied by one guest. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting we encourage you to vote your shares in advance by proxy. If you choose to attend, please bring proof of stock ownership and a valid form of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, with you.
How many shareholders need to attend the meeting?
In order to conduct the meeting, a majority of shares entitled to vote as of the record date, or at least 14,068,766 shares, must be present in person or by proxy. This is called a quorum. If you return valid proxy instructions or vote in person at the meeting, you will be considered part of the quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as being present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Where can I find the voting results from the meeting?
The voting results will be reported in a Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC within four business days of the meeting.
Householding of annual meeting materials
Some banks, brokers, and other nominee record holders participate in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports. If a household participates in the householding program, it will receive one envelope containing the Notices of Internet Availability for all shareholders in the household (or, as the case may be, one set of proxy materials and a separate proxy card for each shareholder account in the household). If applicable, please vote all proxy cards enclosed in such a package. We will promptly deliver the Notice of Internet Availability separately, or deliver multiple copies of the proxy statement materials, to you if you contact us at the following address or telephone number: Edward H. Seksay, General Counsel and Secretary, Independent Bank Corp., 288 Union Street, Rockland, Massachusetts 02370; telephone: (781) 982-6158. If you hold your shares in street name and want to receive the Notice of Internet Availability separately or receive separate copies of the proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy per household, you should contact your bank, broker, or other nominee record holder. 
Participation in householding will not affect or apply to any of your other shareholder mailings. Householding saves us money by reducing printing and postage costs and is environmentally friendly. It also creates less paper for shareholders to manage. If you are a beneficial holder, you can request information about householding from your broker, bank or other nominee.

[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED UPON AT ANNUAL MEETING 
[END TABLE]
Election of Directors (Proposal 1):
Our Board of Directors currently has 12 members. The Company's articles of organization provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, and that the members of each class are to be elected for a term of three years.
Directors continue to serve until their three-year term expires and until their successors are elected and qualified, unless they earlier reach the mandatory retirement age of 72, die, resign, or are removed from office. One class of directors is elected annually.
The Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, which we sometimes refer to in this proxy statement as the "nominating committee", selects director nominees to be presented for shareholder approval at the annual meeting, including the nomination of incumbent directors for reelection and the consideration of any director nominations submitted by shareholders. For information relating to the nomination, or recommendation for nomination, of directors by our shareholders, see "Board of Directors Information - Shareholder Director Nominations and Recommendations" below.
All director candidates are evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Company's Governance Principles, which may be viewed by accessing the Investor Relations link under the About Us category on the Rockland Trust website: http://www.rocklandtrust.com, with respect to director qualifications. (We have included references to the Rockland Trust website address at different points in this proxy statement as an inactive textual reference and do not intend it to be an active link to our website. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.) In evaluating the qualifications of potential new directors, the Board considers a set of recruitment criteria intended to, based upon the characteristics of the then current Board, take Board diversity into account with respect to personal attributes and characteristics, professional experience, skills, and other qualifications. For incumbent directors, the Board and the nominating committee also consider the director's response to a self-assessment questionnaire and the director's attendance and participation in, and overall contribution to, the work of the Board. Directors must be willing to devote sufficient time to carry out their duties and responsibilities and should be committed to serving on the Board for an extended period of time. 
The Company's By-Laws and Governance Principles provide for majority voting in uncontested director elections. In an uncontested election, if an incumbent director standing for election is not reelected by a majority of the votes cast, the director is required to promptly tender a notice of resignation to the Board. The resignation is not effective unless accepted by the Board. The nominating committee would then recommend whether the Board should accept or reject a tendered resignation. In determining whether to accept a tendered resignation, the Board would consider the potential impact of the resignation on compliance with applicable legal and listing standards and any other factors deemed relevant. The decision of the Board would be promptly disclosed in a Form 8-K. In contested director elections, the vote standard would be a plurality of votes cast.
All nominees currently serve on our Board. The Board and the nominating committee, with the directors up for reelection abstaining, have nominated Michael P. Hogan, Eileen C. Miskell, Gerard F. Nadeau and Thomas R. Venables, whom we refer to in this proxy statement as the "board nominees," for reelection at the annual meeting to the class of directors whose terms will expire at the 2022 annual meeting. In nominating each of the board nominees for reelection, the nominating committee determined that the board nominees possess the specific experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills described below under "Board of Directors Information" to serve as a director of the Company and Rockland Trust. There are no agreements or arrangements between any director or director nominee and any third party other than the Company relating to compensation or other payments in connection with any director or director nominee's candidacy or service as a director.   
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 5
Table of Contents
Unless instructions to the contrary are received, it is intended that the shares represented by proxies will be voted for the reelection of the board nominees. Each of the board nominees has consented to serve, and we have no reason to believe that any of the board nominees will be unable to serve if elected. If, however, any of the board nominees should not be available for election at the time of the annual meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote the shares to which the proxy relates, unless authority to do so has been withheld or limited in the proxy, for the election of such other person or persons as may be designated by the Board or, in the absence of such designation, in such other manner as they may, in their discretion, determine.
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the reelection of each of the board nominees. Proxies solicited by  the Board will be so voted in the absence of direction to the contrary.

[END TABLE]
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Proposal 2):
The audit committee has appointed the firm Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. While we are not required to have shareholders ratify the selection of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board considers the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter and is therefore submitting the selection of EY for ratification by shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice.
EY has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2009. The audit committee is involved in selecting the lead EY partner for the Company, and the current lead EY partner was selected in 2017. The audit committee considers the impact of changing auditors when assessing whether to retain the current external auditor.
The following table shows the fees paid or accrued by us for professional services provided by EY during 2018 and 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018 2017 
Audit Fees $ 1,192,605   $ 1,097,949   
Audit-Related Fees(1) 195,700   91,000   
Tax Fees —   —   
All Other Fees(2) 6,990   1,995   
Total Fees $ 1,395,295   $ 1,190,944   
[END TABLE]
(1) Audit-related fees are associated with the employee benefit plan and other subsidiary stand-alone audits.
(2) Other fees are associated with a subscription to an online research tool.
The audit committee has considered the nature of the other services provided by EY and determined that they are compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The audit committee has discussed the other services with EY and management to determine that such services are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favor of ratifying EY as our independent registered public accounting firm and believes that the choice of EY as the Company's independent auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If shareholders do not ratify the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm, the audit committee will reconsider the appointment of EY at the appropriate time. We anticipate, however, that there would be no immediate change in our independent registered public accounting firm this year if shareholders do not ratify the selection of EY because of the practical difficulty and expense associated with making such a change mid-year. Even if shareholders ratify the selection of EY, the audit committee may, in its discretion, change our independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that it would be in the best interests of the Company to do so.
An EY representative is expected to be present at the annual meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Proposal 3):
The Company is providing shareholders with an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (sometimes referred to as our "say on pay" vote) as disclosed in this proxy statement. In accordance with the preference expressed by our shareholders at our 2017 annual meeting, we currently hold an annual say on pay vote. Accordingly, you may vote on the following resolution at the 2019 annual meeting:

Board Leadership Structure and Executive Sessions
The Board has named as its Chair an independent director who is not also the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or of Rockland Trust and believes that such a leadership structure is appropriate to segregate the Board's oversight role from management of the Company and Rockland Trust. The Board provides oversight of the Chief Executive Officer and other management of the Company and Rockland Trust to ensure that the long-term interests of shareholders are being served through 12 regularly scheduled meetings and one all-day strategic planning meeting with management each year, and additional meetings when necessary or advisable. At these meetings, reports on the management and performance of the Company and Rockland Trust, including reports regarding liquidity, interest rate risk, credit quality, loan loss provision, regulatory compliance, and other risks, are reviewed. During each regularly-scheduled Board meeting there is an opportunity for our independent non-employee directors to meet in executive session, without the Chief Executive Officer or any other member of management present. The Board also regularly meets with the Chief Executive Officer alone so as to have the ability to discuss topics without other members of management present.  
The Board has also established the Board committees described below which regularly meet and report back to the Board on the responsibilities delegated to them. Each Board committee has the authority to engage outside experts, advisors, and counsel if needed to assist the committee in its work. During each meeting committees have the opportunity to hold executive sessions without the Chief Executive Officer or any other member of management present.
In addition to its general oversight role, the Board also: selects, evaluates, and compensates the Chief Executive Officer and oversees Chief Executive Officer succession planning; reviews, monitors, and, when necessary or appropriate, approves fundamental financial and business strategies and major corporate actions; assesses major risks facing the Company or Rockland Trust and options for their mitigation; and seeks to maintain the integrity of financial statements and the integrity of compliance with law and ethics of the Company and Rockland Trust.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors should, as a result of their occupation, background, and/or experience, possess a mature business judgment that enables them to make a positive contribution to the Board.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• While familiarity with the communities that Rockland Trust serves is one factor to be considered in determining if an individual is qualified to serve as a Director, it is not a controlling factor.

Report of the Audit Committee1 
Each member of the audit committee is "independent" as defined under Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, and SEC rules and regulations, and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, the Board has determined that Eileen C. Miskell, CPA, Chair of the audit committee, and Daniel F. O'Brien, CPA each qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in regulations issued pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
The audit committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board. The audit committee charter sets forth the audit services, audit-related services, and tax services which the audit committee has pre-approved our independent registered public accounting firm to perform up to a maximum fee of $25,000 and the authority which the Board has granted to the audit committee chair to pre-approve the performance of any services by our independent registered public accounting firm in the interval between audit committee meetings. The current audit committee charter may be viewed by accessing the Investor Relations link under the About Us category on the Rockland Trust website (http://www.rocklandtrust.com) under Governance Documents.
The audit committee is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of our audit process and for monitoring our accounting, financial reporting, data processing, regulatory, and internal control functions. One of the audit committee's primary responsibilities is to enhance the independence of the audit function, thereby furthering the objectivity of financial reporting. Accordingly, the audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, who must report directly to the audit committee.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Directors Abelli, Jones, Miskell, and O'Brien served as members of the compensation committees of the Company and Rockland Trust during the last fiscal year. No current or former executive officer or other employee of the Company or Rockland Trust served on the compensation committees of either the Company or Rockland Trust. No director or executive officer of the Company or Rockland Trust served on the compensation committee or the board of directors of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served on the compensation committee or the Board of the Company or Rockland Trust. No member of the compensation committee of the Company or Rockland Trust had any relationship with the Company or Rockland Trust since January 1, 2018 requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.
Related Party Transactions
Since January 1, 2018, neither the Company nor Rockland Trust has been a party to any transaction or series of transactions in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and which any director, executive officer, or holder of more than 5% of our stock, or any member of the immediate family of any such person, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest other than standard compensation arrangements described below under "Executive Officer Information," and above under "Director Cash and Equity Compensation," and the ordinary course transactions described below.
Pursuant to various regulatory requirements and other applicable law, the Board of Rockland Trust must approve certain extensions of credit, contracts, and other transactions between Rockland Trust and any director or executive officer. The Board has adopted a written policy, and Rockland Trust has established written procedures, to implement these requirements which state, in essence, that any transaction between Rockland Trust and any director or executive officer, or any of their immediate family members must be made on terms comparable to those which Rockland Trust would reach with an unrelated, similarly situated third-party and must be approved in advance by a Board vote. Rockland Trust's General Counsel and Rockland Trust's designated Federal Reserve Bank Regulation O officer share responsibility for oversight and implementation of the Board policy and Rockland Trust procedures for review of related party transactions, which are typically applied to extensions of credit and any other financial transaction of a material nature between Rockland Trust and any director or executive officer. Any director or executive officer involved in such a transaction leaves the meetings while the Board considers and votes upon the transaction.
Some of the directors and executive officers of the Company, as well as members of their immediate families and the companies, organizations, trusts, and other entities with which they are associated are, or during 2018 were, also customers of Rockland Trust in the ordinary course of business, or had loans outstanding during 2018. It is anticipated that they and their associates will continue to be customers of and be indebted to Rockland Trust in the future. All customer relationships with and loans to directors, executive officers, and their associates were in the ordinary course of business. All loans to directors, executive officers, or their associates did not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with unaffiliated persons and, where required by law, were prior approved by the Rockland Trust Board. No loans to directors, executive officers, or their associates are nonperforming.
Director Independence
Nasdaq rules, and our Governance Principles, require that at least a majority of our Board be composed of "independent" directors. The following two directors are the only directors not currently considered "independent": Mr. Oddleifson, who is the President and CEO of the Company and the CEO of Rockland Trust, and Mr. Nadeau, who is the President of Rockland Trust.
All other current directors of the Company and of Rockland Trust are "independent" within the meaning of both the Nasdaq rules and our own Governance Principles. Accordingly, ten of the twelve directors who currently serve on the Board are "independent" directors. In making its director independence determinations the Board considered any transactions, relationships, or arrangements disclosed by directors and/or noted in the records which Rockland Trust maintains in the ordinary course of business, including the customer relationships and indebtedness described above,

Other than the employment agreements with Mr. Oddleifson, Mr. Nadeau, Mr. Cozzone, Ms. Harris, Mr. Jensen, and Mr. Seksay, there are no arrangements or understandings between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which such person was appointed as an executive officer.
Relationship Between Compensation Policies And Risk
Rockland Trust sometimes uses variable cash incentive compensation programs and/or plans, and performance-based restricted stock awards, to reward and incent employee performance and retain top talent. A detailed financial analysis of any potential cash incentive compensation program or plan, or performance-based restricted stock award, is performed prior to approval. Our cash incentive programs and plans and performance-based restricted stock awards typically establish maximum award caps. Cash incentive programs and plans typically evaluate whether risk management and compliance results are satisfactory in determining whether to make an award, and reserve the ability to lower any cash award otherwise payable to zero in the sole discretion of management (and in the sole discretion of the Board, in the event of programs or plans applicable to executive officers). Any cash incentive compensation program or plan of a material nature, or performance-based restricted stock award, is approved by or reported to the compensation committee and the Board. The Company does not believe that the incentive compensation or other policies and practices of the Company and of Rockland Trust are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis contains a description of our executive compensation philosophy and programs, the compensation decisions made under those programs, and the considerations in making those decisions for our named executive officers.  The Compensation Discussion and Analysis also describes the process of the Compensation Committee in determining our compensation programs. 
Executive Compensation Summary
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate executive officers to achieve our operating goals and strategic objectives. We use a pay-for-performance approach that is intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, with the ultimate goal of improving long-term shareholder value.  The executive compensation program of Rockland Trust typically has four primary elements: base salary, annual cash incentive compensation, long-term equity-based compensation, and benefits.  The following table provides detail on base salary, annual cash incentive compensation, and long-term equity compensation:

Base salaries are intended to be competitive relative to similar positions at peer institutions in order to provide Rockland Trust with the ability to attract and retain executives with a broad, proven track record of performance.
The use of variable annual cash incentive compensation or discretionary cash bonuses is designed to provide a competitive cash payment opportunity based both on individual performance and the Company's overall financial performance. The opportunity for a more significant award increases when both the Company and the employee achieve higher levels of performance. The Company grants cash incentive compensation pursuant to a non-equity incentive plan or on certain limited occasions, by granting discretionary cash bonuses.
Equity awards are granted under our long-term equity-based compensation incentive plan to selected groups of individuals, including our executive officers, in the form of restricted stock, performance based restricted stock, and/or stock options. Equity awards are intended to link executive officer financial outcomes to performance that maximizes long-term shareholder returns and are designed to encourage officer retention. Stock Options have not been awarded to Named Executive Officers since 2011. 
In addition to the three components detailed above, the Company also offers a variety of benefits to remain competitive in the market. Management feels these benefits attract a high caliber management team and ensure stability and continuity in leadership. Rockland Trust provides to its Chief Executive Officer and certain named executive officers certain benefits, such as retirement programs, medical plans, life and disability insurance, use of company owned automobiles, and employment agreements. The compensation committee periodically reviews executive officer benefits to ensure that they are competitive with market practice. 
The compensation committee strives to balance short-term and long-term Company performance and shareholder returns in establishing performance criteria. Performance criteria reflect fiscal year budgets; strategic objectives; competitive peer performance; and economic, regulatory, industry and other relevant factors. The compensation committee evaluates executive compensation against performance criteria and competitive executive pay practices before determining changes in base salary, the amount of any incentive payments, discretionary bonuses, equity awards and other benefits.

Compensation Committee - Composition and Responsibility
The Board has determined that all members of the compensation committee are independent directors in accordance with Nasdaq rules. There are currently four directors who serve on the compensation committee: Director O'Brien as Chair, and Directors Abelli, Jones, and Miskell. 
The compensation committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. The current compensation committee charter may be viewed by accessing the Investor Relations link under the About Us category on the Rockland Trust website (http://www.rocklandtrust.com) under Governance Documents. The compensation committee has, as stated in its charter, three primary responsibilities: (i) assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in determining the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and executive officers of the Company and Rockland Trust; (ii) establishing compensation policies that will attract and retain qualified personnel through an overall level of compensation that is comparable to, and competitive with, others in the industry and in particular, peer financial institutions; and (iii) assisting the Board with the design and development, for Board approval, of equity compensation plans.
The compensation committee, subject to the provisions of our 2005 Employee Plan, also has authority in its discretion to determine the employees of the Company and Rockland Trust to whom restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards, and/or stock options shall be granted, the number of shares to be granted to each employee, and the time or times at which restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards, and/or stock options should be granted. The CEO makes recommendations to the compensation committee about equity awards to the employees of the Company and Rockland Trust (other than the CEO). As equity compensation awards sometimes need to be made, on a timely basis, to retain or recruit key performers, the compensation committee has delegated authority to the CEO to award up to 10,000 shares of Company stock, in the aggregate, through restricted stock awards and/or stock option grants when, in the CEO's discretion, the making of an equity compensation award is necessary or advisable in connection with the recruitment of a new employee or the retention of any existing employee, excluding executive officers. The CEO is expressly required to promptly report the making of any equity compensation awards pursuant to the limited authority delegated to him at the first to occur of the next meeting of either the Board or the compensation committee. The compensation committee also has authority to interpret our 2005 Employee Plan and to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to it.
The CEO reviews the performance of the executive officers of the Company and Rockland Trust (other than the CEO) and, based on that review, the CEO makes recommendations to the compensation committee about the compensation of executive officers (other than the CEO). The CEO does not participate in any deliberations or approvals by the compensation committee or the Board with respect to his own compensation. The compensation committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• grants awards under the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard to executive officers and the CEO; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• determines whether performance objectives have been attained by the executive officers and CEO under previously granted performance-based restricted stock awards; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• makes recommendations to the Board for approval with respect to base salary and equity compensation of the CEO and the other executive officers of the Company and Rockland Trust.  
[END TABLE]
The compensation committee and the Board use summaries of proposed overall short and long-term compensation, summaries of compensation decisions made in past years, and competitive survey data showing current and historic elements of compensation, and other relevant information when reviewing executive officer and CEO compensation.
The compensation committee has directly engaged and been assisted and advised in its work by the following external executive compensation consultants:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mercer (US) Inc. reviewed the competitiveness of the base salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, and long term equity compensation for Rockland Trust's executive leadership team, a group which includes the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and all other executive officers, comparing the Company's executive compensation to Mercer's published survey data, other information, and to the peer groups identified in the Company's proxy statement this year and last year.

• The Hay Group analyzed salary ranges using the Hay proprietary method, provided market-based information about annual merit increases, and provided recommendations for equity compensation and other compensation matters.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sentinel Benefits provided actuarial and retirement plan design advisory services. Sentinel Benefits has also been engaged directly by management to provide actuarial services to assist with benefit plan accruals and related matters. 
[END TABLE]
No compensation consultant engaged by the compensation committee received more than $120,000 during 2018 for any additional services rendered to the Company or its affiliates. The compensation committee determined that none of the work performed by any compensation consultant engaged by the compensation committee in 2018 raised any conflict of interest.
The compensation committee has also reviewed publicly available materials and information derived from the following sources to assist in its work:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equilar, which provides an online database gathered from proxy statements and annual reports in the financial services industry. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• McLagan and Willis Towers Watson, which provide survey data to Rockland Trust for general comparative purposes. 
[END TABLE]
From time to time, the compensation committee may delegate authority to fulfill various functions of administering the Company's retirement plans to our employees. Currently, it delegates administration of retirement plans to the Retirement Committee, a group comprised of our Director of Human Resources, our CFO, our General Counsel, and the Vice President of Compensation and Benefits in Rockland Trust's Human Resources Department, each of whom has been determined to have the appropriate expertise, experience, and background to oversee the administration of our retirement plans. While retirement plan administration has been delegated, the Board and the compensation committee continue to determine the nature and amount of executive officer retirement benefits. 
Compensation Philosophy
The compensation philosophy of the Company and Rockland Trust rests on two primary principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of total compensation should vary with our performance in achieving financial and non-financial objectives; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation should be closely aligned with the interests of shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
The Company uses a "pay for performance" approach that offers a competitive total rewards package to help create long-term value for our shareholders. Accordingly, annual cash incentive compensation awards to our named executive officers are performance-based and approximately fifty-seven percent (57%) of the equity awards made to our named executive officers are performance-based restricted stock awards. In designing compensation programs, and making individual recommendations or decisions, the compensation committee focuses on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligning the interests of executive officers and shareholders; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attracting, retaining, and motivating high-performing employees in a cost-efficient manner; and 
[END TABLE]

The Company's compensation program reflects a mix of fixed and at risk compensation, designed to fairly reward executive officers and align their interests with those of shareholders in an efficient manner. Each element of the Company's compensation program is intended to provide employees with a pay opportunity that is externally competitive and which recognizes individual contributions. The following pie charts depict the pay mix for our named executive officers, as reflected in the Summary Compensation table:
"Say on Pay" Results
The Company has considered the result of the most recent shareholder "say on pay" advisory vote and the support of our compensation practices it reflects. Of the shares voting on last year's say on pay proposal, 96.76% voted in favor and 3.24% voted against. The Company therefore intends to continue to focus on "pay for performance" in its approach to executive officer compensation and to retain or adjust, as appropriate, the basic elements of the Company's compensation program in order to support that approach as described in this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."  
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 29
Table of Contents
Use of Peer Groups and Survey Information 
The Company periodically reviews executive officer total compensation against a peer group, using the comparison only as a competitive reference point and not as the sole determinative factor when making executive compensation decisions. The compensation committee periodically assesses the relevancy of the companies within the peer group and makes changes when appropriate.  
In January 2018 the compensation committee defined the Company's peer group based upon advice and assistance received from outside compensation consultant Mercer. Based on Mercer's recommendations, peers were selected from public and actively traded banks who satisfied the following criteria: (1) Geographic Criteria: banks headquartered in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont; (2) Total Asset Size Criteria: banks with total assets equal to one-half to two times the size of the Company's total assets, measuring by combining assets with, if applicable, third-party investment assets under administration; and, (3) Market Capitalization Criteria: banks with a market capitalization equal to one-half to two times the Company's market capitalization.  In August 2018 the compensation committee used the following peer group:
[BEGIN TABLE]
l Beneficial Bancorp Inc. l Meridian Bancorp, Inc. 
l Berkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. l NBT Bancorp Inc. 
l Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc. l Northwest Bancshares, Inc. 
l Brookline Bancorp Inc. l Provident Financial Services Inc.

l First Commonwealth Financial Corp. l Valley National Bancorp l Fulton Financial Corp. l Washington Trust Bancorp Inc. 
l Lakeland Bancorp Inc. l WSFS Financial Corp. 
[END TABLE]
In addition to reviewing information from the peer group, the compensation committee evaluates executive compensation by reviewing national and regional surveys that cover a broader group of companies.

Compensation Program Elements
Base Salary
Our compensation committee reviews our executives' base salaries annually in the first quarter and determines any recommendations for increases based primarily on performance evaluations, the individual's role and responsibilities, competitive survey data and any recommendations of its independent compensation consultant.
Rockland Trust uses the Hay Group proprietary job evaluation methodology in establishing competitive salary ranges and midpoints for the executives and officers of Rockland Trust. The Hay Group conducts market analyses of cash compensation within the banking industry and uses its proprietary job evaluation process to recommend salary midpoints and ranges that reflect competitive factors and maintain internal equity. The Hay Group makes annual recommendations to the compensation committee regarding market-based changes to salary ranges and merit increase programs, and adjustments to executive salary ranges were made based on the Hay Group's recommendations. 
In 2018, based upon the advice of outside compensation consultant Mercer and the recommendation of the compensation committee, the Board increased the base salary of our Chief Financial Officer Robert D. Cozzone to $400,000 effective January 1, 2018 (an approximate 13% increase) to reflect his assumption of additional Rockland Trust management responsibilities for our Consumer and Business Banking.  All other base salary increases for our named executive officers (with such increases ranging from approximately 3% to 6%) were made in accordance with the recommendations that the compensation committee received from Mercer and were generally consistent with the competitive survey data. These salary increases were effective April 1, 2018. 
The salary paid in 2018 to each of our named executive officers is set forth below in column (c) of the Summary Compensation Table.  
In early 2019, performance evaluations of Mr. Oddleifson and the other executive officers were completed with respect to their 2018 performance. In early 2019, the Board approved base salary increases for all executive officers based upon the recommendations of the compensation committee which were derived from: in the case of the executive officers other than Mr. Oddleifson, the evaluation of their performance by Mr. Oddleifson; and, in the case of Mr. Oddleifson, the Board's performance evaluation of Mr. Oddleifson. 
Annual Cash Incentive Compensation
Our annual cash incentive program for executives is administered under our Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard.  On February 13, 2019 the compensation committee approved incentive cash payments to the CEO and the other executive officers pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard for 2018 performance in the amounts set forth below in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table. 
The compensation committee determined the amount of cash incentive awards by applying the performance criteria set forth in the scorecard which it had approved for use in 2018. The scorecard established a "Target Award" for each named executive officer based upon a percentage of his base salary as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive Officer Target Percentage 
Christopher Oddleifson Sixty Percent (60%) 
Robert D. Cozzone Forty Percent (40%) 
Barry H. Jensen Thirty Percent (30%) 
Gerard F. Nadeau Forty Percent (40%) 
Edward H. Seksay Thirty Percent (30%) 
[END TABLE]
Applying the scorecard, the compensation committee determined the attainment of performance criteria and amount of cash incentive awards for the named executive officers as follows: 
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 31
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The award for the CEO was determined by the CEO's Target Award multiplied by the combined Company and Peer Performance Adjustment Factors; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards for the other named executive officers were determined by their Target Award multiplied by the combined Company and Peer Performance Adjustment Factors and by their Individual Performance Adjustment Factor, within a range from zero to 1.40, based upon an evaluation of individual performance with respect to attainment of major business objectives and other contributions. 
[END TABLE]
The scorecard calculated the combined Company and Peer Performance Adjustment Factors by combining them and dividing by two to give each factor equal weighting.
The Company Performance Adjustment Factor is based upon the Company's 2018 Operating Earnings per Share results within ranges set forth in the scorecard which specified threshold, target, and maximum performance levels, as shown in the chart below. Operating Earnings per Share is a non-GAAP measure. The scorecard defines Operating Earnings per Share as Net Income as reflected in the Company's audited consolidated statement of income on a per share basis, adjusted upwards or downwards as determined by the compensation committee for the after-tax effect of material non-recurring items. The "Operating Earnings per Share" metric used in the scorecard is the same as the "Net Operating Earnings per Diluted Share" metric set forth in the Company annual report on Form 10-K for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Please refer to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Net Operating Earnings to Net Income. The 2018 Target Operating Earnings per Share was $4.30.  As disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, the actual Operating Earnings per Diluted Share was $4.69.
The range of the Company Performance Adjustment Factor set forth in the scorecard was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Threshold Target Maximum 
CEO Range for Company Performance Adjustment Factor Fifty Percent (50%) of Target One Hundred Percent (100%) One Hundred Fifty Percent (150%) of Target 
Range of Company Performance Adjustment Factor for other Named Executive Officers Fifty Percent (50%) of Target One Hundred Percent (100%) One Hundred Twenty Five Percent (125%) of Target 
[END TABLE]
The scorecard determined the Peer Performance Adjustment Factor by the Company's performance compared to peer banks as measured by the publicly available Bank Holding Company Performance Report prepared by the Federal Reserve Board or by any other information deemed appropriate. The Company's performance with respect to Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Charge-Offs, and Non-Performing Assets was compared with the aggregate performance of peer banks for those measures. The Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard calculated the Peer Performance Adjustment Factor by averaging the Company's performance compared to peer banks within the following ranges:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Company's Percentile Performance To Peer Adjustment for Return On Assets Peer Comparison Adjustment for Return on Equity Peer Comparison Adjustment for Charge-Off Peer Comparison Adjustment for Non-Performing Asset Peer Comparison 
76-100 25% 25% -100% -100% 
56-75 12.5% 12.5% -12.5% -12.5% 
46-55 0% 0% 0% 0% 
26-45 -12.5% -12.5% 12.5% 12.5% 
0-25 -100% -100% 25% 25% 
[END TABLE]
Based on the results of the scorecard, the compensation committee accepted the recommendation of management to establish the combined Company and Peer Adjustment Factor at 118.75%. The Individual Performance factor was adjusted as defined in the plan parameters, up to a maximum of 1.40.

Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy
The Company has adopted an Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy which provides that, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Company will have the right, to the extent permitted by law, to recover any cash incentive compensation or performance-based equity awards paid during the three-year period preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement to any executive officer whose intentional misconduct caused the accounting restatement. The Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy does not apply to an accounting restatement arising from a change in accounting principles.
The policy directs the compensation committee to review incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the prior three years on the basis of having met or exceeded performance targets which are reduced by the accounting restatement and then to make a recommendation to the Board for approval with respect to the recovery of incentive compensation. The policy provides that the amount of incentive compensation recovery shall be no more than the difference between the amount paid and the amount that would have been paid based upon the accounting restatement. The policy states that the compensation committee and the Board will exercise their business judgment and discretion in the fair application of the Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy and consider all relevant factors in determining whether the Company will seek to recover incentive compensation from executive officers and the amount, timing, and form of any incentive compensation recovery.     
Long-Term Equity Compensation
Equity compensation and stock ownership serve to link the net worth of executive officers to the performance of our common stock and therefore provide an incentive to accomplish the strategic, long-term objectives established by the Company to maximize long-term shareholder returns. Long-term equity compensation grants are also designed to be a retention tool to the individuals to whom they are awarded and are made based on competitive factors, such as equity compensation awarded by peers and amounts that are determined to be appropriate in order to retain key personnel.
Performance-Based and Time Vested Restricted Stock Awards
In February 2018, the Board granted executive officers under the Employee Stock Plan both performance-based restricted stock awards with a three year performance period and time-based restricted stock awards that vest in equal increments over five years. The Board determined the aggregate number of shares granted to executive officers in 2018 through performance-based and time-based equity awards based upon a percentage of their base salary divided by a per share value computed using a trailing thirty day volume weighted average stock price, exercising discretion to round awarded shares to a whole number. The percentages of base salary used to determine 2018 long-term incentive grants were as follows: seventy-seven percent (77%) of base salary for the CEO; fifty-five percent (55%) of base salary for the CFO; and between thirty-seven and fifty-five percent (37-55%) of base salary for all other executive officers. Performance-based restricted stock awards comprised, in the aggregate, approximately fifty-seven percent (57%) and time vested restricted stock awards approximately forty-three percent (43%) of the 2018 equity awards made to executive officers, reflecting the Company's continued emphasis on awarding performance-based equity compensation. 
The February 2018 performance-based restricted stock awards are subject to vesting based on achievement of specified levels of return on average tangible common equity ("ROATE"), measured over the three-year performance period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 as compared against our peer group, described above under "Use of Peer Groups and Survey Information", subject to adjustment. If the Company's ROATE during the performance period is (i) less than the 25th percentile of the peer group, no restricted shares shall vest, (ii) equal to the 25th percentile of the peer group ("Threshold Performance"), then 25% of the restricted shares shall vest, (iii) equal to the 50th percentile of the peer group ("Median Performance"), then 50% of the restricted shares shall vest or (iv) equal to or greater than the 75th percentile of the peer group ("Maximum Performance"), then 100% of the restricted shares shall vest. If ROATE is between the Threshold Performance and Median Performance or between Median Performance and Maximum Performance, then the amount of restricted shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation on a straight line basis rounded to the nearest whole share. The initial allocation between performance share and time based equity awards for the CEO and other executive officers is determined based on Median Performance, with the performance share allotment then doubled for the performance share award to provide for the 
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 33
Table of Contents possibility of achieving Maximum Performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no performance-based restricted shares will vest if the Company's tangible book value measured as of the end of the performance period does not exceed tangible book value measured as of the first day of the performance period.
See the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below for additional information regarding the performance-based restricted stock awards and time vested restricted stock awards granted to our named executive officers in 2018.
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Company has established stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers. Executive officers are required to own common stock with a value equal to a designated multiple of their base salary, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position Stock Ownership Requirement 
Chief Executive Officer of the Company 3x annual base salary 
President of Rockland Trust 2x annual base salary 
Chief Financial Officer 2x annual base salary 
Executive Vice President 2x annual base salary 
All Other Executive Officers 1x annual base salary 
[END TABLE]
Individuals have until the end of the calendar year following the fifth anniversary of their date of hiring or promotion to an executive officer position to satisfy these guidelines. The following are counted towards an individual's ownership: shares directly held by the individual and those held jointly with another person, stock held in a retirement or deferred compensation account, unvested time-based restricted shares and stock held in a trust of which the individual is both trustee and beneficiary. Stock options and performance-based restricted stock awards are not counted towards the ownership requirements. Each of our executive officers satisfies our stock ownership guidelines. Information about the stock ownership of named executive officers as of December 31, 2018 is provided in the table below entitled "Stock Ownership and Other Matters."
Retirement Benefits
Nonqualified Retirement Plans for Executive Officers 
The Company has for many years maintained a nonqualified retirement program for executive officers. 
In 2001, the Board approved a nonqualified defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan (the "Rockland SERP") to help accomplish the objectives of its nonqualified executive officer retirement program, with the assets used to fund the actuarial accrued liability of the Rockland SERP held in a Rabbi Trust. Benefits for the original executive officer participants were originally calculated in 2001 when the Rockland SERP was established. Benefits for additional individual executive officers were calculated as they were added as participants to the Rockland SERP in subsequent years.
During 2014 the compensation committee worked with a compensation consultant, Mercer, to review peer practices, evaluate the Rockland SERP and other nonqualified retirement program alternatives, and design and implement a new nonqualified retirement plan for executive officers. On December 11, 2014 the Board, based upon compensation committee recommendations, voted to amend the Company's nonqualified retirement program for executive officers by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Freezing the Rockland SERP by closing it to new participants and making no further adjustments to benefits after confirming the annual benefit for each SERP participant as of December 31, 2014; and,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopting the Rockland Trust Company 401(k) Restoration Plan (the "Restoration Plan") effective as of January 1, 2015. 
[END TABLE]
In freezing the Rockland SERP the Board confirmed and approved the following annual benefits pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Rockland SERP for the executive officer participants, including the named executive 
Independent Bank Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement - 34
Table of Contents officers listed below, as of December 31, 2014, computed as an annual benefit payable under the SERP upon a participant's attainment of age 65, based on a 10 Year Certain Single Life Annuity (as defined in the Rockland SERP):
[BEGIN TABLE]
Participant Annual Benefit Payable 
Christopher Oddleifson $487,427 
Gerard F. Nadeau $169,790 
Edward H. Seksay $120,992 
[END TABLE]
There was no change to the annual Rockland SERP benefits for Mr. Oddleifson, Mr. Nadeau or Mr. Seksay from the annual benefit amount last calculated in 2008 or to the annual Rockland SERP benefits previously established for retired executive officers. Mr. Cozzone and Mr. Jensen are not participants in the Rockland SERP, as they were promoted to executive officer positions when the Board was evaluating the Rockland SERP.
The Restoration Plan is a defined contribution plan intended to restore to each participant the matching and discretionary contributions which would have been made to the existing Rockland Trust 401(k) plan on a participant's behalf but were prohibited due to Internal Revenue Code limitations. The Restoration Plan defines "Compensation" as compensation as defined in Rockland Trust's 401(k) plan, plus annual cash incentive compensation paid during the Plan year, but excluding any discretionary bonuses. The Board approved the participants in the Restoration Plan, including each of our named executive officers and, effective as of January 1, 2015, the making of restoration contributions on their behalf pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Restoration Plan. For Mr. Cozzone and Mr. Jensen, who are not participants in the Rockland SERP, the Board also approved discretionary contributions representing five percent of Compensation (as defined in the Restoration Plan) for each year beginning in 2015 in which each of them participates in the Restoration Plan.
In June 2014, the Board adopted the Independent Bank Corp. and Rockland Trust Company Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan"). The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan permitted certain highly compensated employees of the Company and/or Rockland Trust, a group which includes, but is not limited to, the named executive officers, to defer receipt of all or a portion of their yearly cash incentive awards. Participants were able to defer annual incentive compensation awards commencing with awards paid for the 2014 fiscal year. In January 2018, the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan was amended to permit deferral of annual base salary in addition to yearly cash incentive awards, a feature that was previously in place under the Restoration Plan.
Qualified Retirement Plans for Executive Officers
In 2006, the Company undertook an in depth analysis of Rockland Trust's Defined Benefit Plan which, at that point, provided a normal retirement benefit equal to (a) 2% of final average compensation less (b) 0.65% of covered compensation as defined for Social Security purposes times (c) years of service up to 25. For participants who had completed 20 or more years of service, an additional benefit of 0.5% times final average compensation times service in excess of 25 years, but not exceeding ten additional years, was provided. As a result of the changing demographics of the workplace and the need for predictability of future retirement expenses, on July 1, 2006, benefit accruals under the Defined Benefit Plan were discontinued for all employees. The benefit accruals for all qualified Rockland Trust employees, including the named executive officers, were therefore frozen at that point in time.
After considering alternative plan designs, long term costs, and competitive offerings, a non-discretionary defined contribution benefit was added as of July 1, 2006 to Rockland Trust's existing 401(k) Savings and Stock Ownership Plan. For each plan participant, the Company contributes five percent (5%) of qualified compensation up to the Social Security taxable wage base and ten percent (10%) of amounts in excess of covered compensation up to the maximum Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") limit for qualified plan compensation. These contributions were designed to be consistent with IRS and Employee Retirement Income Security Act safe harbor provisions for non discrimination to non highly compensated employees. Sentinel Benefits, a compensation and benefit consultant firm, provided actuarial and advisory services to assist the Company in the retirement plan decision made in 2006. The defined contribution benefit applies to all qualified Rockland Trust employees, including the named executive officers.
The actuarially determined present values of the named executive officers' retirement benefits as of the end of last year are reported below in the section entitled "Pension Benefits." The holdings of named executive officers in our nonqualified defined contribution plans as of the end of last year are reported below in the section entitled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation."

Employment Agreements
The Company and/or Rockland Trust have entered into employment agreements with the CEO and the other named executive officers, which are summarized below, to ensure the continuity of executive leadership, to clarify the roles and responsibilities of executives, and to make explicit the terms and conditions of executive employment. Provisions concerning a change of control of the Company, and terms of compensation in that event are included in these employment agreements. The change of control language in employment agreements is designed to ensure that executives devote their full energy and attention to the best long term interests of the shareholders in the event that business conditions or external factors make consideration of a change of control appropriate. Each employment agreement contains a one year post-employment nonsolicitation obligation, with the CEO additionally being subject to a one year post-employment noncompetition obligation. Any executive who breaches these covenants forfeits any future payments or benefits.
CEO Employment Agreement
The Company and Rockland Trust have had an employment agreement with Mr. Oddleifson for him to serve as President and CEO of the Company and Rockland Trust since 2003. In accordance with market practices for bank CEO employment agreements in 2003, Mr. Oddleifson's employment agreement provides that he will be entitled to a tax gross up for any amounts paid to him in excess of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G limitations.
The agreement provides that in the event of (i) an involuntary termination of Mr. Oddleifson's employment by the Company or Rockland Trust for reasons other than cause, as defined in the agreement, death or disability, as defined in the agreement, or (ii) a resignation by Mr. Oddleifson for "good reason," as defined in the agreement, Mr. Oddleifson would:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receive, in a lump sum, an amount equal to three times his then current Base Salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be entitled to continue to participate in and receive benefits under the Company's group health and life insurance programs for 18 months;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receive immediate vesting of all stock options which would generally remain exercisable for the three months following termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have continued use of his Company-owned automobile for 18 months; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receive an additional 18 months of service credit in the Rockland SERP. 
[END TABLE]
Resignation for "good reason" under the employment agreement means, among other things, the resignation of Mr. Oddleifson within four months after (i) the Company or Rockland Trust, without the express written consent of Mr. Oddleifson, materially breaches the agreement to his substantial detriment; (ii) the Board of the Company or of Rockland Trust, without cause, substantially changes Mr. Oddleifson's core duties or removes his responsibility for those core duties, so as to effectively cause him to no longer be performing the duties of President and CEO of the Company; or (iii) the Board of the Company or of Rockland Trust without cause, places another executive above Mr. Oddleifson in the Company or Rockland Trust. Mr. Oddleifson is required to give the Company or Rockland Trust 30 business days notice and an opportunity to cure in the case of a resignation for "good reason." 
In the event of a termination of Mr. Oddleifson's employment by the Company due to disability, Mr. Oddleifson would be entitled to be paid an amount equal to the greater of fifty percent of his base salary or any benefits received under the Company's disability insurance program and continued participation for 12 months in insurance programs and an additional twelve months of service credit in the Rockland SERP.
In the event of a termination of Mr. Oddleifson's employment by the Company or Rockland Trust "for cause," as defined in the agreement, Mr. Oddleifson would forfeit benefits under the Rockland SERP and would lose the right to exercise his stock options.

Table of Contents
In the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement, following which Mr. Oddleifson (i) is terminated for reasons other than cause, death or disability, or (ii) resigns from employment for any reason, Mr. Oddleifson is entitled to a lump sum of three years base salary plus three times the greater of (x) the amount of any incentive payment paid out within the 12 months prior to the termination under the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard or (y) the amount of any incentive payment paid out during the 12 months prior to such change of control under the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard, plus continued participation in health and life insurance benefits for a three year period. The Company is obligated to credit and fund three years additional service in the Rockland SERP and Mr. Oddleifson is entitled to a tax gross up for any amounts in excess of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G limitations. 
Executive Officer Employment Agreements
The Company and Rockland Trust (in the case of those individuals who are also officers of the Company) has entered into employment agreements with its other executive officers that are, in substance, virtually identical with the exception that one agreement provides for 24 months of change in control benefits and the other agreements provide for 36 months of change of control benefits.
These agreements generally provide that if an executive officer is terminated involuntarily for any reason other than "cause," as defined in the agreements, death, or disability, as defined in the agreements, or if an executive officer resigns for "good reason," as defined in the agreements, he or she would be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receive his/her then current base salary for 12 months;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• participate in and receive benefits under Rockland Trust's group health and life insurance programs for 12 months or, to receive a payment equal to the cost to Rockland Trust for the executive officer's participation in such plans and benefits with a gross up for taxes; and, 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have all stock options previously granted immediately become fully exercisable and remain exercisable generally for a period of three months following his/her termination. 
[END TABLE]
Resignation for "good reason" under the employment agreements means, among other things, the resignation of an executive officer within four months after (i) Rockland Trust, without the express written consent of the executive officer, materially breaches the agreement to his/her substantial detriment; or (ii) the Rockland Trust Board of Directors, or its President and CEO, without cause, substantially changes the executive officer's core duties or removes his/her responsibility for those core duties, so as to effectively cause him/her to no longer be performing the duties for which he/she was hired. Each executive officer is required to give Rockland Trust 30 business days notice and an opportunity to cure in the case of a resignation for "good reason."
If an executive officer is terminated following a change of control, as defined in the agreements, for any reason other than "cause," death or disability, or if such executive officer resigns from employment for any reason during the 30 day period immediately following the first anniversary of the effective date of a change of control, he/she shall receive a lump sum payment equal to either 24 or 36 months salary, plus a lump sum payment equal to either two or three times the greater of (x) the amount of any incentive payment paid out within the previous 12 months under the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard or (y) the amount of any incentive payment paid out during the 12 months prior to such change of control under the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard. The Company is obligated to credit and fund three (3) years additional service in the Rockland SERP and the executive officer may continue to participate in and receive benefits under Rockland Trust's group health and life insurance programs for either 24 or 36 months or, to the extent such plans or benefits are discontinued and no comparable plans or benefits are established, to receive a payment equal to the cost to Rockland Trust for the executive officer's participation in such plans and benefits with a gross up for taxes. These amounts are subject to the limits of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and will be rolled back to an amount less than the limit. 
CEO and Executive Officer Equity Award Agreements
Through 2017, the time vested restricted stock award agreements that the Company entered into with the CEO and other executive officers provided for the immediate vesting of any unvested restricted stock in the event of an involuntary termination due to death or disability, termination for reasons other than "cause" or resignation for "good reason" as those terms are defined in their employment agreements. In 2018 the Company revised the form of time

Table of Contents vested restricted stock award agreements used for the CEO and other executive officers to provide that, in the event of an involuntary termination due to death or disability, or termination for reasons other than "cause" or resignation for "good reason", the CEO and/or executive officer will vest in the number of shares scheduled to vest in the year of the separation event prorated to reflect the number of days he or she was employed during that year. The performance based restricted stock agreements for the CEO and other executive officers provide that, in the event of an involuntary termination due to death or disability, termination for reasons other than "cause" or resignation for "good reason", as those terms are defined in their employment agreements, an executive officer will vest in the number of shares earned based on actual performance achievement as measured at the end of the performance period, if any, prorated to reflect the number of days he or she was employed during the relevant performance period, with any earned shares to be paid out at the time they are paid out generally to other grantees. The performance based restricted stock agreements for the CEO and other executive officers provide that performance-based shares are forfeited in the event of a termination for "cause" or resignation without "good reason," as those terms are defined in their employment agreements. The time vested restricted stock agreements and performance-based restricted stock agreements for the CEO and other executive officers provide for immediate vesting of equity awards, without regard to either the time vesting schedule or performance achievement, upon a "change in control" as defined by those agreements.    
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure
As required by law we provide the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO, Christopher Oddleifson. As there has been no change in our employee population or compensation arrangements in the past year that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure, we are using the same median employee identified in 2017. For 2017, we selected December 28, 2017 as the date we would use to identify our median employee. As of this date, our employee population consisted of approximately 1,194 individuals, comprised of full-time, part-time, and temporary exempt and non-exempt (i.e., paid hourly) employees. 
To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we compared the amount of salary and wages of our entire employee population as reflected in our payroll records as reported to the IRS on Form W-2 for 2017.
As reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, Mr. Oddleifson had total compensation in 2018 of $2,347,885. In 2018, the annual total compensation of our median employee identified in 2017 was $59,187. Mr. Oddleifson's 2018 annual compensation, therefore, was approximately 40 times that of the median annual compensation for all employees. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules and guidance.
Because the rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the CEO pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the ratio we are reporting.

The portion of the amount in column (e) attributable to performance-based restricted shares represents the value at the grant date assuming the probable outcome of performance conditions, or 90% of target. The value of each named executive officer's performance-based restricted stock award at the grant date assuming the highest level of performance achievement, or maximum value, is as follows: Mr. Oddleifson, $444,850, Mr. Cozzone, $157,850, Mr. Jensen, $86,100, Mr. Nadeau, $179,375, Mr. Seksay, $93,275.

(1) The amounts reported in the Target column represent each named executive officer's Target Award under the Executive Incentive Plan Scorecard. The amounts reported in the Threshold column were calculated for each named executive officer assuming that threshold performance was attained for both the Company Performance and Peer Performance Adjustment Factors and, other than for our CEO, assuming the Individual Performance Factor was attained at 100%. The amounts reported in the Maximum column were calculated for each named executive officer assuming that maximum performance was attained for both the Company Performance and Peer Performance Adjustment Factors and the Individual Performance Factor was attained at the maximum of 140% (or in the case of our CEO, the maximum of 1.20 times the amount equal to the product of his Target Award multiplied by the maximum Bank Performance Adjustment Factor). See column (g) in the Summary Compensation Table for the actual incentive award paid to each named executive officer.
(2) These amounts represent the threshold, target and maximum number of shares that each named executive officer may earn with respect to the performance-based restricted share awards granted in 2018 subject to achievement of specified levels of ROATE as compared to the peer group as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under Performance-Based and Time Vested Restricted Stock Awards.
(3) The grant date fair value per share for these performance-based and time-based restricted stock awards was $71.75.

PENSION BENEFITS
The Rockland Trust SERP Participation Agreements provide for an annual benefit payable at age 65 to the executive upon termination of employment at age 62 or later. Should the executive terminate employment prior to age 62, the benefit is prorated based on the executive's benefit service as of employment termination relative to the executive's projected benefit service at age 65. The present value of the accumulated benefit shown in the table has been calculated assuming the executive terminated employment as of December 31, 2018 and the executive will start receiving his or her pension at age 65. The assumptions used for the Rockland SERP are those required under U.S. GAAP, including a discount rate of 4.09% which is based on the investment yield of high quality corporate bonds available in the market place as determined by the FTSE Pension Liability Index as well as post-retirement mortality according to the White Collar RP-2014 Mortality Table with Scale MP-2018. The discount rate used for computing the Defined Benefit Plan present value of accumulated benefit is 4.22%, which is based on the FTSE Pension Liability Index as of December 31, 2018. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Defined Benefit Plan and Rockland SERP were frozen for purposes of benefit accrual in 2006 and 2014, respectively. In freezing the SERP, the Board approved annual benefit amounts under the SERP for Messrs. Oddleifson, Nadeau and Seksay on a 10 year certain single life annuity, as discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
The following table provides details of the present value of the accumulated benefit and years of credited service for the named executive officers under the Company's qualified and nonqualified retirement programs as of December 31, 2018.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
As discussed above in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under "Retirement Plans - Nonqualified Retirement Plans for Executive Officers," in June 2014 our Board adopted the Independent Bank Corp. and Rockland Trust Company Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan and in December 2014 adopted the Rockland Trust Company 401(k) Restoration Plan.
Restoration Plan. The Restoration Plan is a defined contribution plan intended to restore to each participant the matching and discretionary contributions which would have been made to the existing tax qualified Rockland Trust 401(k) plan on a participant's behalf but were prohibited due to Internal Revenue Code limitations.
The Restoration Plan defines "Compensation" as compensation as defined in Rockland Trust's 401(k) plan, plus annual cash incentive compensation paid during the Plan year, but excluding any discretionary bonuses. The Board approved the participants in the Restoration Plan, including each of our named executive officers and, effective as of January 1, 2015, the making of restoration contributions on their behalf pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Restoration Plan.
Company contributions to the Rockland Trust 401(k) plan are restricted by IRS limits on compensation into qualified plans. The Restoration Plan restores the Company contributions into the 401(k) plan, which were limited as a result of the IRS compensation limits. The Restoration Plan incorporates the following Company contributions, consistent with the 401(k) plan: the Company match, calculated at 25% of the first 6% of deferrals; the Company non-elective contribution of 5% of salary up to the Social Security taxable wage base; and, the Company supplemental non-elective contribution of 10% of salary from the Social Security taxable wage base up to the IRS compensation limit. The Company contributions into the 401(k) Plan limited by the IRS compensation limits, in addition to the Company contributions on the annual incentive compensation, are to be funded into the participant's Restoration Plan account on an annual basis.
The Restoration Plan also provides for additional, discretionary contributions, as approved by the Board. Additional discretionary contributions have been approved for Mr. Cozzone and Mr. Jensen and are described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under "Retirement Plans - Nonqualified Retirement Plans for Executive Officers".
Restoration Plan participants have the right to direct the investment of their account balance by choosing from among investment alternatives made available by the plan administrator, including Company stock. Each participant's account under the plan will be credited with earnings or losses arising from investment performance. A participant's account balance will be paid out, subject to plan terms, upon a separation from service, or upon death or disability, in a lump sum unless the participant has elected annual installment payments.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan permits certain highly compensated employees of the Company and/or Rockland Trust, a group determined by the compensation committee which includes, but is not limited to, the named executive officers, to defer receipt of all or a portion of their annual cash incentive award. In January 2018, the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan was amended to permit deferral of annual base salary in addition to annual cash incentive awards, a feature that was previously in place under the Restoration Plan. No other forms of compensation are eligible for deferral under this plan. The compensation committee administers the plan and annually selects the employees who are eligible to participate. Each participant has the right to direct investment of their account balance by choosing from among the investment alternatives made available by the plan administrator, and each account will be credited with earnings or losses arising from investment performance of the selected investment alternatives. A participant's account balance will be paid out, subject to plan terms, upon a separation from service, or upon death or disability, in a lump sum payment unless the participant has elected annual installment payments.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive officers and directors, and holders of 10% or more of the Company's common stock, to file reports on Forms 3, 4, and 5 with the SEC to indicate ownership and changes in ownership of common stock with the SEC and to furnish the Company with copies of those reports. Based solely upon a review of those reports and any amendments thereto, the Company believes that, during the year ended December 31, 2018, filing requirements under Section 16(a) were complied with in a timely fashion, except for the following: In July 2018, one of the Company's former directors, Carl Ribeiro, sold 1,000 shares of common stock.  Due to an inadvertent error, this transaction was reported on a late Form 4.
