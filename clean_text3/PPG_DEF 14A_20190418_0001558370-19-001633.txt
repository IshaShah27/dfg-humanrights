[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
PROPOSAL 1: Election of Directors to Serve in a Class Whose Term Expires in 2022
Four directors are nominated for election to a class that will serve until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified, or their earlier retirement or resignation. It is intended that the shares represented by each proxy will be voted, in the discretion of the proxies, FOR the nominees for directors set forth below, each of whom is an incumbent, or for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by our Board of Directors in the event any nominee or nominees become unavailable for election. In the event that an incumbent director receives a greater number of votes against his election than votes for such election, he is required to tender his resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors in accordance with our Bylaws, as described on page 17 under "Director Resignation Policy." The principal occupations of, and certain other information regarding, the nominees and our continuing directors are set forth below. In addition, information about each director's specific experience, attributes and skills that led the Board to the conclusion that each of the directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board is set forth below. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that any director who has attained the age of 72 retire at the next annual meeting following the director's 72nd birthday. In accordance with this policy, if elected, Mr. Berges will retire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
The Board believes that each of the Company's directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board. Each of our directors has contributed to the mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications of the Board. Our directors are highly educated and have diverse backgrounds and talents and extensive track records of success in what we believe are highly relevant positions with some of the most admired organizations in the world. Many of our directors also benefit from an intimate knowledge of our operations and corporate philosophy. The Board believes that each director's service as the chairman, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, president or group president of a well‑respected company has provided the directors with skills that are important to serving on our Board. The Board has also considered the fact that all of our directors have worked for, or served on the boards of directors of, a variety of companies in a wide range of industries. Specifically, the Board has noted that our directors have skills that, among others, have made them particularly suited to serve as a director of PPG, a global manufacturer of high technology paints, coatings and specialty materials for industrial and consumer markets, with operations in more than 70 countries. The Board believes that through their varying backgrounds, our directors bring a wealth of experiences, new ideas and solutions to our Board.
Vote Required
Each director nominee who receives a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted "for" the director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director) at the Annual Meeting will be elected as a director.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Composition, Refreshment and Diversity
PPG's business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board is currently comprised of 11 members, divided into three classes. Terms of the classes are staggered, with one class standing for election each year. The Board has placed on the ballot for the Annual Meeting a proposal to amend PPG's Articles of Incorporation to provide for the annual election of all directors. Please see Proposal 4 for more information. The Board is elected by our shareholders to oversee management of the Company in the long‑term interests of all shareholders. The Board also considers the interests of other constituencies, which include customers, employees, retirees, suppliers, the communities we serve and the environment. The Board strives to ensure that PPG conducts business in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and integrity.
The Board seeks to maintain an appropriate balance of directors with varying tenure, diversity and skills. The Nominating and Governance Committee continually evaluates potential director candidates with the goal of finding directors whose skills complement the skills of PPG's current directors, who add to the expertise of the Board as a whole and who have experience to contribute insight into our strategy. Using a skills matrix that includes the experience and skills of our current directors and keeping in mind the skills that the Board believes would add to the capabilities and knowledge of our Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reviews the skills and experience of our directors and potential director candidates. More information about the skills and experience of our directors and director appointees can be found in the matrix on page 4 and within the biographies of our directors and director appointees beginning on page 6.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that any director who has attained the age of 72 retire at the next annual meeting following the director's 72nd birthday. Four new directors have joined the Board since 2015, and in this proxy statement we are asking shareholders to approve the appointment of two new directors. Since the end of 2012, the average age of our directors has remained 64 and our average director tenure has remained approximately 10 years.
The Nominating and Governance Committee does not a have formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates. However, we endeavor to have a Board representing diverse experience at policy‑making levels in business, government, education and technology, and in areas that are relevant to the Company's global activities. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to find director candidates who have demonstrated executive leadership ability and who are representative of the broad scope of shareholder interests by identifying candidates from diverse industries having diverse cultural backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds, viewpoints and ages. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that the current members of the Board provide this diversity as five of our 11 directors and both of our director appointees (subject to shareholder approval) are diverse based on gender, ethnicity and cultural background.
Shareholder Engagement
Through engagement with our shareholders, the Board and our senior management team are provided with feedback on a variety of topics, including strategic and financial performance, operations, corporate governance, executive compensation, Board composition, and environmental and social issues. These constructive engagements enable the Board and management to evaluate and assess our company from different perspectives and viewpoints. During 2018, one or more members of management met with active, institutional investors representing approximately 80% of our outstanding shares. In addition, members of management held governance-focused meetings with active, institutional investors representing approximately 45% of our outstanding shares. Our Lead Director, Hugh Grant, participated in a number of these governance-focused meetings. The key themes of feedback received during our engagement meetings as well as efforts we are taking in consideration of the feedback we received were shared with the Board. These initiatives help to ensure that the Board is apprised of key trends and topics being considered by our shareholders.
Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board Self-Evaluation and Board Orientation
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines are revised from time to time to better address particular needs as they change over time. In 2014, the Board revised the Corporate Governance Guidelines to include additional responsibilities for the Company's Lead Director. In 2015, the Board revised the Corporate Governance Guidelines to better delineate the responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board and those of the Chief Executive Officer. The Corporate Governance Guidelines may be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor.

The Board annually evaluates its own performance and that of the individual committees. The evaluation process is coordinated by the Nominating and Governance Committee and has three parts: committee self‑assessments, full Board evaluations and evaluations of the individual directors in the class whose term is expiring at the next annual meeting. The committee self‑assessments consider whether and how well each committee has performed the responsibilities listed in its charter. The full Board evaluations consider the committee self‑assessments, as well as the quality of the Board's meeting agendas, materials and discussions. All assessments and evaluations focus on both strengths and opportunities for improvement and are shared with the Board.
The Board has a program for orienting new directors which includes presentations from members of senior management regarding our operations, governance, finances and compensation programs. The Company also provides for continuing education for all directors, including the reimbursement of expenses for continuing education.
Director Independence
In accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director or appointment in accordance with the categorical guidelines it has adopted, which include all objective standards of independence set forth in the exchange listing standards. Based on these standards, at its meeting held on February 21, 2019, the Board determined that each of the following non‑employee directors and director appointees is independent and has no material relationship with PPG, except as a director and shareholder:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Stephen F. Angel    Gary R. Heminger  
  James G. Berges    Melanie L. Healey  
  Steven A. Davis    Michele J. Hooper  
  John V. Faraci    Michael W. Lamach  
  Hugh Grant    Martin H. Richenhagen  
  Victoria F. Haynes    Catherine R. Smith  
[END TABLE]
In addition, based on such standards, the Board affirmatively determined that Michael H. McGarry is not independent because he is an officer of PPG. The categorical independence standards adopted by the Board are contained in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which may be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor.
Board Leadership Structure 
We believe our Board leadership structure provides the appropriate balance of independent directors and management directors. We have a traditional board leadership structure under which Mr. McGarry serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. We currently have ten other directors, each of whom is independent. Our Board has four standing committees, each of which is comprised solely of independent directors with a committee chair. The Board believes that Mr. McGarry is the best person to serve as Chairman because he is the director most familiar with our business and industry and the director most capable of identifying strategic priorities and executing our business strategy. The Board believes the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves as a highly effective bridge between the Board and management and provides the leadership to execute our business strategy and create shareholder value.
In addition, having one person serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer demonstrates to our employees, suppliers, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders that PPG has strong leadership setting the tone and having the responsibility for managing our operations. Having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for PPG. We believe that our Board consists of directors with significant leadership skills, as discussed above. All of our independent directors have served as the chairman, chief executive officer, president or group president of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that our independent directors have demonstrated leadership in large enterprises and are well versed in board processes and that having directors with significant leadership skills benefits our Company and our shareholders.
In accordance with our Bylaws and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Chairman is responsible for chairing Board meetings and setting the agenda for these meetings. Each director also may suggest items for inclusion on the agenda and may raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our independent directors meet separately, without management present, at each meeting of the Board. In addition, each of the Board's standing committees regularly meets without members of management present.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  16    2019 Proxy Statement           						   
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
The Board has designated the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee to serve as the Lead Director. In their discretion, the independent directors may select another independent director to serve as the Lead Director. Aside from chairing meetings of the independent directors, the Lead Director presides at all meetings where the Chairman is not present, serves as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has the power to call meetings of the independent directors, consults with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer about the concerns of the Board, approves Board meeting agendas and other types of information sent to the Board, approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items, and is available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders as appropriate.
As part of its annual self‑evaluation process, the Board evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it provides the optimal structure for PPG. We believe that having a director with day‑to‑day oversight of Company operations, coupled with experienced independent directors who have appointed a Lead Director and four wholly-independent board committees, is the appropriate leadership structure for PPG.
The Board's Role in Risk Management
In accordance with New York Stock Exchange requirements, our Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our risk management process. The Audit Committee is updated on a regular basis on relevant and significant risk areas. This includes periodic updates from certain officers of the Company and a formal annual update by the Director of Corporate Audit Services. The annual update provides a comprehensive review of PPG's enterprise risks and includes the feedback of most of the Company's officers. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to the full Board. While the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, our entire Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company by engaging in periodic discussions with Company officers and other employees as the Board may deem appropriate. In 2018, the Board spent additional time reviewing our cybersecurity program. In addition, each of our Board committees considers the risks within its areas of responsibility. For example, our Technology and Environment Committee considers risks related to our environment, health, safety, product stewardship and other sustainability policies, programs and practices. Our Audit Committee focuses on risks inherent in our accounting, financial reporting, cybersecurity and internal controls. Our Officers—Directors Compensation Committee considers the risks that may be implicated by our executive compensation program. We believe that the leadership structure of our Board supports the Board's effective oversight of the Company's risk management.
Director Resignation Policy
Our Bylaws provide that if an incumbent director is not elected by majority vote in an "uncontested election" (where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), the director must offer to tender his or her resignation to our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision with respect to their resignation. The election of directors that will be held at the 2019 Annual Meeting is an uncontested election.
Executive Succession Planning
One of the Board's primary responsibilities is to oversee the development of appropriate executive-level talent to successfully execute PPG's strategy. Management succession is regularly discussed by the Board with Mr. McGarry and with PPG's Vice President, Human Resources. The Board reviews candidates for all executive officer positions to confirm that qualified successor-candidates are available for all key positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of successor-candidates. At least annually, as required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and typically more often, the Board's discusses CEO succession planning. Mr. McGarry provides the Board with recommendations for and evaluations of potential CEO successors and reviews with the Board development plans for these successors. Directors engage with potential CEO and senior management talent at Board and committee meetings and in less formal settings to enable directors to personally interact with candidates. The Board reviews management succession in the ordinary course of business as well as contingency planning in the event of an emergency or unanticipated event.

Board Oversight of PPG's Strategy
PPG's Board is actively engaged in developing our strategy and overseeing the execution of our strategy, including major business and organizational initiatives, capital allocation priorities and potential business development opportunities. The Board devotes at least one full day each year to reviewing and formulating our strategy. Throughout the year, the Board uses its experience in manufacturing, global business, science and technology and marketing to oversee the execution of our strategy and capital allocation and works with senior management to guide our strategy.
Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
The Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee have adopted written policies and procedures relating to approval or ratification of "Related Person Transactions." Under these policies and procedures, the Nominating and Governance Committee (or its chair, under some circumstances) reviews the relevant facts of all proposed Related Person Transactions and either approves or disapproves of the entry into the Related Person Transaction, by taking into account, among other factors it deems appropriate:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The benefits to PPG of the transaction; 
· The impact on a director's independence, in the event the "Related Person" is a director or an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; 
· The availability of other sources for comparable products or services; 
· The terms of the transaction; and 
· The terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. 
[END TABLE]
No director may participate in any consideration or approval of a Related Person Transaction with respect to which he or she or any of his or her immediate family members is the Related Person. Related Person Transactions are approved only if they are determined to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of PPG and its shareholders.
If a Related Person Transaction that has not been previously approved or previously ratified is discovered, the Nominating and Governance Committee, or its chair, will promptly consider all of the relevant facts. In addition, the committee generally reviews all ongoing Related Person Transactions on an annual basis to determine whether to continue, modify or terminate the Related Person Transaction.
Under our policies and procedures, a "Related Person Transaction" is generally a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which PPG was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A "Related Person" is generally any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of PPG's last fiscal year was, (i) a director or executive officer of PPG or a nominee to become a director of PPG; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of PPG's voting securities; or (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons.

*      Committee Chair
During 2018, the Board of Directors held eight regular and three special meetings, the Audit Committee held 10 meetings, the Nominating and Governance Committee held seven meetings, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee held four meetings, and the Technology and Environment Committee held three meetings. The average attendance at meetings of the Board and committees during 2018 was 99%, and no incumbent director attended less than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which such director served. PPG does not have a formal policy requiring attendance at the annual meeting of shareholders; however, all directors serving at the time of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders attended the meeting.
Our independent directors meet separately, without any management present, at each meeting of the Board. The Board has designated the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee to serve as the Lead Director and to preside over the independent director sessions. In their discretion, the independent directors may select another independent director to serve as the Lead Director.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of five directors, each of whom is independent under the standards adopted by the Board, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The committee's charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non‑employee directors. The functions of the committee are primarily to review with our independent auditors and our internal auditors their respective reports and recommendations concerning audit findings and the scope of and plans for their future audit programs and to review audits, annual and quarterly financial statements and accounting and financial controls. The committee also appoints our independent registered public accounting firm, oversees our internal audit department, assists the Board in oversight of our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to financial reporting matters and oversees the risk management process. The Board has determined that each member of the committee is "financially literate" in accordance with the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Board has determined that all of the members of the committee, including Mr. Richenhagen, the chair of the committee, are "audit committee financial experts" in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Audit Committee Report to Shareholders
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to oversee and review on behalf of the Board of Directors PPG's processes to provide for the reliability and integrity of the Company's financial reporting, including the Company's disclosure practices, risk management processes and internal controls. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     						         2019 Proxy Statement    19  
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of both the independent registered public accounting firm and PPG's lead internal auditor, the Director of Corporate Audit Services. In 2016, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of a new Director of Corporate Audit Services. In 2018, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of an interim Director of Corporate Audit Services when the then current Director of Corporate Audit Services was named the Acting Controller, and the Audit Committee then participated in the appointment of a new Director of Corporate Audit Services. In addition, the Audit Committee led the appointment and retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as PPG's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 and participated in the selection process for a new lead audit partner due to the required rotation of PPG's current lead audit partner after completion of the 2017 audit. For the work performed on the 2018 audit, the Audit Committee discussed and evaluated PricewaterhouseCoopers' performance, which included an evaluation by the Company's management of PricewaterhouseCoopers' performance. The Audit Committee is responsible for the compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm and has reviewed and approved in advance all services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The Audit Committee discussed with, and received regular status reports from, the Director of Corporate Audit Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers on the overall scope and plans for their audits, their plans for evaluating the effectiveness of PPG's internal control over financial reporting and the coordination of efforts between them. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the key risk factors used in developing PPG's internal audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit plans. The Audit Committee also reviewed with the Company's management PPG's risk management practices and an assessment of significant risks.
The Audit Committee met separately with both the Director of Corporate Audit Services and PricewaterhouseCoopers, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their audits of PPG's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of PPG's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also met separately with the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and with the Company's Senior Vice President and General Counsel. The Audit Committee annually reviews its performance and receives feedback on its performance from the Company's management and PricewaterhouseCoopers, when appropriate.
The Company's management is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of PPG's financial statements. The Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. In 2018, PPG's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of PPG's internal control over financial reporting.
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the Company's management the process to assemble the financial statements, including the Company's internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.
In 2018, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of outside counsel and forensic accountants, oversaw an investigation into certain accounting irregularities that resulted in PPG restating its audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and certain quarterly periods within those fiscal years in order to correct PPG's previously issued financial statements. In connection with the preparation of the Company's 2018 financial statements, management has determined that material weakness identified in the Company's internal control over financial reporting has been remediated.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and management's report on internal control over financial reporting with management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Audit Committee also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the matters required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees.
The Audit Committee has received the written independence disclosures and letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers its independence. In addition, the Audit Committee considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers' provision of non‑audit services to PPG is compatible with maintaining its independence.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of our previous filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that incorporate future filings, including this Proxy Statement, in whole or in part, the foregoing Audit Committee Report to Shareholders shall not be incorporated by reference into any such filings.
Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance Committee is comprised of five directors, each of whom is independent under the standards adopted by the Board and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The committee's charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non‑employee directors. The charter also provides that the committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board of Directors persons to be nominated by the Board to stand for election as directors at each annual meeting of shareholders, the persons to be elected by the Board to fill any vacancy or vacancies on the Board, and the persons to be elected by the Board to be Chairman of the Board, Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, President, if any, and the other executive officers of PPG. The committee also recommends to the Board actions to be taken regarding the structure, organization and functioning of the Board, and the persons to serve as members of the standing committees of, and other committees appointed by, the Board. The charter gives the committee the responsibility to develop and recommend corporate governance guidelines to the Board, to recommend to the Board the process and criteria to be used in evaluating the performance of the Board and to oversee the evaluation of the Board.
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and screening potential director candidates and for recommending to the Board qualified candidates for nomination. The committee considers recommendations of potential candidates from current directors, management and shareholders. The committee also has authority to retain and terminate search firms to assist in identifying director candidates. From time to time, search firms have been paid a fee to identify candidates. In February 2019, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Davis and Ms. Smith as directors of PPG subject to approval by the Company's shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Mr. Davis was initially identified as a potential nominee by Mr. Heminger. Following an interview process undertaken by Mr. McGarry, Mr. Grant and a number of other directors and a review of his candidacy by the Nominating and Governance Committee, Mr. Davis was recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee as an appointee for election to the Board. Ms. Smith was initially identified as a potential nominee by Mr. McGarry and Ms. Healey. Mr. McGarry interviewed Ms. Smith and invited her to meet with other members of the Board. Following meetings with a number of other directors and a review of her candidacy by the Nominating and Governance Committee, Ms. Smith was recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee as an appointee for election to the Board.
Director Candidate Attributes.  In evaluating director candidates, the committee looks for candidate having the skills that the Board believes would add to the capabilities and knowledge of our Board, including the skills and attributes set forth below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· age shall be considered only in terms of experience of the candidate, seeking candidates who have broad experience in business, finance, the sciences, administration, government affairs or law; 
· candidates for director should have knowledge of the global operations of industrial and retail businesses such as those of PPG; 
· candidates for director should be cognizant of PPG's societal responsibilities in conducting its operations; 
· each candidate should have sufficient time available to be a meaningful participant in Board affairs. Candidates should not be considered if there is either a legal impediment to service or a foreseeable conflict of interest which might materially hamper full and objective participation in all matters considered by the Board of Directors; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     						         2019 Proxy Statement    21  
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
· absent unforeseen health problems, each candidate should be able to serve as director for a sufficient period of time to make a meaningful contribution to the Board's guidance of PPG's affairs; and 
· the Board will be comprised of a majority of independent directors. 
[END TABLE]
In applying these criteria, the committee seeks to establish a Board that, when taken as a whole, should:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· be representative of the broad scope of shareholder interests, without orientation to any particular constituencies; 
· challenge management, in a constructive way, to reach PPG's goals and objectives; 
· be sensitive to the cultural and geographical diversity of shareholders, associates, operations and interests; 
· be comprised principally of active or retired senior executives of publicly held corporations or financial institutions, with consideration given to those individuals who are scientifically‑oriented, educators and government officials having corporate experience, whenever the needs of PPG indicate such membership would be appropriate; 
· include directors of varying ages, but whose overriding credentials reflect maturity, experience, insight and prominence in the community; and 
· be small enough to promote open and meaningful boardroom discussion, but large enough to staff the necessary Board committees. 
[END TABLE]
Shareholder Recommendations or Nominations for Director and Proxy Access
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers recommendations of potential candidates from shareholders. Candidates recommended by shareholders are evaluated against the same criteria used to evaluate all candidates. Shareholders wishing to recommend or nominate a nominee for director should send their recommendation or nomination to the corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272.
PPG's Bylaws provide for "proxy access." Proxy access is a process that allows an eligible shareholder or a group of eligible shareholders to nominate director candidates to appear in PPG's proxy materials. Proxy access is available to shareholders or groups consisting of no more than 20 shareholders that have held at least 3% of PPG's outstanding stock for at least three years and who have met the other requirements set forth in Article I of PPG's Bylaws. A shareholder recommendation or nomination of a director candidate must be submitted by the deadlines and with the information and written representations that are described in Article I of our Bylaws. Director nominations submitted pursuant to PPG's proxy access Bylaw for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by PPG no earlier than October 9, 2019 and no later than November 8, 2019. A copy of PPG's Bylaws may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor.
Officers—Directors Compensation Committee
The Officers—Directors Compensation Committee is comprised of five directors, each of whom is independent under the standards adopted by the Board and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The committee's charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. Among other things, the charter provides that the committee will be comprised of independent, non‑employee directors.
Committee meetings are regularly attended by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President of Human Resources, as well as a representative of the outside compensation consulting firm retained by the committee, FW Cook. At each meeting, the committee meets in executive session. The committee's chair reports the committee's recommendations on executive compensation to the Board. The human resources department supports the committee in its duties and, along with the Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee, a committee comprised of members of senior management, may be delegated authority to fulfill certain administrative duties regarding our compensation programs. The committee has authority under its charter to retain, approve fees for and terminate advisors, consultants and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities.
The committee approves, adopts, administers, interprets, amends, suspends and terminates our compensation plans applicable to, and fixes the compensation and benefits of, all of our directors and executive officers. Recommendations regarding compensation of other officers are made by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The conclusions reached and recommendations based on these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and annual award amounts, are presented to the committee. The committee can exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to executives. The committee regularly reviews tally sheets that set forth the Company's total

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents compensation obligations to our senior executives under various scenarios, including retirement, voluntary and involuntary termination and termination in connection with a change in control of PPG.
The committee engaged FW Cook to advise the committee on all matters related to executive officer and director compensation. Specifically, FW Cook provides relevant market data, current updates regarding trends in executive and director compensation, and advice on program design, specific compensation recommendations for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and on the recommendations being made by management for executives other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The committee meets independently with its consultant at each regularly scheduled meeting. All of the services that the compensation consultant performs for PPG are performed at the request of the committee, are related to executive and director compensation and are in support of decision making by the committee.
In 2018, the committee considered the independence of FW Cook in light of Securities and Exchange Commission rules and New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The committee requested and received a letter from FW Cook addressing FW Cook's and the senior advisor involved in the engagement's independence, including the following factors: (1) other services provided to us by FW Cook; (2) fees paid by us as a percentage of FW Cook's total revenue; (3) policies or procedures maintained by FW Cook that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between the senior advisor and a member of the committee; (5) any company stock owned by FW Cook or the senior advisor; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and FW Cook or the senior advisor. The committee discussed these considerations and concluded that the work performed by FW Cook and FW Cook's senior advisor involved in the engagement did not raise any conflict of interest.
Officers—Directors Compensation Committee Report to Shareholders
We have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement with management. Based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated in the Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk
Annually, PPG management undertakes a review of all of PPG's compensation programs to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Certain of these compensation programs are also periodically reviewed by the Company's internal auditors. The framework used to identify any potential risks that could be incentivized by our compensation programs was developed with input from members of our human resources, finance, and legal functions and our independent executive compensation consultant, FW Cook. Based on the results of the 2018 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long‑term value of PPG. Features of our compensation programs and practices that mitigate risk include, among other things: (i) incentive plans that are appropriately weighted between short‑term and long‑term performance and cash and equity; (ii) long‑term incentives that consist of a mix of stock options, performance‑based restricted stock units and total shareholder return contingent shares, which provides for a balanced mix of performance measures; (iii) ranges of performance and multiple performance targets are utilized to determine incentive compensation payouts, rather than a single performance target that provides an "all or nothing" basis for compensation; (iv) maximum payouts are in place in our incentive compensation programs to limit excessive payments; (v) determination of incentive compensation payouts is subject to managerial approval and/or Officers—Directors Compensation Committee discretion; and (vi) our executive officers are subject to a recoupment policy in the event of a financial restatement affecting their incentive compensation payout.

Technology and Environment Committee
The Technology and Environment Committee is comprised of five directors, each of whom is independent under the standards adopted by the Board. The committee's charter, which may be accessed on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor, describes the composition, purposes and responsibilities of the committee. The primary purpose of the committee is to discharge certain of the Board's responsibilities relating to the oversight of programs, initiatives and activities of PPG in the areas of science, technology and sustainability. The functions of the committee are primarily to assess the science and technology capabilities of PPG in all phases of its activities in relation to its corporate strategies and plans; review with management the existing and emerging technologies, and environment, health, safety, product stewardship and other sustainability issues, that can have a material impact on PPG; and review the status of our environment, health, safety, product stewardship and other sustainability policies, programs and practices. More information about PPG's sustainability goals, metrics, initiatives and achievements and PPG's community and employee engagement programs can be found in PPG's sustainability website located at www.sustainability.ppg.com.
Codes of Ethics
Our Global Code of Ethics, which was updated in 2017, is applicable to all directors and employees worldwide, embodies our global principles and practices relating to the ethical conduct of our business and our long‑standing commitment to honesty, fair dealing and compliance with all laws affecting our business. We also have a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that is applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller or persons performing similar functions. The Global Code of Ethics and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers are available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law, the Form 8‑K rules or the New York Stock Exchange listing standards concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of our codes.
The Board has established a means for employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders or other interested parties to submit confidential and anonymous reports of suspected or actual violations of our Global Code of Ethics. Any employee, shareholder or other interested party can call the PPG Ethics HELPLINE toll‑free to submit a report. In North America, this number is (800) 461-9330.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Overview
The compensation program for the directors who are not also officers of PPG, to whom we refer as non‑employee directors, is reviewed annually by the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee to ensure that the program remains competitive. As a part of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee's review, the types and levels of compensation offered to our non‑employee directors are compared with those provided by a select group of comparable companies. Target total annual compensation for our directors is set at or near the market median using a comparator group of companies. The companies comprising this comparator group are used for review of the executive officer compensation program as well. The comparator group used in 2017 to set 2018 compensation was:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3M Company    Eastman Chemical Company    Honeywell  International Inc.    Parker‑Hannifin Corporation  
  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.    Eaton Corporation    Illinois Tool Works Inc.    Praxair, Inc.  
  Arconic Inc.    Ecolab Inc.    International Paper Company    The Sherwin‑Williams Company  
  The Dow Chemical Company    Emerson Electric Co.    Johnson Controls, Inc.    Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.  
  E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company    Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company    Monsanto Company    Textron Inc.  
[END TABLE]
Taking into consideration the size of PPG relative to this comparator group and advice from FW Cook, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee reports its recommendations to the Board for approval. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee does not determine director compensation, but only makes recommendations to the Board. Changes to the non‑employee directors' compensation program generally become effective as of the year following adoption.

    (1)      Fees include an annual cash retainer of $135,000, plus an additional cash retainer for each committee chair and for the Lead Director. For 2018, the annual retainer for service as a committee chair or as the Lead Director was as follows: $25,000 for the chair of the Audit Committee; $25,000 for the Lead Director; $20,000 for the chair of each of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee; and $15,000 for the chair of the Technology and Environment Committee.   
    (2)      In April 2018, each director received 1,227 time-based restricted stock units, or RSUs. The RSUs will vest on April 17, 2019 and the grant date fair value of each RSU grant was $110.10. Dollar values represent the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The assumptions made in calculating the grant date fair values are set forth in Note 18 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is located on pages 86 through 88 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2018, each director had 1,227 unvested RSUs.

    (3)      Amounts in this column reflect donations made by the PPG Industries Foundation under our charitable awards program. The PPG Industries Foundation matches up to $10,000 of donations made by a director in any one year. However, matching payments by the PPG Industries Foundation may be paid in a year subsequent to the donation depending on the timing of the director's donation during the year and the timing of the PPG Industries Foundation's verification process.  This may result in matching payments that exceed $10,000 in one year. For additional information regarding charitable awards, see "Charitable Awards Program" on page 27. 
[END TABLE]
Annual Retainer
For 2018, each of our non‑employee directors received an annual retainer with a value equal to $270,000, of which $135,000 was paid in cash and $135,000 in equity in the form of time‑based restricted stock units, or TBRSUs. The cash portion of the retainer was payable in quarterly installments, with the first quarterly installment paid after the annual shareholders meeting. The number of TBRSUs a director received was determined by dividing $135,000 by the weighted average closing price of our stock on the grant date, which was the date of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. A TBRSU represents the right to receive a share of PPG common stock upon vesting and earns dividend equivalents during the vesting period when dividends are declared on PPG common stock, but does not carry voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of PPG common stock. TBRSUs granted in 2018 vest on the day prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Beginning in 2019, the annual retainer will increase to $280,000, of which $135,000 will be paid in cash and $145,000 will be paid in equity in the form of TBRSUs.
Additional Retainers for Committee Chairs and the Lead Director
In addition to the annual retainer for each non‑employee director, each non‑employee director who chairs a Board standing committee is entitled to an additional annual cash retainer, which is payable at the same time as the regular annual retainer. The Officers—Directors Compensation Committee also determined to begin paying an additional cash retainer to the Lead Director beginning in 2018 in recognition of the additional time and effort required by the Lead Director in his role, including, among other responsibilities, planning Board meetings, meeting with management and engaging with our shareholders. For 2018, the additional annual retainer for service as a committee chair or as the Lead Director was:

  Officers—Directors Compensation         $     20,000  
  Technology and Environment         $     15,000  
[END TABLE]
Insurance Coverage
We pay the premiums to provide each of our non‑employee directors with the following insurance coverage:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage, which provides $250,000 for accidental loss of life, and up to 100% of the death benefit for loss of limb. The aggregate cost to PPG of providing this coverage to non‑employee directors for 2018 was $1,664; and 
· PPG aircraft travel insurance coverage, which provides up to a $1,000,000 per seat voluntary settlement allowance, for travel on a PPG‑owned aircraft, and a reduced amount for travel on a PPG leased or chartered aircraft. The aggregate cost to PPG of providing this coverage to non‑employee directors for 2018 was $17,105. 
[END TABLE]
Deferred Compensation
A non‑employee director may elect to have all or a portion of his or her retainer fees (including fees payable in TBRSUs) credited to the PPG Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, thus deferring receipt of such fees until after the director leaves the Board. All amounts held in a director's account under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited as hypothetical shares of our stock, or what we refer to as common stock equivalents, the number of which is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the deferral by the closing stock price of PPG common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the deferral. Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents (that are converted into additional common stock equivalents) when dividends are declared on PPG common stock, but do not carry voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of PPG common stock. Each non‑employee director will generally be paid his or her deferred compensation account balance no earlier than six months and ten days after leaving the 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Board of Directors, except in circumstances of death or disability, in which case payment shall be made as soon as administratively possible. Each non‑employee director's account balance related to compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2005 will be paid in a lump sum; however, a non‑employee director may elect to receive payment of his or her account balance related to compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2005 in one to 15 annual installments. All distributions are made in the form of one share of PPG common stock for each common stock equivalent credited to the director's deferred account (and cash as to any fractional common stock equivalents).
Charitable Awards Program
As part of our overall program to promote charitable giving, we established a directors' charitable award program funded by insurance policies on the lives of directors who were initially elected before July 17, 2003. Upon the death of any of these directors, PPG will donate an amount up to and including a total of $1 million to one or more qualifying charitable organizations designated by any such director and approved by PPG. We will be reimbursed subsequently from the proceeds of the life insurance policies. Directors derive no financial benefit from this program since all charitable deductions accrue solely to PPG. This program is not applicable to any director initially elected on or after July 17, 2003. The aggregate cost of this program to PPG for 2018 was $59,627.
In addition to the above program, all of our current directors are eligible to participate in the PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gifts Program, which encourages charitable donations by our directors by matching his or her contributions to eligible institutions. Contributions of up to a total of $10,000 per year may be matched under the program. Most charitable organizations are eligible for the Matching Gifts Program, with a few exceptions.
Stock Ownership
We established stock ownership guidelines for all non‑employee directors effective January 1, 2005. Under the guidelines, each non‑employee director is required to own shares of our stock with a value equal to five times the portion of the annual retainer that is paid in cash. For non‑employee directors, unvested TBRSUs and common stock equivalent shares credited to the director under the Deferred Compensation Plan are counted toward meeting this requirement. Ms. Healey and Messrs. Lamach and Heminger are within their five‑year compliance period and should meet the ownership requirement by the end of such period. All other non‑employee directors have met or exceeded the ownership requirement.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
PPG's vision is to be the world's leading coatings company by consistently delivering high‑quality, innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings. This vision is enabled by a strategy of accelerated profitable growth and enhanced operational excellence. Our executive compensation program is a key factor in promoting this strategy and a crucial tool in aligning the interests of our senior leadership with those of our shareholders.
The Company's strong performance and focus on shareholder value is evident in our continuing legacy of outstanding cash generation and rewarding shareholders. PPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899 and has increased its annual dividend payout for 47 consecutive years. Continuing with that legacy, in 2018 PPG returned about $2.2 billion to shareholders in the form of an increased annual per share dividend payout and share repurchases.
Executive compensation is based on our pay‑for‑performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter‑term performance objectives and longer‑term shareholder value creation. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives' annual and long‑term compensation is performance‑based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. We believe the program strikes the appropriate balance between effectively incentivizing our executives based on performance and utilizing responsible, market competitive pay practices in order that our executives dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. This balance is evidenced by the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· In 2018, the Company delivered solid financial performance despite significant and persistent raw material and logistics cost inflation, which impacted the entire coatings industry. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2018 were approximately $15.4 billion, up about 4% compared to 2017, including net favorable foreign currency translation of less than 1%. The Company's 2018 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, or $5.40 per diluted share, versus $1.4 billion, or $5.31 per diluted share, in 2017. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2018 was $1.45 billion, versus $1.51 billion in 2017. 
· In September, the Company raised the per‑share dividend by 7%—paying approximately $450 million in dividends in 2018. The Company also repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of stock in 2018. 
· In 2018, the Company completed several acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $380 million. 
[END TABLE]
The following charts contain adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations, net sales from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations as used for determining the compensation of our executive officers for each of the last five fiscal years:
Adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for earnings‑per‑diluted share or net income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PPG's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot

A Regulation G reconciliation of adjusted earnings‑per‑share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations to reported adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations is included in Annex A to this Proxy Statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Although we had solid performance in 2018, we did not achieve our adjusted earnings per diluted share target, our adjusted cash flow target or our sales volume/mix growth target. As a result, annual incentive awards that were paid to executive officers ranged from 37% to 116% of target. Our total shareholder return over the past three years when measured against the S&P 500 was in the 31st percentile resulting in the payment of long‑term TSR share awards at 32.5% of target. 
· Between 70% and 89% of the named executive officers' target total direct compensation opportunity for 2018 was in the form of performance‑based variable compensation and long‑term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. 
· Base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the market median. 
· PPG's compensation programs are reviewed annually to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of the 2018 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long‑term value of PPG. 
· At the 2018 annual meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say‑on‑pay vote. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 93% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2018 say‑on‑pay resolution. Following its review of this vote, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee recommended to the full Board that we retain our general approach to executive compensation, with an emphasis on short‑ and long‑term incentive compensation that rewards our executive officers when they deliver value for our shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy: 
· Our performance metrics are focused on increasing shareholder value and are tied to measures impacting both shorter‑term and longer‑term performance. Shorter‑term performance metrics include adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities-continuing operations, pre‑tax, pre‑interest income, working capital reduction, and sales volume/mix growth. Longer‑term performance metrics include total shareholder return, adjusted earnings per diluted share growth, cash flow return on capital and stock price appreciation. 
· Payment of long‑term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. We have three‑year award and payout cycles for both performance‑based restricted stock units, or PBRSUs, and total shareholder return shares, or TSR shares. We also have three‑year vesting for stock options. 
· We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Our officers are subject to stock ownership requirements. Our Chief Executive Officer must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of six times his base salary and the other executive officers must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of three times his or her base salary. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election. Those officers who have not yet met this requirement are paid 20% of their annual incentive in PPG stock, which is restricted from sale for a period of two to five years. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement, except for Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018. Ms. Liebert is within the five‑year compliance period.
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as "short sales," "short sales against the box," "put" and "call" options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive's risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. 
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
· Executive officers are subject to a "clawback" policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. 
· We do not provide tax gross‑ups on perquisites to our named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
PPG's philosophy in establishing compensation policies for our executive officers is to align compensation with our strategic objectives, while concurrently providing competitive compensation that enables us to attract and retain top‑quality executive talent. The primary objectives of our compensation policies for executive officers are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Attract and retain executive officers by offering total compensation that is competitive with that offered by similarly situated companies and rewarding outstanding personal performance; 
· Promote and reward the achievement of short‑term objectives that our Board of Directors and management believe will lead to long‑term growth in shareholder value; and 
· Closely align the interests of executive officers with those of our shareholders by making long‑term incentive compensation dependent upon the Company's financial performance and total shareholder return. 
[END TABLE]
Principal Components of Executive Compensation
The principal components of our executive compensation program are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  COMPENSATION COMPONENT    OVERVIEW    OBJECTIVES  
  Base Salary    Fixed compensation that is established annually.    Maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions.  
  Annual Incentive Awards    Variable compensation that is based on Company, business, and individual performance.    Incentivize executive officers to achieve our short‑term performance objectives.  
  Long‑Term, Equity‑Based Incentives    Variable compensation that is based solely on Company performance.    Retain our executive officers, align their financial interests with the interests of shareholders, and incentivize achievement of our long‑term strategic goals.  
[END TABLE]
Mix of Compensation Components
Executive compensation is based on our pay‑for‑performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter‑term performance objectives and longer‑term shareholder value creation. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives' annual and long‑term compensation is performance‑based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. The portion of compensation that is performance‑based increases with the executive's level of responsibility. We use performance-based compensation for more senior positions because these roles have greater leadership responsibility and influence on the performance of the Company as a whole.
Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk
In 2018, the Company's management undertook a review of all of PPG's compensation programs to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of this review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long‑term value of PPG. For more information about this review and the features of our compensation program that mitigate risk, see "Corporate Governance—Compensation Program Design Mitigates Risk" on page 23.
Annual Compensation Programs
Our executive officers receive two forms of annual compensation—base salary and annual incentive awards—which together constitute an executive's total annual compensation. Please note that "total annual compensation," as discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, differs from the "Total" compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 44, which includes long‑term incentive and other forms of compensation. The levels of base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually under a program intended to

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the "market value" for that position.
To determine market value, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considers compensation data based on a comparator group, as well as the most recently available data from nationally‑recognized independent executive compensation surveys representing a cross section of manufacturing companies.
For purposes of establishing the 2018 executive compensation program, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considered a competitive analysis of total direct compensation levels and compensation mixes for our executive officers, using information from:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· two general industry surveys as provided by management: the Aon Hewitt Associates 2017 TCM Executive Total Compensation Survey and the Willis Towers Watson 2017 U.S. General Industry Executive Database. The competitive consensus for top five named executive officers consists of an equally‑weighted average of median data from both general industry surveys; and 
· comparison company median data from a comparator group consisting of 20 companies. The comparator group used in 2017 to set 2018 compensation was: 
  3M Company    Eastman Chemical Company    Honeywell International Inc.    Parker‑Hannifin Corporation  
  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.    Eaton Corporation    Illinois Tool Works Inc.    Praxair, Inc.  
  Arconic Inc.    Ecolab Inc.    International Paper Company    The Sherwin‑Williams Company  
  The Dow Chemical Company    Emerson Electric Co.    Johnson Controls, Inc.    Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.  
  E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company    Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company    Monsanto Company    Textron Inc.  
[END TABLE]
Our comparator group is intended to be representative of the market in which we compete most directly for executive talent. The selection of companies comprising our comparator group is based on similarity in revenue size, lines of business, participation in global markets and market capitalization. The peer group is constructed to target PPG near the median of the composite ranking of the financial and operating metrics of the companies in the comparator group.
The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee annually reviews this group of companies with our independent executive compensation consultant, FW Cook, to ensure that it remains an appropriate benchmark for us.
We target the median levels of compensation to derive our market value by adjusting this compensation data to reflect differences in company revenues using regression analysis. The competitive analysis showed that the 2018 target total direct compensation for the Company's named executive officers was positioned within the market median range on average.
In addition, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee annually reviews a tally sheet of each executive officer's compensation. Each tally sheet includes detailed data for each of the following compensation elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Annual compensation: Information regarding base salary and annual incentive targets for the current year; 
· Long‑term incentive awards: Information regarding all equity‑based awards, whether vested or unvested, including total pre‑tax value to the executive and holdings relative to our stock ownership requirements; 
· Benefits and perquisites: Line item summary showing the annualized cost to the Company of health and welfare benefits, life insurance and perquisites; 
· Pension and deferred compensation: Annualized cost to the Company of pension plan benefits (qualified plan and non‑qualified plan) and defined contribution plans (401(k) and deferred compensation); and 
· Description and quantification of all compensation and benefits payable upon retirement, termination of employment or change in control. 
[END TABLE]
The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee reviews the information presented in the tally sheet to ensure that it is informed of the compensation and benefits each executive is receiving annually.

Table of Contents
The charts below illustrate the allocation of the principal compensation components for our named executive officers for 2018.
Annual Compensation Policies
Our annual compensation policies reflect our pay‑for‑performance philosophy. We set target total annual compensation for our executive officers to be competitive with the market value for comparable positions, taking into account each executive's experience in the position and performance. Annual incentive awards are targeted at a level that, when combined with base salaries, is intended to yield total annual compensation that approximates market value. As a result, total annual compensation for a position generally should exceed its market value when our financial performance exceeds our applicable annual targets and individual performance contributes to meeting our objectives. Total annual compensation generally should be below market value when our financial performance does not meet targets and/or individual performance does not have a favorable impact on our objectives.
Base Salary.    Based on the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee's review of the applicable compensation data as discussed above, in February 2018 the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee set base salaries effective March 1, 2018 for all executive officers in relation to the market value for comparable positions. Mr. McGarry received a base salary increase of $40,000; Mr. Morales received a based increase of $75,000; Mr. Bost received a base salary increase of $5,000; and Mr. Knavish received a base salary increase of $20,000. 
On July 1, 2018, Mr. Knavish's annual base salary increased $105,000 to $625,000.
Ms. Liebert joined PPG in June 2018, and pursuant to her offer letter with the Company, Ms. Liebert received an annual base salary of $625,000. For a description of the material terms of Ms. Liebert's offer letter, see "Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Executive Officers" on page 51.
Annual Incentive Awards.  In February 2018, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee established annual incentive awards based primarily on target levels set for each executive officer and pre‑established, short‑term performance objectives. On an annual basis, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee establishes a target annual incentive award for each executive officer based on the executive's position and the market value of comparable positions in our comparator group. For 2018, this target, when expressed as a percentage of base salary, was as follows for each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 145%; Mr. Morales, 90%; Ms. Liebert, 70%; Mr. Bost, 85%; and Mr. Knavish, 70%. The amount of an executive's actual annual incentive award, in relation to the executive's target opportunity, is determined on the basis of achievement of short‑term performance objectives. The performance objectives for our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief

The performance objectives for our other executive officers include specific financial targets for Company performance (weighted 20%), business performance (weighted 50%) and personal performance (weighted 30%).
For many years, PPG has been committed to sustainability. Recognizing the importance of sustainability and its ability to drive innovation in our business, PPG includes sustainability goals in the performance goals of its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Performance against these goals is reviewed by the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Annual incentive compensation of PPG's executives and senior managers is partially (30 percent) based on personal goals that tie to overall corporate business goals, with the remainder based on company and business financial performance. Although PPG does not require that its executives and senior managers have personal goals linked to social or environmental performance, some executives and senior managers, by virtue of their responsibilities, may have goals related to those issues. In addition, executive business unit leaders receive sustainability scorecards for their business unit, and they are responsible for driving improvement in their business unit's sustainability metrics. Safety, waste costs, energy usage and costs, and sustainable product sales are part of these executives' annual performance review.
The potential payout of the Company performance component of the annual incentive is based on a pre‑determined schedule recommended by management and approved by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee. The schedule corresponds to various levels of potential Company financial performance measured by adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations (weighted 60%), adjusted cash flow from operating activities (weighted 20%) and sales volume/mix growth (weighted 20%), assuming the minimum adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations threshold is met. The maximum payout of this component under the schedule is 220% of target.
In assessing Company performance against objectives, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee considers actual results against the approved target objectives, considering whether significant unforeseen obstacles or favorable circumstances altered the expected difficulty of achieving the desired results and the extent to which economic assumptions underlying the performance targets materialized. The overall assessment for Company performance then determines the percentage of the target award that will be paid to each executive for the Company performance component of the annual incentive award. For 2018, as described below, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee exercised discretion in applying certain non‑operating adjustments to the actual earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations and cash flow from operating activities – continuing operations results, consistent with guidelines established previously by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee. These adjustments generally relate to legacy litigation or legacy environmental remediation, accounting rule changes and major portfolio changes, including planned restructuring initiatives.
In February 2018, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee approved a financial performance standard for the Company component of the award of $6.44 adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $1,925 million and sales volume/mix growth of 1.7%. If achieved, this standard would generate 100% of the target bonus for the Company component of the award. The approved performance standard for 2018 included a threshold adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $4.83, below which no bonus would be paid, regardless of either the adjusted cash flow from operating activities or the sales volume/mix growth performance, and a minimum cash flow from continuing operations performance of $1,198 million and a minimum sales growth/mix growth performance of 0.0% for payment on those two components. In addition, the approved performance standard for 2018 included a maximum bonus opportunity of 220% if adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $7.08, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $2,156 million and sales volume/mix growth of 2.6% were achieved.
For 2018, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee approved the actual Company performance component for incentive awards based on adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $5.82, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $1,661 million and sales volume/mix growth of 0.7%. The earnings per diluted share performance component included adjustments of $0.24 for environmental remediation charges and other costs, $0.18 for a business restructuring charge, $0.03 for legacy legal settlements, $0.03 for accelerated depreciation from restructuring actions, $0.03 for an impairment of a non-manufacturing asset, $0.02 for brand rationalization, $0.02 for transaction-related costs, offset by a $0.08 gain on the sale of non-operating assets and $0.05 for the tax benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjustments to the cash flow from operating activities performance component included adding back $99 million for cash contributions to pension plans and $95 million for restructuring cash spending.

Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $5.82, adjusted cash flow from operating activities of $1,661 million and sales volume/mix growth of 0.7% resulted in a payout of 56% of target for the Company performance component, based on the schedule discussed above. For the adjusted earnings per diluted share component, this schedule yielded a payout of 59% for the result of $5.82 per share. For the adjusted cash flow component, this schedule yielded a payout of 63% for the result of $1,661 million. For the sales volume/mix growth component, this schedule yielded a payout of 41% for the result of 0.7%. Combining these three results using the 60%, 20% and 20% weightings, respectively, yielded an overall result of 56%, which was approved by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee.
Approved 2018 Performance Components
The personal performance component of the annual incentive is based on measures of individual performance relevant to the particular individual's job responsibilities. The personal performance assessment of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is determined by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee, with input from the other non‑management members of the Board. The personal performance of each other executive officer is determined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The following factors were considered in assessing the personal performance of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 against individual objectives:
Under Mr. McGarry's leadership, the Company delivered adjusted earnings per diluted share growth despite significant and persistent raw material and logistics cost inflation, which impacted the entire coatings industry. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2018 were approximately $15.4 billion, up about 4% compared to 2017, including net favorable foreign currency translation of less than 1%. The Company's 2018 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, or $5.40 per diluted share, versus $1.4 billion, or $5.31 per diluted share, in 2017. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2018 was $1.45 billion, versus $1.51 billion in 2017. Mr. McGarry led the expansion of our coatings portfolio with the signing and completion of a number of acquisitions. Mr. McGarry was also successful in leading the Company's efforts to increase prices to recover margins. These results met expectations. 
Mr. Morales led the finance organization. In 2018, the Company generated cash from operations of about $1.5 billion, which was consistent with 2017, and completed more than $1.7 billion of share repurchases. Mr. Morales led the Company's efforts to contain its costs and return capital to shareholders. In addition, he provided guidance over the signing and completion of several acquisitions. Mr. Morales effectively led initiatives to modernize the Finance function and performed effectively as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. In 2018, the Company discovered that the Company's former Vice President and Controller directed his subordinates to improperly override the Company's internal controls during the Company's financial close process, which directions were followed and not disclosed to others in senior management. This discovery led to an Audit Committee investigation and a restatement of the Company's financial statements. Subsequent to the Audit Committee investigation, Mr. Morales has been involved in the Company's remediation efforts. These results partially met expectations.

Ms. Liebert made an effective transition to the role of Senior Vice President, Automotive Coatings after joining the Company in June 2018. She led the automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) business and the Latin America region. Sales volumes expanded in Latin America, primarily from automotive OEM coatings, industrial coatings, packaging coatings and automotive refinish coatings. Ms. Liebert also began efforts to increase prices and reorganized the automotive coatings business to be more effective. These results met expectations. 
Mr. Bost was Senior Vice President and General Counsel for the period January through July, during which time he led the legal organization's assistance of the Audit Committee's investigation into certain accounting matters and was instrumental in signing and completing a number of acquisitions. In addition, he effectively performed as a member of the Executive Committee, positively influencing the results of the Company. In August, he made a successful transition to his role as Senior Vice President, Law, Compliance and Special Projects. These results exceeded expectations.
Mr. Knavish led the industrial business and the Asia Pacific region. He also oversaw the packaging coatings businesses through June. Under Mr. Knavish's leadership, industrial coatings and packaging coatings achieved increased sales volumes aided by new product technologies. Industrial coatings sales volumes growth was the strongest in Europe due to strong end-use market demand for coil and heavy-duty equipment materials. In 2018, despite significant positive price and lower overheads, margins declined due to raw material cost inflation in both Asia and his business unit accountability. Mr. Knavish was instrumental in securing two definitive agreements for acquisitions. He provided leadership to his staff responsibilities for the global supply management organization. These results partially met expectations.
Business unit short‑term performance objectives and their assessment are specific to each particular business and are based on pre‑tax, pre‑interest earnings, working capital reduction, and sales volume/mix growth. The overall assessment of business performance determines the percent of target paid to applicable executives for the business component of the annual incentive award.
For 2018, we assessed the performance of 10 defined businesses against the criteria discussed above. Actual payouts of the business performance component ranged from 0% to 190% of target. The business performance component payouts for two of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, Ms. Liebert and Mr. Knavish, are based on the performance of each of the specific businesses and regions for which each of them is responsible.
Ms. Liebert's business performance component, for the period from her hire date in June through December, was a composite of the results of the automotive coatings business and the Latin America region. The composite performance of these businesses partially met performance objectives for pre-tax, pre-interest earnings, working capital reductions and sales volume/mix growth and resulted in a payout of 20% of target for this component.
Mr. Knavish's business performance component was a composite of the results of the industrial and packaging coatings businesses and the Asia Pacific region. The composite performance of these businesses partially met performance objectives for pre-tax, pre-interest earnings, working capital reductions and sales volume/mix growth and resulted in a payout of 40% of target for this component.
The level of achievement of corporate and personal performance objectives for 2018 for Messrs. McGarry, Morales and Bost corresponded to payouts of 63%, 37% and 78% of target, respectively. The level of achievement of business, corporate and personal performance objectives for 2018 for Ms. Liebert and Mr. Knavish corresponded to payouts of 65%, and 69% of target, respectively. Ms. Liebert's annual incentive award was prorated as she joined the Company on June 21, 2018. The annual incentive awards actually paid to each of these executives for 2018 are shown in the "Non‑Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 44. Annual incentive awards for these executive officers have ranged from 37% to 159% of target.
Annual incentive awards are payable in cash, except that any executive who does not meet the stock ownership requirements described under "PPG Stock Ownership Requirements" on page 43 receives 20% of his or her annual incentive award in the form of PPG common stock. Such stock is restricted from sale by such executive for a period of between two and five years, depending upon the level of stock ownership of the executive. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. U.S.‑based participants are entitled to defer part or all of an annual incentive award under our deferred compensation plan. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their stock ownership requirement, except for Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018. Ms. Liebert is within the five‑year compliance period. For additional information concerning our deferred compensation plan, see "Deferred Compensation Opportunities" on page 40.

Long‑Term Incentive Compensation
Our Officers-Directors Compensation Committee believes that long‑term incentive compensation is an important component of our program because it has the effect of retaining executives, aligning executives' financial interests with the interests of shareholders and incentivizing achievement of PPG's long‑term strategic goals. Payment of long‑term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. Grants are targeted at levels that approximate market value for comparable positions, utilizing the same compensation data used for setting total annual compensation. Each February, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee reviews and approves equity‑based compensation for that year to be granted to executive officers. Three types of long‑term incentive awards are granted annually to executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Stock options; 
· Total Shareholder Return contingent shares, or TSR shares; and 
· Performance‑based Restricted Stock Units, or PBRSUs. 
[END TABLE]
The number of stock options, TSR shares and PBRSUs granted to executive officers is intended to represent an estimated potential value that, when combined with total annual compensation, as discussed above, will approximate the market value of total annual and long‑term compensation paid to executives in our comparator group and in a cross‑section of general industrial companies represented in nationally‑recognized executive compensation surveys.
These types of long‑term incentive awards were selected to provide a program that focuses on different aspects of long‑term performance: stock price appreciation, total return to shareholders and earnings‑per‑share growth and cash flow return on capital. The estimated potential value of the awards granted to each executive officer is delivered equally through each instrument, so that approximately one‑third of the value of the total award is in stock options, one‑third is in performance‑based RSUs, and one‑third is in TSR shares. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee selected equal distribution to emphasize its view that each of the three equity‑based vehicles serves a particular purpose and is equally important in supporting our long‑term compensation strategy.
Stock Options.  Stock options provide our executive officers with the opportunity to purchase and maintain an equity interest in PPG and to share in the appreciation of the value of our stock. All stock options granted to executive officers in 2018 were granted from our shareholder‑approved Omnibus Incentive Plan. Some features of our stock option program include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Options become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant; 
· The term of each grant does not exceed ten years; 
· The exercise price is equal to the closing market price on the date of grant (we do not backdate or grant discounted stock options); 
· We do not grant options with "reload" or "restored" provisions; and 
· Repricing of stock options is prohibited. 
[END TABLE]
We continue to use stock options as a long‑term incentive because stock options focus the management team on delivering levels of company financial performance over a longer term that contribute to shareholder value. For additional information concerning the timing of grants of stock options, see "Our Policies with Respect to the Granting of Equity Awards" on page 42.  In February 2018, the following stock options were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 105,057; Mr. Morales, 17,072; Mr. Bost, 17,072; and Mr. Knavish, 11,819. Ms. Liebert was awarded a one-time grant of 15,272 stock options in June 2018 when she joined the Company. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long‑term incentive awards equally among three different equity‑based vehicles, as discussed above.

TSR Shares.  TSR shares represent a contingent share grant that is made at the beginning of a three‑calendar‑year performance period and vests on the last day of the performance period. The grant is settled in a combination of cash and shares of PPG common stock at the end of the performance period. The award amount generated by the grant is based on PPG's total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 comparison group. This comparison group represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that have been removed from the Index because they ceased to be publicly traded during the performance period. The calculation of total shareholder return assumes that all dividends were reinvested. Summarized below are the material provisions of the TSR share program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  BASIS OF PAYOUT    PERFORMANCE PERIOD    VESTING AND PAYOUT OF BENEFIT  
• Total shareholder return of PPG compared to total shareholder return for S&P 500 companies (as described above)• Payout is 0% to 220% of original TSR shares awarded:    3 calendar years• Vest on last day of performance period• Settled in a combination of cash and shares at end of performance period• Dividend equivalents are awarded at the end of the performance period, based on the actual number of shares earned and paid

[END TABLE]
If minimum performance is not achieved, no payment is made with respect to the TSR share grant. If performance is above target, payment may exceed the original number of contingent TSR shares awarded. Target performance is set at the 60th percentile rank, which allows for a 100% payout only if our performance is greater than the median performance for the comparison set of companies. The minimum and maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of a TSR share grant ranges from 0% to 220% of the original number of contingent TSR shares awarded. Dividend equivalents are awarded at the end of the performance period, based on the actual number of shares earned and paid to an executive. TSR shares are intended to reward executives only when we provide a greater long‑term return to shareholders relative to a percentage of the comparison set of companies, which is consistent with our pay‑for‑performance compensation philosophy.
In February 2018, the following TSR shares were awarded to each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. McGarry, 22,925; Mr. Morales, 3,725; Mr. Bost, 3,725; and Mr. Knavish, 2,579. Ms. Liebert was awarded a one-time grant of 3,172 TSR shares in June 2018 when she joined the Company. Such awards are consistent with our program to distribute long‑term incentive awards equally among three different equity‑based vehicles, as discussed above under "Long‑Term Incentive Compensation."
The performance period for the TSR shares granted in 2016 ended on December 31, 2018. PPG's total shareholder return was measured against that of the S&P 500 (as described above) over the three‑year period ending December 31, 2018. PPG's ranking on this performance measure was at the 31st percentile, resulting in payouts at 32.5% of target. The payouts were distributed 50% in shares of PPG common stock and 50% in cash. The cash payment was calculated based on the average PPG stock closing price during the month of December 2018. Payouts to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2016 TSR grants were: Mr. McGarry, 3,934 shares and $397,486; Mr. Morales, 160 shares and $16,174; Mr. Bost, 713 shares and $72,077; and Mr. Knavish, 286 shares and $28,912. Such share payouts, which vested in December 2018, are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 48.
Performance‑based RSUs.  Performance‑based RSUs, or PBRSUs, represent a contingent share grant that is made at the beginning of a three‑calendar‑year performance period and vests on the last day of the performance period. If we achieve certain pre‑determined performance thresholds, payment is settled in shares of PPG common stock in the February immediately after the end of the three‑year performance period. The performance criteria for each year in the three‑year performance period are 10% growth in adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share and 12% cash flow return on capital, taking into account the same adjustment categories utilized by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents in determining adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share for purposes of annual incentive awards (see "Annual Incentive Awards" above). If minimum performance is not achieved, no shares are issued with respect to the grant. If performance is above target, the number of shares issued may exceed the original number of contingent shares awarded. The minimum and maximum number of shares that may be issued upon settlement of an PBRSU ranges from 0% to 180% of the original number of contingent shares awarded, depending on the number of goals attained during the three‑year period (see the table below for a breakdown of the payout percentages). No dividend equivalents are awarded on performance‑based RSUs. By including performance‑based RSUs in the long‑term incentive mix, executives are rewarded when financial performance objectives are achieved over an extended period of time. Summarized below are the material provisions of the performance‑based RSUs:

The Company made share payouts to the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2016 PBRSU grants as follows: Mr. McGarry, 25,338; Mr. Morales, 980; Mr. Bost, 4,595; and Mr. Knavish, 1,755. Such payouts, which vested in December 2018, are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 48.
In February 2019, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee determined to change the cash flow return on capital performance goal for the PBRSUs from 12% to 11% beginning with the 2019 performance goal. This change was made as a result of the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, "Leases," effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard will require the Company to recognize the value of its right to use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet as the rights and obligations created by lease arrangements with terms greater than 12 months. These lease obligations will be classified as debt which will increase the Company's reported total debt and will have the effect of reducing the Company's cash flow return on capital. The Company is nearly complete in assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects an impact on assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet in the range of $700 million to $750 million.

Time-based RSUs.  In connection with her hiring in June 2018, Ms. Liebert was awarded a one-time grant of 29,923 time-based RSUs, which vest 10,228 on December 31, 2019; 14,271 on December 31, 2020; 3,996 on December 31, 2022; and 1,428 on December 31, 2023.
Perquisites and Other Benefits
In addition to the annual and long‑term compensation described above, executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table receive certain perquisites and other benefits. Such perquisites may include financial counseling services and limited personal use of PPG's corporate aircraft. At the direction of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee, in 2011 executive officer perquisites were reviewed and reduced. Effective January 1, 2012, personal club memberships were discontinued and financial counseling benefits were limited to current participants only. Other benefits for our executive officers may include Company matching contributions under our Deferred Compensation Plan. These perquisites and other benefits are provided to increase the availability of the executives to focus on the business of the enterprise or because we believe they are important to our ability to attract and retain top‑quality executive talent. The costs to PPG associated with providing these benefits for executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table are reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 44 and in the All Other Compensation Table on page 45.
We also provide other benefits, such as medical, dental and life insurance and disability coverage, to each executive named in the Summary Compensation Table under our benefit plans, which are also provided to most eligible U.S.‑based salaried employees. In addition, all of our U.S.‑based executive officers are eligible to participate in the PPG Industries Foundation Matching Gift Program, which encourages charitable donations by all of our U.S. employees by matching his or her contributions to eligible institutions. Contributions of up to a total of $10,000 per year may be matched under the program. Most charitable organizations are eligible for the Matching Gifts Program, with a few exceptions. The value of these benefits is not included in the Summary Compensation Table because such benefits are made available on a Company‑wide basis to most U.S. salaried employees. We also provide vacation and other paid holidays to all employees, including the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, which are comparable to those provided at other large companies.
Deferred Compensation Opportunities
Another aspect of our executive compensation program is our Deferred Compensation Plan. The plan is a voluntary, non‑tax qualified, unfunded, deferred compensation plan available to all U.S.‑based executive officers and other participants in our management incentive plans to enable them to save for retirement by deferring a portion of their current compensation. The plan also provides eligible employees with supplemental contributions equal to the contributions they would have received under our Employee Savings Plan, but for certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, compensation may be deferred until death, disability, retirement or termination or, in the case of the cash portion of certain incentive awards, other earlier specified dates the participants may select. Deferred amounts (other than the PPG common stock portion of deferred incentive awards, which must be invested in PPG stock) are credited to an investment account that earns a return based on the investment options chosen by the participant. The value of a participant's investment account is based on the value of the investments selected. Benefits are paid out of our general assets. For additional information concerning our Deferred Compensation Plan, see "Defined Contribution Retirement Plans and Deferred Compensation Plan" and the accompanying Non‑Qualified Deferred Compensation Table on page 51.
Retirement Plans
For certain longer‑serving, U.S.‑based, salaried employees, we maintain both a tax‑qualified defined benefit pension plan, called Retirement Plan C, and a non‑qualified defined benefit pension plan, called the Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan. U.S.‑based salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are not eligible to participate in these plans. Each of the U.S.‑based executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table participate in these plans, except Ms. Liebert. The compensation covered by Retirement Plan C, which is compulsory and noncontributory, is the base salary of a participant as limited by applicable Internal Revenue Service regulations. Our Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan is an unfunded supplemental plan that provides benefits paid out of our general assets in an amount substantially equal to the difference between the amount that would have been payable under Retirement Plan C, in the absence of legislation limiting pension benefits and earnings that may be considered in calculating pension benefits, and the amount actually payable under Retirement Plan C. The Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan also includes a benefit based on bonus awards for certain U.S. management bonus program participants. We believe this supplemental retirement benefit is competitive with that provided by other companies with which we compete for executive talent. For additional

Table of Contents information concerning our retirement plans, see "Pension Benefits" and "Defined Contribution Retirement Plans and Deferred Compensation Plan" on pages 48 through 51.
Through December 31, 2015, we maintained a tax‑qualified defined contribution retirement plan, called the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan, which was established by PPG for certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plan was funded by contributions made by the Company. Contributions were between 2% and 5% of a participant's eligible plan compensation, based on age and years of service. If contributions made for the benefit of an executive were limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we credited such excess contributions to the executive officer's account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. An executive had a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing three years of service with the Company and when the employee was within ten years of his or her Social Security normal retirement age or upon termination of employment after reaching early retirement age. On January 1, 2016, the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan was terminated and all balances were transferred to the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. Former participants in the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan now receive the same contributions they would have received under the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan as additional Company contributions to the Employee Savings Plan.
The PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan covers substantially all employees in the U.S. The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plan, at management's discretion, based upon participants' savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, Company‑matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant savings up to a maximum of 6% of eligible participant compensation. Employees can contribute from 1% to 50% of eligible plan compensation to the Savings Plan, subject to certain Plan or legal limits that may apply. Employees are always 100% vested in any money employees contribute or the Company contributes to the Savings Plan as a matching contribution. All of our executive officers participate in the Savings Plan. Executive officers and other employees who were participants in the former Defined Contribution Retirement Plan now receive the same contributions they would have received under the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan as an additional Company contribution to the Employee Savings Plan. These contributions vest upon completion of three years of service with the Company.
Change In Control Agreements
We have agreements in place with each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table providing for their continued employment for a period of up to three years in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of PPG (as "change in control" is defined in the agreements). We believe that these agreements serve to maintain the focus of our senior executives and ensure that their attention, efforts and commitment are aligned with maximizing the success of PPG and shareholder value. These agreements avoid distractions involving executive management that arise when the Board is considering possible strategic transactions involving a change in control and assure continuity of executive management and objective input to the Board when it is considering any strategic transaction. For additional information concerning our change in control agreements, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on pages 52 through 57.
Regulatory Considerations
The tax and accounting consequences of utilizing various forms of compensation are considered when adopting new or modifying existing compensation programs. For example, we considered limitations on the deductibility of personal use of corporate aircraft under the American Jobs Creation Act when adopting our policies regarding use of our aircraft by executive officers. In addition, we have administered our incentive and equity compensation programs, severance plans and change in control agreements in compliance with federal tax rules affecting non‑qualified deferred compensation.
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any one named executive officer during any fiscal year. Under the rules in effect before 2018, compensation that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m) was deductible without regard to this $1 million limit. To maintain flexibility in compensating executives in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee did not adopt a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible under Section 162(m) and continues to reserve the right to structure compensation arrangements and issue awards that may not be deductible under Section 162(m). However, the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee historically has considered, among other factors, deductibility under Section 162(m) with respect to compensation arrangements for executives. Prior to 2018, we generally designed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs for executives in a manner that was intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), with the understanding that these programs may not qualify from time to time.

Table of Contents
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m), effective January 1, 2018, subject to a special rule that "grandfathers" certain awards and arrangements that were in effect on or before November 2, 2017. As a result, compensation that our Officers-Directors Compensation Committee structured in 2017 and prior years with the intent of qualifying as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) that is paid on or after January 1, 2018 may not be fully deductible, depending on the application of the special grandfather rules. Moreover, from and after January 1, 2018, compensation awarded in excess of $1,000,000 to our named executive officers, including our chief financial officer, generally will not be deductible. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, our Officers-Directors Compensation Committee will, consistent with its past practice,  continue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long-term interests of PPG and our shareholders, with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations taken into account. We continue to analyze whether to redesign any of our compensation programs in light of the amendments to Section 162(m) and other sections of the Internal Revenue Code that became effective in 2018.
Financial Restatement
It is our policy that we will, to the extent permitted by governing law, seek recoupment of incentive compensation paid to any executive officer where:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement; 
· the executive officer is found to have engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement; and 
· a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results. 
[END TABLE]
In each such instance, we will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover the amount by which the individual executive officer's incentive compensation for the relevant period exceeded the payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest.
Our Policies with Respect to the Granting of Equity Awards
Equity awards may be granted by either the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee or its delegate. The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee only delegates authority to grant equity awards to employees who are not executive officers, and only in aggregate amounts not exceeding amounts approved by the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee. The Board generally does not grant equity awards, although the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee regularly reports its activity, including approval of grants, to the Board.
Timing of Grants.  Equity awards are granted in February at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee, and generally further grants are not made for the remainder of the year. These meetings occur approximately one month after the release of our earnings for the immediately preceding year. On limited occasions, grants may occur on an interim basis, primarily for the purpose of approving a compensation package for a newly hired or promoted executive officer. The timing of these grants is driven solely by the activity related to the need for the hiring or promotion, not our stock price or the timing of any release of Company information.
Option Exercise Price.  The exercise price of a newly granted stock option is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. With respect to the occasional interim grants to a newly hired or promoted executive, the exercise price is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, which is the later of the approval date or the hire or promotion date; provided, however, that if the date of hire or promotion would fall within a Company imposed blackout period, the grant date will be the first business day following such blackout period.

PPG Stock Ownership Requirements
The Officers-Directors Compensation Committee also believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders for our officers to own a significant amount of PPG common stock, thereby aligning their interests with the interests of shareholders. Accordingly, in 2003 the Officers-Directors Compensation Committee implemented stock ownership requirements applicable to all of our officers based on a multiple of base salary. The current stock ownership requirements are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Chief Executive Officer    6 times base salary  
  Other executive officers    3 times base salary  
  Other officers    1 or 2 times base salary  
[END TABLE]
Ownership for purposes of these requirements includes shares of PPG common stock personally owned as well as all stock holdings in PPG's savings plan and deferred compensation accounts. Unexercised options and unvested shares awarded under our long‑term incentive plans are not counted for these purposes. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election, appointment or promotion. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement, except for Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018. Ms. Liebert is within the five‑year compliance period.
Securities Trading Policy
PPG officers and directors may not engage in any transaction in which they may profit from short‑term speculative swings in the value of PPG's securities. This prohibition includes "short sales" (selling borrowed securities that the seller hopes can be purchased at a lower price in the future) or "short sales against the box" (selling owned, but not delivered securities), "put" and "call" options (publicly available rights to sell or buy securities within a certain period of time at a specified price) and other hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive's risk inherent in owning PPG stock, such as zero‑cost collars and forward sale contracts. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. This policy is designed to ensure compliance with all insider trading rules.

    (4)      The named executive officers were not entitled to receive any payments that would be characterized as "Bonus" payments for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Amounts listed under the column "Non‑Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" constitute annual incentive awards for 2017, 2016 and 2015 that were determined by the Officers‑Directors Compensation Committee at its February 20, 2019, February 14, 2018 and February 15, 2017 meetings, respectively, and, to the extent not deferred by an executive, were paid out shortly thereafter. 
    (5)      The amounts in this column represent the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for grants occurring in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 of performance‑based restricted stock units, or PBRSUs, and performance‑based total shareholder return contingent shares, or TSRs, granted as part of the long‑term incentive components of our compensation program described on page 38. The assumptions used in calculating these amounts for 2018 are set forth in Note 18 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is located on pages 86 through 88 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K. PBRSUs and TSRs are subject to performance conditions, and the grant date fair value shown is based on performance at target levels, which is the probable outcome of such conditions. The value of these awards made in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, assuming that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved, is as follows: Mr. McGarry, $10,669,646; Mr. Morales, $1,733,675; Ms. Liebert, $4,262,196; Mr. Bost, $1,733,675; and Mr. Knavish, $1,200,307. The value of these awards made in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, assuming that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved, is as follows: Mr. McGarry $10,000,058; Mr. Morales, $1,039,196; Mr. Bost, $1,733,347; and Mr. Knavish, $933,436.

Pension Benefits
For certain longer‑serving, U.S.‑based, salaried employees we maintain both a tax‑qualified defined benefit pension plan, called Retirement Plan C, and a non‑qualified defined benefit pension plan, called the Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are not eligible to participate in these plans. Each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table participates in these plans, with the exception of Ms. Liebert. The table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to each such named executive officer as of December 31, 2018, including the number of years of service credited to each such named executive officer, under each of Retirement Plan C and the Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in our financial statements. The material terms of Retirement Plan C and the Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan are described below.

As further described in the narrative discussion following this table, in connection with his transition to Senior Vice President, Law, Compliance and Special Projects, Mr. Bost's non-qualified pension benefit was frozen under the Company's non-qualified defined benefit pension plan effective August 1, 2018. As further described in the narrative discussion following this table, the estimated lump‑sum present value under the Non‑Qualified Pension Plan to which the officer would be entitled is as follows: Mr. McGarry, $20,217,638 and Mr. Bost, $7,384,682.

Table of Contents
The values reflected in the "Present Value of Accumulated Benefit" column of the Pension Benefits Table are equal to the actuarial present value of each officer's accrued benefit under the applicable plan as of December 31, 2018, using the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes, except that retirement age is assumed to be normal retirement age as defined in the applicable plan. These assumptions are described under Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is located on pages 72 through 81 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K. In accordance with Item 402(h) of Regulation S‑K, the present value amounts are calculated using a 4.42% discount rate for Retirement Plan C and 4.33% discount rate for the Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan. The lump‑sum payment amounts for the Non‑Qualified Pension Plan are calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Non‑Qualified Pension Plan using the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation discount rate of 1.50% as in effect on December 31, 2018, rather than the 4.33% discount rate used for financial statement reporting purposes. In connection with his transition to Senior Vice President, Law, Compliance and Special Projects, Mr. Bost's benefit under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan was frozen effective August 1, 2018. Subsequent to August 1, 2018, Mr. Bost will no longer accrue any benefits under the Non-Qualified Pension Plan due to service or pay. From August 1, 2018 through Mr. Bost's retirement, his frozen benefit will earn interest at 120% of the August 2018 long-term Applicable Federal Rate, as determined by the Internal Revenue Service.
The benefit payable under Retirement Plan C is a function of the participant's five‑year average annual covered base compensation for the highest five consecutive years out of the final ten years immediately prior to retirement and credited years of service. In January 2011, Retirement Plan C was amended such that eligible employees with combined age and service points fewer than 60 and actively employed by the Company as of December 31, 2011 ceased to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C as of December 31, 2011. Eligible employees with combined age and service points of 60 or more and actively employed by the Company at December 31, 2011 will continue to accrue benefits under Retirement Plan C until the earlier of their retirement date or December 31, 2020. When benefits cease to accrue under Retirement Plan C, eligible employees will earn future retirement benefits through the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. The Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan's benefit is supplemental to the qualified plan's benefit in that the Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan provides a benefit that is substantially equal to the difference between the amount that would have been payable under the qualified Retirement Plan C, in the absence of legislation limiting the compensation covered by the plan, and the amount actually payable under Retirement Plan C. The Non‑Qualified Retirement Plan also includes a benefit based on bonus awards for certain U.S. management bonus program participants. The benefit payable under the Non‑Qualified Plan is determined in the same manner as for Retirement Plan C with regard to credited service and base salary above legislative limits; incentive payments are factored in by using the average of the highest five payments during the last ten years prior to retirement.
Retirement Plan C contains the following material terms:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The normal form of benefit is a life annuity for unmarried participants and a joint and 50% survivor annuity for married participants; 
· A participant may elect out of the normal form of benefit and receive an actuarially‑equivalent alternative form of benefit, including a single life annuity (for a married participant) or a joint and survivor annuity with a survivor benefit ranging from 1%‑100%, as selected by the participant; 
· There is no lump‑sum benefit option; 
· A participant may elect early retirement up to ten years prior to the participant's normal retirement age, subject to reduction of the retirement benefit to reflect the early commencement of the benefit; and 
· A participant has a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing five years of service or reaching early retirement age. 
[END TABLE]
The Non‑Qualified Plan contains the following material terms:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A participant is entitled to a distribution upon reaching the later of his or her early retirement date (as defined in the qualified plan) or the participant's termination of employment; 
· The normal form of payment for benefits at retirement for the group of participants that includes each of the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table who participates in the plan is a lump‑sum payment; and 
· A participant has a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing five years of service or reaching early retirement age, but his or her accrued benefit is subject to forfeiture if the participant engages in any competitive activity, or other activity that is deemed contrary or harmful to the interests of PPG.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans and Deferred Compensation Plan
Through December 31, 2015, we maintained a tax‑qualified defined contribution retirement plan, called the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan, which was established by PPG for certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plan was funded by contributions made by the Company. Contributions were between 2% and 5% of a participant's eligible plan compensation, based on age and years of service. If contributions made for the benefit of an executive were limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we credited such excess contributions to the executive officer's account in the Deferred Compensation Plan. An executive had a fully vested benefit under the plan upon completing three years of service with the Company, and when the employee was within ten years of his or her Social Security normal retirement age or upon termination of employment after reaching early retirement age. On January 1, 2016, the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan was terminated and all balances were transferred to the PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan. Former participants in the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan now receive the same contributions they would have received under the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan as additional Company contributions to the Employee Savings Plan.
The PPG Industries Employee Savings Plan covers substantially all employees in the U.S. The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plan, at management's discretion, based upon participants' savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, Company‑matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant savings up to a maximum of 6% of eligible participant compensation. Employees can contribute from 1% to 50% of eligible plan compensation to the Savings Plan, subject to certain Plan or legal limits that may apply. Employees are always 100% vested in any money employees contribute or the Company contributes to the Savings Plan as a matching contribution. All of our executive officers participate in the Savings Plan. Executive officers and other employees who were participants in the former Defined Contribution Retirement Plan now receive the same contributions they would have received under the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan as an additional Company contribution to the Employee Savings Plan. These contributions vest upon completion of three years of service with the Company.
In the U.S., we maintain the Deferred Compensation Plan to allow participants, including each of the U.S.‑based executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, to defer a portion of their compensation in a phantom PPG stock account or other phantom investment accounts. The amount deferred earns a return based on the investment options selected by the executive officer. Executive officers may elect to defer up to 50% of their base salary, and up to 100% of any incentive award, TSR share award and restricted stock unit award that the executive officer may be entitled to receive. All dividend equivalents earned on TSR share award grants are deferred into the Deferred Compensation Plan. We also may make certain additional contributions to the executive officer's account. For example, if the executive officer's contributions under the Employee Savings Plan are limited due to requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we will credit such excess contributions to the executive officer's account under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The executive officer is always fully vested in compensation that he or she elects to have deferred into the plan and any contributions made on behalf of the executive officer related to the Employee Savings Plan. Company contributions are invested proportionally into the investment options chosen by the employee.
The table below shows the Deferred Compensation Plan's current investment options and their respective annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2018, as reported by the administrator of the plan.

The amount owed to executive officers under the Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation of PPG. An executive officer receives a distribution of the balance in his or her plan account upon retirement, death, disability, termination of employment, a scheduled payment date, financial hardship (for amounts deferred prior to January 1, 2005) or unforeseeable emergency (for amounts deferred after December 31, 2004). Distributions can be in the form of a lump sum or installments. Payment can commence at the time of separation or, in certain situations, can be deferred until a later point in time. Compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2005 and related earnings are distributed according to the executive officer's election. Compensation deferred after December 31, 2004 and related earnings are distributed according to the executive officer's election only in the case of retirement (no earlier than six months following retirement). In the case of disability or termination, the distribution is made in a lump sum on the date that is the later of (i) the first day of the first quarter of a plan year that is six months and ten days following the

In the case of death, a distribution is made to the executive officer's beneficiary as soon as administratively possible.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The tables below reflect the amount of compensation to each of our currently serving executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the event of termination of such executive's employment under certain circumstances. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, and thus includes amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from PPG.
For purposes of calculating the estimated potential payments to our officers under the Non‑Qualified Pension Plan, as reflected in the tables below, we have used the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes and set forth under Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is located on pages 72 through 81 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K. However, the amounts reflected in the tables below for the Non‑Qualified Pension Plan are calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Non‑Qualified Pension Plan using the 4.33% discount rate for our U.S. non‑qualified defined benefit pension plan that is used for financial statement reporting purposes.
Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination
The first column of each table below sets forth the payments to which the officer would be entitled, other than accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad‑based employee benefit plans and programs, in the event of a termination of the officer's employment for any reason by PPG or the officer, and assuming such termination occurred prior to, or did not otherwise arise in connection with, a change in control of PPG. The second column of each table reflects payments that would be due in the event of the officer's termination of employment due to death prior to a change in control of PPG. In any of these events, we are not obligated to provide other health or welfare benefits or any special severance payments, accelerated vesting of equity compensation or tax gross‑ups to the officers. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are not eligible to participate in the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. Effective January 1, 2012, financial counseling benefits were limited to current participants only.

Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination Following, or in Connection with, a Change in Control of PPG
We have entered into change in control agreements with our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table and with certain other officers. The change in control agreements have three‑year terms, which terms are automatically extended for one year upon each anniversary unless a notice not to extend is given by PPG. If a "change in control" occurs during the term of an agreement, then the agreement becomes operative for a fixed three‑year period. The agreements provide generally that the officer's terms and conditions of employment (including position, location, compensation and benefits) will not be adversely changed during the three‑year period after a change in control of PPG. The change in control agreements also contain confidentiality provisions prohibiting the officer from divulging or communicating, without our prior consent or except as required by law, any confidential information, knowledge or data relating to PPG or its business during the officer's employment and at all times thereafter. In 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2013, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee approved certain changes to our change in control agreements, which are described under "Changes to Form of Change in Control Agreement" on pages 54 through 55.
Termination For Cause or Other Than For Good Reason.  Under the change in control agreements, in the event of an officer's termination of employment by PPG for cause or by the officer other than for good reason during the three‑year period following a change in control, the officer will receive payment only of his or her accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad‑based employee benefit plans and programs.
Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason.  If PPG terminates the officer's employment (other than for cause, death or disability) or the officer terminates his or her employment for good reason during the three‑year period following a change in control, and upon certain terminations prior to a change in control or in connection with or in anticipation of a change in control, the officer is generally entitled to receive the following payments and benefits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a pro‑rata bonus for the year of the date of termination based on the officer's highest annual bonus during the three years prior to the change in control or the annual bonus for the most recent fiscal year after the change in control, whichever is higher (such higher amount referred to herein as the "highest annual bonus"); 
· three times the officer's annual base salary; 
· three times the officer's highest annual bonus; 
· a lump‑sum payment having an actuarial present value equal to the additional pension benefits the officer would have received if he or she had continued to be employed by PPG for an additional three years for purposes of both age and service credit, assuming the officer's compensation for each such additional year is equal to his or her annual base salary prior to the change in control (or any higher salary thereafter) and his or her annual bonus is at least equal to the officer's highest annual bonus during the three years prior to the change in control (the "Pension Differential"); 
· a lump‑sum payment equal to the present value of any employer contributions the executive would have received or accrued under PPG's defined contribution retirement plans and arrangements (whether qualified or non‑qualified) in which the executive participates if the executive's employment continued for an additional three years in respect of retirement benefits provided in the form of a defined contribution retirement plan, program or arrangement, but excluding any salary or pay deferral contributions to such plans or arrangements that are deemed to be employer contributions under applicable law; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     						         2019 Proxy Statement    53  
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
· continued medical, dental and life insurance benefits for three years and continued age and service credit for purposes of determining the officer's eligibility for retiree medical benefits; 
· continued payment of financial counseling expenses for the officer for three years; and 
· a payment in an amount sufficient to make the officer whole for any excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
[END TABLE]
The table below sets forth the amounts each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table would be entitled to receive, other than accrued but unpaid base salary and any benefits payable or provided under broad‑based employee benefit plans and programs, in the event of a termination of the executive officer's employment by PPG without cause or by the executive officer for good reason following or in connection with a change in control of PPG.
For purposes of calculating the estimated potential payment to such executive officers with respect to the Pension Differential under the change in control agreements, as reflected in the table below, we have used the same actuarial factors and assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes and set forth under Note 13 to our Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is located on pages 72 through 81 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K, including a discount rate of 4.42% for Retirement Plan C and 4.33% for our U.S. non‑qualified defined benefit pension plan and assuming a lump‑sum payment of the Pension Differential.
Termination During the 30‑Day Window Period.  Under certain of our change in control agreements, if an officer terminates his or her employment for any reason during a 30‑day window period following the first anniversary of the change in control, the officer will be entitled to the payments and benefits described above, except that the multiplier of three referenced above would be two for purposes of all payments and benefits for which the multiplier is relevant.
Definitions.  For purposes of the agreements, the terms set forth below generally have the meanings described below.
"Change in Control" generally includes the occurrence of any of the following events or circumstances:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (i)      the acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of PPG or the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of PPG, other than any acquisition from or by PPG or any PPG‑sponsored employee benefit plan; 
    (ii)      a change in our Board's composition such that a majority of the Board's members does not include those who were members at the date of the agreement or members whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of directors who were on the Board at the date of the agreement; 
    (iii)      shareholder approval of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of PPG, unless following such transaction PPG's historic shareholders retain at least 60% ownership of the surviving entity, no shareholder acquires a 20% or more ownership interest in the surviving entity and a majority of the surviving entity's board of directors were members of our Board at the time such transaction was approved; 
    (iv)      shareholder approval of a dissolution or liquidation of PPG; or 
    (v)      a determination by a majority of our Board that a change in control has occurred. 
[END TABLE]
"Cause" generally means (i) the willful and continued failure of the officer to perform his or her duties; or (ii) the willful engaging by the officer in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to PPG.
"Good reason" generally means (i) the assignment of duties inconsistent with the officer's position, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect at the time of the change in control, or any other action resulting in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, other than isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith that is remedied promptly; (ii) failure to provide the employment compensation and benefits required under the change in control agreement, other than an isolated and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith that is remedied promptly; or (iii) a relocation or substantial change in the officer's workplace or the company's requiring the officer to travel on company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the change in control.
Changes to Form of Change in Control Agreement.  The Officers—Directors Compensation Committee has made modifications to the form of change in control agreement for officers in response to current trends in executive compensation and to a shareholder proposal that was supported by shareholders at the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders. PPG began entering into the revised agreements in 2008 with certain newly hired or promoted officers.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  54    2019 Proxy Statement           						   
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Key revisions to the change in control agreement in 2007 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Modification of the definition of "change in control" to require "consummation" of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of the assets of PPG. 
· Modification of the definition of "compensation" to include "target" bonus instead of the "highest" bonus over the last three years. This change affects the cash payment and the Pension Differential calculation. 
· Modification of certain termination provisions, including elimination of the window period termination. 
· Modification of the excise tax and gross‑up provision to replace the full gross up with a "conditional" gross up, which provides for a reduction in change in control payments if such payments trigger an excise tax by a limited amount. 
· Elimination of the provisions providing for the payment of financial counseling and legal expenses. 
[END TABLE]
In 2010, 2012 and 2013, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee made additional modifications to the form of change in control agreement for officers in response to current trends in executive compensation. The key revisions to the change in control agreement for 2010 were to eliminate the excise tax gross‑up entirely and include a "conditional" payment limitation, which provides for a reduction in change of control payments if such payments would trigger an excise tax, unless a larger amount would be received on an after‑tax basis without a payment reduction. The key revisions made in 2012 were to change the definition of Retirement and the associated benefits related to retirement to ensure that all applicable provisions are applied properly for executives who only participated in the former PPG Defined Contribution Retirement Plan and non‑U.S. executives who do not participate in either Retirement Plan C or the former Defined Contribution Retirement Plan. The key revision made in 2013 was to eliminate potential double payments under other PPG severance provisions or statutory requirements and the change in control agreement.

Equity Acceleration
In the event of a change in control of PPG, the Company stock plans and award agreements entered into prior to 2009 provide that the participant will be entitled to full vesting acceleration of his or her unvested stock options, TSR awards and restricted stock units. For award agreements entered into in 2009 and thereafter, in the event of a change in control of PPG, an executive must be terminated (or have a substantial diminution of job duties) to be entitled to full vesting acceleration of unvested stock options, TSR awards and restricted stock units. The table below reflects the calculation of the aggregate dollar values related to acceleration of vesting of the incentive equity awards held by the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the event of a termination following a change in control, and the total is reflected in the "Accelerated Vesting of LTI" row for each officer in the table above on page 56. The stock option value was calculated by multiplying the number of unvested shares by the difference between the grant price and the closing stock price on December 31, 2018 ($102.23). If any stock options were underwater as of December 31, 2018, no value was assigned to such options. The TSR share and restricted stock unit value was calculated by multiplying the target number of unvested shares by the closing stock price on December 31, 2018, except as otherwise noted.

PAY RATIO
Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 requires most companies with publicly traded stock in the United States to identify the median total compensation of their worldwide employee population (other than the chief executive officer) and to compare that amount with the total compensation of their chief executive officer. Total compensation amounts are required to be calculated using the SEC's compensation disclosure rules applicable to reporting compensation in the Summary Compensation Table of the Proxy Statement. Median employee compensation used to calculate the pay ratio is required to be the total compensation paid to an actual employee of the company. We identified our median employee using our total employee population as of October 1, 2018 by applying a consistently applied compensation measure across our global employee population. For our consistently applied compensation measure, we used annual base salary. We used an annual base salary as our consistently applied compensation measure as it represents the primary compensation component paid to all of our employees. As a result, annual base salary provides an accurate depiction of total earnings for the purpose of identifying our median employee. We then calculated the median employee's total annual compensation in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. We did not use any material estimates, assumptions, adjustments or statistical sampling to determine the worldwide median employee. 
Our median employee's 2018 compensation was $39,494. Our Chief Executive Officer's total 2018 compensation was $11,784,404 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 44. Accordingly, our 2018 CEO to Median Employee Pay Ratio was 298:1. Each individual's total annual compensation can be comprised of different compensation elements and is dependent on where the individual works globally.
Please keep in mind that under the SEC's rules and guidance, there are numerous ways to determine the compensation of a company's median employee, including the employee population sampled, the elements of pay and benefits used, any assumptions made and the use of statistical sampling. In addition, no two companies have identical employee populations or compensation programs, and pay, benefits and retirement plans differ by country even within the same company. As such, our pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.

PROPOSAL 3:  Advisory Vote on Approval of the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers
Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we include in this Proxy Statement a non‑binding, advisory shareholder vote on our executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement (commonly referred to as "say‑on‑pay"). Based upon the vote of our shareholders at the 2011 and 2017 annual meetings and the Board's recommendation, PPG has provided this advisory vote on an annual basis. 
We encourage shareholders to review the section of this Proxy Statement relating to executive compensation on pages 28 through 57. Executive compensation is based on our pay‑for‑performance philosophy, which emphasizes executive performance measures that correlate closely with the achievement of both shorter‑term performance objectives and longer‑term shareholder value. To this end, a substantial portion of our executives' annual and long‑term compensation is performance‑based, with the payment being contingent on the achievement of performance goals. We believe our program strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders. This balance is evidenced by the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· In 2018, the Company delivered solid financial performance despite significant and persistent raw material and logistics cost inflation, which impacted the entire coatings industry. Total net sales from continuing operations for 2018 were approximately $15.4 billion, up about 4% compared to 2017, including net favorable foreign currency translation of less than 1%. The Company's 2018 full-year reported net income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, or $5.40 per diluted share, versus $1.4 billion, or $5.31 per diluted share, in 2017. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for 2018 was $1.45 billion, versus $1.51 billion in 2017. 
· In September, the Company raised the per‑share dividend by 7%—paying approximately $450 million in dividends in 2018. The Company also repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of stock in 2018. 
· In 2018, the Company completed several acquisitions, increasing both geographic and product scope. Cash spending for these acquisitions totaled approximately $380 million. 
[END TABLE]
The following charts contain adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations, net sales from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations as used for determining the compensation of our executive officers for each of the last five fiscal years:
Adjusted earnings-per-diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for earnings‑per‑diluted share or net income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PPG's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. A Regulation G reconciliation of adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations to reported earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations is included in Annex A to this Proxy Statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Although we had strong performance in 2018, we did not achieve our adjusted earnings-per-diluted share target or our sales volume/mix growth target. As a result, annual incentive awards were paid to executive officers ranged from  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     						         2019 Proxy Statement    59  
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
37% to 116% of target. Our total shareholder return over the past three years when measured against the S&P 500 was in the 31st percentile resulting in the payment of long‑term TSR share awards at 32.5% of target. 
· Between 70% and 89% of the named executive officers' target total direct compensation opportunity for 2018 was in the form of performance‑based variable compensation and long‑term incentives motivating them to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. 
· Base salary and annual incentive targets for our executive officers are established annually to maintain parity with the competitive market for executives in comparable positions. Target total annual compensation for each position is set at or near the market median. 
· PPG's compensation programs are reviewed annually to identify any inherent material risks to PPG created by these programs. Based on the results of the 2018 review, we concluded that the design of our compensation programs does not encourage our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could harm the long‑term value of PPG. 
· At the 2018 annual meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say‑on‑pay vote. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 93% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2018 say‑on‑pay resolution. Following its review of this vote, the Officers—Directors Compensation Committee recommended to the full Board that we retain our general approach to executive compensation, with an emphasis on short‑ and long‑term incentive compensation that rewards our executive officers when they deliver value for our shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy: 
· Our performance metrics are focused on increasing shareholder value and are tied to measures impacting both shorter‑term and longer‑term performance. Shorter‑term performance metrics include adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share from continuing operations, cash flow from operating activities–continuing operations, pre‑tax, pre‑interest income, working capital reduction, and sales volume/mix growth. Longer‑term performance metrics include total shareholder return, adjusted earnings‑per‑diluted share growth, cash flow return on capital and stock price appreciation. 
· Payment of long‑term incentive awards is based solely on Company performance. We have three‑year award and payout cycles for both performance‑based restricted stock units, or PBRSUs, and total shareholder return shares, or TSR shares. We also have three‑year vesting for stock options. 
· We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. 
· Our officers are subject to stock ownership requirements. Our Chief Executive Officer must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of six times his base salary, and the other executive officers must own shares of PPG common stock with a value of three times his or her base salary. Officers are expected to meet these ownership requirements within five years of election. Those officers who have not yet met this requirement are paid 20% of their annual incentive in PPG stock, which is restricted from sale for a period of two to five years. In addition, for officers who have been subject to the policy for more than five years at their current requirement level and have not met the ownership requirement, 100% of the vested shares delivered from the PBRSU award and TSR share award must be held by the officer for a minimum of one year and until the requirement is met. The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table have met their ownership requirement, except for Ms. Liebert who joined the Company in June 2018. Ms. Liebert is within the five‑year compliance period. 
· Our officers may not engage in transactions that are contrary to the interests of shareholders, such as "short sales," "short sales against the box," "put" and "call" options and hedging transactions designed to minimize an executive's risk inherent in owning PPG stock. In addition, officers may not hold PPG stock in a margin account and may not pledge PPG stock as collateral for a loan. 
· Executive officers are subject to a "clawback" policy that is designed to recoup incentive compensation when a financial restatement occurs and certain other conditions exist. 
· We do not provide tax gross‑ups on perquisites to our named executive officers.

PROPOSAL 4:  Proposal to Amend the Articles of Incorporation to Provide for the Annual Election of Directors
PPG's Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to PPG's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to provide for the phased-in elimination of the classified board of directors structure and the annual election of directors. At PPG's 2012, 2013 and 2018 annual meetings of shareholders, PPG presented the same proposal for approval by the Company's shareholders. In 2012, 2013 and 2018, the proposal received the affirmative vote of approximately 99% of the votes cast, but only approximately 67%, 68% and 74%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. Since PPG's Articles of Incorporation require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of the Company's outstanding common stock to approve a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation to declassify the Board, the proposals failed to receive the required vote. For the reasons discussed below, the Board of Directors has resolved to present this proposal to the Company's shareholders again at this year's Annual Meeting. 
In its review of our classified board structure, the Board has carefully weighed the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a classified board structure. The Board considered that many U.S. public companies have eliminated their classified board structures in recent years in favor of annual elections and that many investors now consider the election of directors to be the primary means for shareholders to influence corporate governance policies and to increase a board's accountability. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly considers and evaluates a broad range of corporate governance issues affecting PPG and takes into consideration feedback we receive from our shareholders. Our Board has responded to shareholder feedback on our classified board structure by placing management proposals to eliminate our classified board before our shareholders. By placing the weight of management behind these proposals, these proposals were more likely to achieve a successful vote than had the Board decided only to include shareholder proposals on this topic in our Proxy Statements, as exemplified by the 74% vote received at the 2018 Annual Meeting – six percent higher than in 2013.
After carefully weighing these considerations, including shareholder opinion on this topic and the increased vote received on this proposal at PPG's 2018 annual meeting, the Board concluded that the annual election of all directors will both enhance our corporate governance practices and be an effective way to maintain and enhance the accountability of the Board. Accordingly, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to eliminate the classified board structure. 
PPG's Articles of Incorporation currently provide that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible with members of each class serving for three-year terms. If this proposal is approved, all directors will be elected annually beginning at the 2022 annual meeting. The directors to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting into the class whose term expires in 2022 will be elected to serve a full three-year term. The directors to be elected at the 2020 annual meeting will be elected to serve a two-year term. The directors to be elected at the 2021 annual meeting will be elected to serve a one-year term. At the 2022 annual meeting and at each meeting of shareholders thereafter, all directors will be elected annually. Because the declassification process discussed in this proposal would not be complete until the 2022 annual meeting, it would not operate to shorten the upcoming term of any of our directors nominated for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting, ensuring a smooth transition to annual elections of all of our directors. All directors elected to fill vacancies will hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires.
Complete Text of the Proposed Amendment
The general description of the proposed amendment to PPG's Articles of Incorporation set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, which are attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement.

PROPOSAL 5:  Proposal to Amend the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to Replace the Supermajority Voting Requirements
PPG's Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to PPG's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and PPG's Amended and Restated Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements set forth therein.
In 2014 and 2015, the Board considered this proposal, including the amount of shareholder support it received in the past, and proposed to amend PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements with a simple majority vote or the closest standard to a simple majority vote allowed by Pennsylvania law. At our 2014 and 2015 annual meetings, the Board's proposal to amend PPG's Articles and Bylaws received the support of the holders of approximately 99% of the votes cast at the meeting but only approximately 67% and 68%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. Since PPG's Articles of Incorporation and certain sections of PPG's Bylaws require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of the Company's outstanding common stock to approve a proposal to replace the supermajority voting requirements, the proposals failed to receive the required vote.
Considering the vote received at the 2014 and 2015 annual meetings and shareholder opinion on this topic, including a shareholder proposal received this year, the Board is again proposing to amend PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements with a simple majority vote or the closest standard to a simple majority vote allowed by Pennsylvania law. The Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "Pennsylvania BCL") provides that whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders of a business corporation, it will be authorized upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon.
PPG's Articles of Incorporation currently require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of PPG's outstanding common stock entitled to vote for shareholders to approve the following actions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· repealing the classified board structure;  
· changing the size of the Board beyond the parameters set forth in the Articles of Incorporation;  
· removing a director from office outside of the annual meeting process;  
· amending the provision of the Articles of Incorporation requiring a supermajority vote to approve certain business combinations with a party that owns 20% or more of PPG's shares; and  
· amending the director indemnification provisions. 
[END TABLE]
PPG's Bylaws currently require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the shares of PPG's outstanding common stock entitled to vote in order for shareholders to approve the following actions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· repealing the classified board structure;  
· removing a director from office outside the annual meeting process; and  
· amending the director liability and indemnification provisions. 
[END TABLE]
The proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws would reduce the voting requirements for these actions to require a vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote in each circumstance described above other than the business combination provision. The Pennsylvania BCL requires that certain business combinations between PPG and a person who owns 20% or more of PPG's shares (an interested shareholder) receive the affirmative vote of no less than the majority of the votes cast if the transaction meets certain criteria. However, depending on the form of the transaction, approval may require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of outstanding common stock, excluding the votes of the interested shareholders, or may require the affirmative vote of all of the shares of outstanding common stock. Therefore, the vote required to approve such a transaction would be reduced to the minimum vote required by the Pennsylvania BCL.
The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the supermajority voting requirements in PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Proponents of the elimination of supermajority voting requirements posit that these requirements impede accountability to shareholders and contribute to Board and management entrenchment. They argue that a minority of shareholders can block an 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  64    2019 Proxy Statement           						   
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents initiative supported by a majority of shareholders and that a simple majority vote requirement should be sufficient for any corporate action requiring shareholder approval. In this regard, the Board gave considerable weight to the fact that the 2014 and 2015 management proposals each received a substantial majority of votes in favor of the proposal and to the opinion of current PPG shareholders on this topic.
After carefully reviewing these considerations, the Nominating and Governance Committee determined, and the Board of Directors agreed, that it is in the best interest of PPG to replace the supermajority voting requirements. The Board concluded that replacement of the supermajority voting provisions will both enhance our corporate governance practices and be an effective way to maintain and enhance the accountability of PPG to its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to amend PPG's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to replace the supermajority voting requirements set forth therein.
Conforming Changes to PPG's Bylaws 
PPG's Bylaws also include supermajority voting provisions relating to the repeal of the classified board structure, removal of a director from office outside of the annual meeting process and amendment of the director liability and indemnification provisions that are consistent with the same provisions in the Articles of Incorporation. Conditional upon approval by the shareholders of the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws described in this proposal, PPG's Board has voted to remove the supermajority voting standards from the Bylaws and replace them with a standard requiring the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast and entitled to vote.
Complete Text of Proposed Amendment 
The general description of the proposed amendment to PPG's Articles of Incorporation and the proposed amendment to PPG's Bylaws set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws, which are attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively, to this Proxy Statement. Proposed additions are underlined, and proposed deletions are stricken through.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares of the Company's outstanding common stock entitled to vote (including abstentions) at the Annual Meeting will be required for approval of this proposal. If approved, the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation will become effective upon its filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which we intend to do following the Annual Meeting. If the proposal is approved, the Board will make conforming amendments to our Bylaws. If this proposal is not approved, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws will remain unchanged.

During 2017 and 2018, we retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In 2017 and 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided services in the following categories and amounts:

  Total All Fees         $  12.4  				        $     12.9  
    (1)      Fees related to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002, comfort letters, statutory and regulatory audits, consents, quarterly reviews and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards arising during the audits. The increase in Audit fees primarily relates to work surrounding the restatement disclosed in the 2017 Form 10-K/A. 
    (2)      Fees related to non-recurrent projects primarily related to acquisitions and divestitures. 
    (3)      Fees related to tax compliance, planning and advice. 
[END TABLE]
The majority of services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2018 were pre‑approved in accordance with the Audit Committee pre‑approval policy and procedures adopted at its February 14, 2018 meeting. Additional services were approved during the year as needed, in accordance with this policy. In so doing, the committee determined that the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence. In 2018, no services (which pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations were considered de minimis) were provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that were approved by the committee after such services were performed.
Audit Committee Pre‑approval Policy
The pre‑approval policy describes the permitted audit, audit‑related, tax and other services that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP may perform and lists a range of fees for these services (referred to as the Service List). The service and fee ranges listed in the pre‑approval policy are pre‑approved by the Audit Committee. If a type of service to be provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not included in the Service List, the committee must specifically pre‑approve it. Normally, pre‑approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to pre‑approve engagements has been delegated to the committee chair to accommodate time sensitive service proposals. Any pre‑approval decisions made by the chair must be communicated to the full committee at the next scheduled meeting.

PROPOSAL  6: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and, while they do not plan to make a statement (although they will have the opportunity if they desire to do so), they will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.
It is intended that the shares represented by each proxy will be voted, in the discretion of the persons appointed as proxies, FOR the ratification. If the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is ratified by our shareholders, the Audit Committee in its discretion could decide to terminate the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and engage another firm if the committee determines such action to be necessary or desirable.
Vote Required
The ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 will require the affirmative vote of more than one‑half of the shares present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote and voting (excluding abstentions) at the Annual Meeting.

    (1)      Each of the named beneficial owners has sole voting power and sole investment power as to all the shares beneficially owned by them with the exception of (i) shares held by certain of them jointly with, or directly by, their spouses and children and (ii) the common stock equivalents shown in the second column, and described more fully below, which have no voting power. 
    (2)      Shares of common stock considered to be "beneficially owned" include both common stock actually owned and shares of common stock as to which there is a right to acquire ownership on, or within 60 days after, February 22, 2019. These amounts reflect shares subject to options exercisable within 60 days of February 22, 2019: as follows: Mr. McGarry, 225,669; Mr. Bost, 38,132; Mr. Knavish, 20,100; and Mr. Morales, 12,300. These amounts also include shares held in the PPG Industries, Employee Savings Plan as of February 22, 2019 as follows: Mr. McGarry, 14,575; Mr. Bost, 22; Mr. Knavish, 4,725; and Mr. Morales, 6,150. In April 2018, each director received 1,227 time-based restricted stock units. The directors' restricted stock units granted in 2018 vest on April 17, 2019 and are included in the table because these restricted stock units vest within 60 days of February 22, 2019. To the Company's knowledge, none of the shares reflected in the table have been pledged. 
    (3)      Certain directors hold common stock equivalents in their accounts in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, which is described under "Deferred Compensation" on pages 26 through 27. Certain executive officers hold common stock equivalents in their accounts in the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is described under "Defined Contribution Retirement Plans and Deferred Compensation Plan" on pages 50 through 51. Common stock equivalents are hypothetical shares of common stock having a value on any given date equal to the value of a share of common stock. Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents that are converted into additional common stock equivalents, but carry no voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of common stock. Upon leaving the Company, the common stock equivalents are made available for distribution, and all distributions are made in the form of one share of PPG common stock for each common stock equivalent credited to the person's deferred account. 
    (4)      This is the sum of the beneficially owned common stock and the common stock equivalents as shown in the previous two columns. None of the identified beneficial owners holds more than 1.0% of the voting securities of PPG outstanding. The beneficial owners as a group hold less than 1.0% of the voting securities of PPG outstanding. 
    (5)      The group consists of 20 persons: the directors and executive officers named in this Proxy Statement and PPG's remaining executive officers: Messes. Amy R. Ericson and Anne M. Foulkes and Mr. Ramaprasad Vadlamannati.

The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the Fairmont Pittsburgh, Grand Ballroom, 510 Market Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222. 
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
In connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, these materials have been made available to you on the Internet or, upon your request or under certain other circumstances, have been delivered to you by mail in printed form.
If your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, as of the close of business on February 22, 2019, you are considered a shareholder of record, and we have sent you these proxy materials.
If your shares were held in the name of a bank, brokerage account or other nominee as of the close of business on February 22, 2019, you are considered a beneficial owner of the shares held in street name. Your bank, broker or other nominee has sent you these proxy materials. You should direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, and we encourage you to make such direction. If you do not make a direction with respect to Proposals 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, your bank, broker or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares on your behalf with respect to such proposals.
What is included in these materials?
These proxy materials include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Our Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting; and 
· Our 2018 Annual Report to shareholders, which includes our audited consolidated financial statements. 
[END TABLE]
If you received printed versions of these materials by mail, these materials also include the proxy card or vote instruction form for the Annual Meeting.
Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of printed proxy materials?
In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to our shareholders, we have elected to furnish these materials by providing access to these documents over the Internet. Accordingly, on or about March 7, 2019, we sent a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Internet Availability") to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners. All shareholders have the ability to access the proxy materials on a website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability.
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
It means you have multiple accounts at the transfer agent or with banks, brokers or other nominees. If you received more than one Notice of Internet Availability, you may need to enter separate electronic control voting numbers when voting by the Internet to ensure that all of your shares have been voted. If you received more than one proxy card or vote instruction form, please complete and provide your voting instructions for all proxy cards and vote instruction forms that you receive.
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?
The Notice of Internet Availability provides you with instructions regarding how to (1) view our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; (2) vote your shares after you have viewed our proxy materials; and (3) request a printed copy of the proxy materials.
Our proxy materials are also available online at www.ppg.com/investor.

If you (1) choose the "submit your vote" option without voting on each individual proposal when voting on the Internet or by telephone or (2) if you are a shareholder of record and sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement.
If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, the broker, bank or nominee will ask you how you want to vote your shares. If you give the broker, bank or nominee instructions, your shares will be voted as you direct. If you do not give instructions, your broker, bank or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal 6), but your broker, bank or nominee will not vote your shares at all with respect to any of the other proposals. We encourage you to provide instructions to your bank, broker or nominee by carefully following the instructions provided. This will ensure that your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting as you direct.

How can I change or revoke my vote after I have voted?
You have the right to change your vote or revoke your proxy before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting. You may vote again on a later date on the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or vote instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Annual Meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked. Please note that any re‑votes by mail or proxy revocations must be received by our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272 prior to the Annual Meeting in order to be effective.
How will shares in employee benefit plans be voted?
This Proxy Statement is being used to solicit voting instructions from you with respect to shares of PPG common stock that you own, but which are held by the trustees of a retirement or savings plan for the benefit of you and other plan participants. Shares held in the benefit plans that are entitled to vote will be voted by the trustees pursuant to your instructions. Shares held in any employee benefit plan that you are entitled to vote, but do not vote, will not be voted by the trustees. You must instruct the trustees to vote your shares by utilizing one of the voting methods described above.
Who will count and certify the votes?
Representatives of Corporate Election Services and the staff of our corporate secretary and Investor Relations offices will count the votes and certify the election results. The results will be publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Form 8‑K within four business days after the Annual Meeting.
How can I attend the Annual Meeting?
If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you must be a PPG shareholder on the record date of February 22, 2019, and you will need to bring an Admission Card and photo ID to the meeting. 
If you are a shareholder of record or a participant in a retirement or savings plan maintained by PPG and wish to attend the Annual Meeting, please indicate this desire when voting via the Internet or by telephone, so that we may send you an Admission Card. If you have a paper proxy card because you received the proxy materials in paper form, there is an Admission Card on the top half of the proxy card. Please tear off the Admission Card and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting, along with a photo ID.
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, Admission Cards can be printed by accessing Shareholder Meeting Registration at www.ProxyVote.com and following the instructions provided. You will need the 16 digit number included on your proxy card, voter instruction form or notice. If you are unable to print your Admission Card, please contact Broadridge at 1-855-449-0994 for assistance. You may also bring a legal proxy obtained from your bank, broker or other nominee. Alternatively, you may obtain an Admission Card by sending your request and a copy of your proof of ownership to Investor Relations at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, 40th Floor, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. Please bring your Admission Card and a photo ID to the Annual Meeting.
For security purposes, no cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, backpacks, briefcases or packages, other than for use by PPG, will be permitted in the meeting room or adjacent areas, and other items will be subject to search.
How do I obtain a copy of materials related to corporate governance?
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, charters of each standing committee of our Board of Directors, Global Code of Ethics, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and other materials related to our corporate governance are published on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor.
Who is soliciting my vote and what are the solicitation expenses?
This solicitation is being made on behalf of our Board of Directors, but may also be made without additional compensation by our directors, officers or employees by telephone, facsimile, e mail or personal interview. We will bear the expense of the preparation, printing and mailing of the Notice of Internet Availability and these proxy materials. We have hired D.F.

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents an estimated cost of $400,000 to $500,000 plus reimbursement of certain additional out of pocket expenses. We will request brokers, banks and other nominees who hold shares of PPG common stock in their names to furnish proxy materials to beneficial owners of the shares. We will reimburse these brokers, banks and nominees for their reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners.
How can I submit a proposal for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders?
To be considered for the 2020 annual meeting, shareholder proposals must be submitted in writing to our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272. No proposal can be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2020 annual meeting unless it is received by our corporate secretary no later than November 8, 2019. The proposal must also comply with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to shareholder proposals.
Any shareholder whose proposal is not included in our Proxy Statement relating to the 2020 annual meeting and who intends to present business for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting must give notice to our corporate secretary in accordance with Section 1.5 of our Bylaws (which are available on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.ppg.com/investor) and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action. If, as expected, the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders is held on April 16, 2020, then the notice must be received by our corporate secretary on or before January 17, 2020.
How can I recommend someone as a candidate for director?
A shareholder who wishes to recommend or nominate a candidate for director of PPG may write to the chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, in care of our corporate secretary at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272.
To be effective for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting, the recommendation or nomination must be received by our corporate secretary by the deadlines set forth in our Bylaws and must include information required under our Bylaws, including information about the nominating shareholder and information about the nominee that would be required to be included in a Proxy Statement under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Director nominations submitted pursuant to PPG's proxy access Bylaw for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting must be received by PPG no earlier than October 9, 2019 and no later than November 8, 2019. For additional information regarding the nomination procedure, see "Corporate Governance—Shareholder Recommendations or Nominations for Director and Proxy Access" on page 22.
OTHER INFORMATION
Householding Information
PPG and some banks, brokers and other nominees are participating in the practice of "householding" proxy materials. This means that shareholders who share the same address may not receive separate copies of proxy materials, unless we have received instructions to the contrary. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate set of the proxy materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and wish to receive only one, please notify your bank, broker or other nominee if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you hold registered shares. We will promptly deliver an additional copy of the proxy materials to you, without charge, if you write to Investor Relations at PPG Industries, Inc., One PPG Place, 40th Floor, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15272, or call us at (412) 434‑3318.
Other Matters
So far as is known, no matters other than those described herein are expected to come before the Annual Meeting. It is intended, however, that the proxies solicited hereby will be voted on any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, in the discretion of the person or persons voting such proxies unless the shareholder has indicated on the proxy card that the shares represented thereby are not to be voted on such other matters.

ANNEX A
RECONCILIATION OF NON‑GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
PPG believes investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for nonrecurring charges. PPG's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on an ongoing basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.
Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share from continuing operations—assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) are reconciled to adjusted net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations—assuming dilution below:

PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE SIXTH OF THE RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, OF PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. TO DECLASSIFY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Section 6.1 of Article Sixth of the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of PPG Industries, Inc. is proposed to be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
SIXTH.  The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors comprised as follows:
(a)The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than 9 nor more than 17 persons, the exact number to be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the directors then in office;
(b)Each director who is serving as a director immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or is elected thereafter as a director, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she has been elected, and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal from office. At the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the successors to the class of directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a two-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the successors to the class of directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and at each meeting of shareholders thereafter, each director shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Each director shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she is elected, and until his or her successor shall have been elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal from office;
(c)Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, any class of directors, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office by shareholder vote at any time, with or without assigning any cause, but only if shareholders entitled to cast at least 80% of the votes which all shareholders would be entitled to cast at an annual election of directors or of such class of directors shall vote in favor of such removal; and
(d)Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a quorum, except that vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the shareholders may be filled by the shareholders at the same meeting at which such removal occurs. All directors elected to fill vacancies shall hold office for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders at which the term of the class to which they have been elected expires, or in the case of directors elected at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and thereafter, the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal from office. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

For purposes of this Section 1.3, the first public disclosure of the date of any special meeting of shareholders or any annual meeting of shareholders held on a date other than the third Thursday in April shall be when disclosure of such meeting date is first made in a filing made by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in any notice given to the New York Stock Exchange, or in a news release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Reuters, Bloomberg, the Associated Press or comparable national news service.
(c)As to each person, if any, whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the Board of Directors pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 1.3(a) of these bylaws, a shareholder's notice must, in addition to the matters set forth in Section 1.6 of these bylaws, set forth:  (i) all information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), (ii) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder and the beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation, all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission if the shareholder making the nomination and the beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant; and (iii) a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement as required by Section 1.14 of these bylaws.  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine (A) the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee, (B) whether the proposed nominee has any direct or indirect relationship with the Corporation other than those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to the Corporation's corporate governance guidelines or its Policy and Procedures With Respect to Related Person Transactions, (C) whether the proposed nominee would, by serving on the Board of Directors, violate or cause the Corporation to be in violation of these bylaws, the Restated Articles of Incorporation , the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed or any applicable law, rule or regulation, and (D) whether the proposed nominee is or has been subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person by a shareholder not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.  Subject to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and Section 1.4 of these bylaws, nothing in these bylaws shall be construed to permit any shareholder, or give any shareholder the right, to include or have disseminated or described in the Corporation's proxy statement any nomination of a director or directors or any other business proposal.
Section 1.4         Inclusion of Shareholder Director Nominations in the Corporation's Proxy Materials.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these bylaws, the Corporation shall include in its proxy materials for a meeting of shareholders, provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such a meeting, the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the "Shareholder Nominee") to the Board of Directors by a shareholder or group of shareholders that satisfy the requirements of this Section 1.4, including qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder (as defined in paragraph (d) below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the written notice required by this Section 1.4 (a "Proxy Access

Notice") to have its nominee included in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4.  For the purposes of this Section 1.4:
(1)"Voting Stock" shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of Directors;
(2)"Constituent Holder" shall mean any shareholder, collective investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined in paragraph (d) below) or beneficial holder whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined in paragraph (d) below) or qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder (as defined in paragraph (d) below);
(3)"affiliate" and "associate" shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided,  however, that the term "partner" as used in the definition of "associate" shall not include any limited partner that is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership; and
(4)a shareholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to "own" only those outstanding shares of Voting Stock as to which the shareholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) possesses both (a) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares.  The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the shareholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either's affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either's affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either's affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either's affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder's or Constituent Holder's (or either's affiliate's) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or Constituent Holder (or either's affiliate), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index.  A shareholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall "own" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of Directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares.  A shareholder's (including any Constituent Holder's) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which such person has loaned such shares so long as such person has the retained the power to recall such shares at any time by the shareholder upon giving requisite notice or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which in all such cases of such proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement is revocable at any time by the shareholder.  The terms "owned," "owning" and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings.
(a)For purposes of this Section 1.4, the "Required Information" that the Corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that the Corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the Corporation's proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a Statement (as defined in paragraph (g) below).  The Corporation shall also include the name of the Shareholder Nominee in its proxy card.  For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these bylaws notwithstanding, the Corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Shareholder and/or Shareholder Nominee, including any information provided to the Corporation with respect to the foregoing.
(b)To be timely, a shareholder's Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the Corporation not more than 150 days and not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date (as stated in

In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the Corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.
(c)The number of Shareholder Nominees (including Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board of Directors' nominees) appearing in the Corporation's proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.4 (such greater number, the "Permitted Number"); provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by:
(i)         the number of such director candidates for which the Corporation shall have received one or more shareholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 1.3(b) of these bylaws plus the number of directors in office that were elected to the Board after being nominated at any of the two preceding annual meetings pursuant to such Section 1.3(b);
(ii)         the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case were elected or appointed to the Board or will be included in the Corporation's proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a shareholder or group of shareholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such shareholder or group of shareholders, from the Corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (ii) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least one full three-year term, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (ii) equals or exceeds one; and
(iii)         the number of directors in office for whom access to the Corporation's proxy materials was previously provided (or requested) pursuant to this Section 1.4, other than (A)  any such director referred to in this clause (iii) whose term of office will expire at such annual meeting and who is not seeking (or agreeing) to be nominated at such meeting for another term of office and (B) any such director referred to in this clause (iii) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least one full three-year term;
provided, that in no circumstance shall the Permitted Number exceed the number of directors to be elected at the applicable annual meeting as noticed by the Corporation; and provided, further, that in the event the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.  In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.4 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Shareholder will promptly upon request of the Corporation select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the Corporation.  If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one (1) Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.
(d)An "Eligible Shareholder" is one or more shareholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 1.4, and as of the record date for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the "Proxy Access Request Required Shares"), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the Corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of shareholders, and, if and to the extent that a shareholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20).  Two or more collective investment funds that are (I) part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer or (II) a "group of investment companies" as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (a "Qualifying

Fund") shall be treated as one shareholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shareholders in this paragraph (d), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this Section 1.4.  No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 1.4 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no shareholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder).  A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a shareholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (d), for purposes of determining the number of shareholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Shareholder's holdings.  For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three-year (3 year) period ending on that date and through the other applicable dates referred to above (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).
(e)No later than the final date when a nomination pursuant to this Section 1.4 may be delivered to the Corporation, an Eligible Shareholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide the information set forth in Section 1.6 of these bylaws to the Secretary of the Corporation and also provide following information in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation:
(i)         with respect to each Constituent Holder, the name and address of, and number of shares of Voting Stock owned by, such person;
(ii)         one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three-year (3 year) holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) calendar days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the Corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three (3) years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person's agreement to provide:
(A)         within ten (10) days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person's continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person's ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and
(B)         immediate notice if the Eligible Shareholder ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting of shareholders;
(iii)         any information relating to such Eligible Shareholder (including any Constituent Holder) and their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert therewith, and any information relating to such Eligible Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee(s), in each case that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement and form of proxy or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for the election of such Shareholder Nominee(s) in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;
(iv)         a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among the Eligible Shareholder (including any Constituent Holder) and its or their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each of such Eligible Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee(s), and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the Eligible Shareholder (including any Constituent Holder), or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of such rule and the Shareholder Nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(v)         a representation that such person:
(A)         acquired the Proxy Access Request Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control of the Corporation, and does not presently have such intent;

(B)         has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the Board of Directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Shareholder Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this Section 1.4;
(C)         has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a "participant" in another person's, "solicitation" within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual meeting other than its Shareholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors;
(D)         will not distribute to any shareholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the Corporation; and
(E)         will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the Corporation and its shareholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section 1.4;
(vi)         in the case of a nomination by a group of shareholders that together is such an Eligible Shareholder, the designation by all group members of one group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the nominating shareholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and
(vii)         an undertaking that such person agrees to:
(A)         assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation and each of its directors, officers, and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Shareholder's communications with the shareholders of the Corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Shareholder (including such person) provided to the Corporation; and
(B)         file with the Securities and Exchange Commission any solicitation by the Eligible Shareholder of shareholders of the Corporation relating to the annual meeting at which the Shareholder Nominee will be nominated.
In addition, no later than the final date on which a Proxy Access Notice may be submitted under this Section 1.4, a Qualifying Fund whose stock ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder must provide to the Secretary of the Corporation documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors that demonstrates that the funds included within the Qualifying Fund are either part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer.  In order to be considered timely, any information required by this Section 1.4 to be provided to the Corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the Corporation) (1) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than the fifth day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting.  For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Shareholder or other person to change or add any proposed Shareholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these bylaws) available to the Corporation relating to any defect.
(f)The Eligible Shareholder may provide to the Secretary of the Corporation, at the time the information required by this Section 1.4 is originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Shareholder's Shareholder Nominee (the "Statement").  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.4, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state any material fact, or would violate any applicable law or regulation.
(g)No later than the final date when a nomination pursuant to this Section 1.4 may be delivered to the Corporation, each Shareholder Nominee must provide the information set forth in Section 1.3(c) of these bylaws, the

Table of Contents completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 1.14 of these bylaws, and such additional information as necessary to permit the Board of Directors to determine if any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (i) below apply.
In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) or the Shareholder Nominee to the Corporation or its shareholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Corporation of any defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these bylaws) available to the Corporation relating to any such defect.
(h)Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation's proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of shareholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this Section 1.4 or any other provision of these bylaws, the Corporation's Restated Articles of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of shareholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of shareholders.
(i)The Corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 1.4, a Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of shareholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Shareholder Nominee, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation:
(i)         who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing independence of the Corporation's directors, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors;
(ii)         whose service as a member of the Board of Directors would violate or cause the Corporation to be in violation of these bylaws, the Restated Articles of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation;
(iii)         if the Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder) or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply in any material respect with its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.4 or any agreement, representation or undertaking required by this Section; or
(iv)         if the Eligible Shareholder ceases to be an Eligible Shareholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.
For the purposes of this paragraph (i), clauses (i) and (ii) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by the Shareholder Nominee, clause (iii) will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4 of the specific Shareholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Shareholder Nominee to be nominated; provided, however, that clause (iv) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Shareholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (iii) will result in the Voting Stock owned by such Eligible Shareholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Shareholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this Section 1.4 of all of the applicable shareholder's Shareholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of shareholders or, if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of such shareholder's Shareholder Nominees to be nominated).
Section 1.5         Other Matters Brought by Shareholders.  For business, other than nominations of director candidates, to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to clause (c) of Section 1.2 of these bylaws, the shareholder must give timely notice thereof, and timely updates and supplements with respect thereto, in writing to the Secretary and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action.

If the vote is taken by ballot, each ballot shall state the name of the shareholder voting and the number of shares voted by such shareholder, and if such ballot be cast by proxy, it shall state the name of the proxy voting and the number of shares voted as proxy.

Where a proxy or proxies represent the holders of shares entitled to cast in aggregate a sufficient number of votes to adopt a particular resolution, the vote of such proxy or proxies may, in the discretion of the presiding officer, constitute action by the shareholders.

Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of the shareholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons, but not more than three, to act for such shareholder by proxy.  Every proxy shall be executed or authenticated by the shareholder or by such shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact, in a manner authorized by applicable law and filed with or transmitted to the Secretary or the designated agent of the Corporation.
Section 1.12         Meeting Procedure.

The Secretary shall take the minutes of the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, the presiding officer shall designate any person to take the minutes of the meeting.  The presiding officer of any meeting shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the conduct of discussion as seems to such officer in order.  The conduct of meetings shall be governed by accepted corporate practice (not Roberts' Rules), the fundamental rule being that all who are entitled to take part shall be treated with fairness and good faith.

For purposes of this Section 1.13, a vote of the majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast "for" or "against" that director.
(b)If an incumbent director is running uncontested and is not elected as provided in subsection (a) of this Section 1.13, such director shall promptly offer to tender his or her irrevocable resignation to the Board.

The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board of Directors' decision with respect to such resignation.
(c)Any director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or to the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary of the Corporation.  Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified in the notice or, if no time is specified, immediately.

ARTICLE VI
INDEMNIFICATION
Section 6.1         Entitlement to Indemnification.  The Corporation shall, to the extent that a determination of entitlement is made pursuant to, or to the extent that entitlement to indemnification is otherwise accorded by, this Article, indemnify every person who was or is a director, officer or employee of the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnitee") who was or is involved in any manner (including, without limitation, as a party or a witness), or is threatened to be made so involved, in any threatened, pending or completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including, without limitation, any investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or other representative of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity (such investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding hereinafter being referred to as a "Proceeding") against any expenses and any liability actually and in good faith paid or incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding; provided, that indemnification may be made with respect to a Proceeding brought by an Indemnitee against the Corporation only as provided in the last sentence of this Section 6.1.  As used in this Article, the term "expenses" shall include fees and expenses of counsel and all other expenses (except any liability) and the term "liability" shall include amounts of judgments, fines or penalties and amounts paid in settlement.  Indemnification may be made under this Article for expenses incurred in connection with any Proceeding brought by an Indemnitee against the Corporation only if (1) the Proceeding is a claim for indemnification under this Article or otherwise, (2) the Indemnitee is successful in whole or in part in the Proceeding for which expenses are claimed, or (3) the indemnification for expenses is included in a settlement of, or is awarded by a court in, a Proceeding to which the Corporation is a party.

Section 6.2         Advancement of Expenses.  All expenses incurred in good faith by or on behalf of the Indemnitee with respect to any Proceeding shall, upon written request submitted to the Secretary of the Corporation, be advanced to the Indemnitee by the Corporation prior to final disposition of such Proceeding, subject to any obligation which may be imposed by law or by provision in the Articles, bylaws, an agreement or otherwise to repay the Corporation in certain events.
Section 6.3         Indemnification Procedure.
(a)To obtain indemnification under this Article, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including such supporting documentation as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to the making of a determination of whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  The Secretary of the Corporation shall promptly thereupon advise the General Counsel in writing of such request.
(b)The Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be determined by a Referee (selected as hereinafter provided) in a written opinion.  The Referee shall find the Indemnitee entitled to indemnification unless the Referee finds that the Indemnitee's conduct was such that, if so found by a court, indemnification would be prohibited by Pennsylvania law.
(c)"Referee" means an attorney with substantial expertise in corporate law who neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent:  (i) the Corporation or the Indemnitee, or an affiliate of either of them, in any matter material to either such party, except to act as a Referee in similar proceedings, or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Article.  The Corporation's General Counsel, if Disinterested (as hereinafter defined), or if not, the Corporation's senior officer who is Disinterested, shall propose a Referee.  The Secretary of the Corporation shall notify the Indemnitee of the name of the Referee proposed, whose appointment shall become final unless the Indemnitee, within 10 days of such notice, reasonably objects to such Referee as not being qualified, independent or unbiased.  If the Corporation and the Indemnitee cannot agree on the selection of a Referee, or if the Corporation fails to propose a Referee, within 45 days of the submission of a written request for indemnification, the Referee shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association.  The General Counsel or a senior officer shall be deemed "Disinterested" if not a party to the Proceeding and not alleged in the pleadings as to the Proceeding to have participated in the action, or participated in the failure to act, which is the basis for the relief sought in the Proceeding.
(d)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the extent that there has been a determination by a court as to the conduct of an Indemnitee such that indemnification would not be prohibited by Pennsylvania law, or if an Indemnitee would be entitled by Pennsylvania law to indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder.
(e)A determination under this Section 6.3 shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation but not on the Indemnitee.
Section 6.4         Partial Indemnification.  If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation of a portion, but not all, of the expenses or liability resulting from a Proceeding, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which the Indemnitee is entitled.
Section 6.5         Insurance.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Indemnitee against expenses and liability asserted or incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense or liability by law, under an agreement or under this Article.  The Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification.
Section 6.6         Agreements.  The Corporation may enter into agreements with any director, officer or employee of the Corporation, which agreements may grant rights to the Indemnitee or create obligations of the Corporation in furtherance of, different from, or in addition to, but not in limitation of, those provided in this Article, without shareholder approval of any such agreement.  Without limitation of the foregoing, the Corporation may obligate itself (1) to maintain insurance on behalf of the Indemnitee against certain expenses and liabilities and (2) to contribute

Table of Contents to expenses and liabilities incurred by the Indemnitee in accordance with the application of relevant equitable considerations to the relative benefits to, and the relative fault of, the Corporation.
Section 6.7         Miscellaneous.  The entitlement to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for in this Article (1) shall be a contract right, (2) shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee may otherwise be entitled under any Article, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or directors or otherwise, (3) shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and (4) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of any person entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article.
Section 6.8         Construction.  If any provision of this Article shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason (1) such provision shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable only to the extent of such prohibition and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the remaining provisions of this Article shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Section 6.9         Effectiveness.  This Article shall apply to every Proceeding other than a Proceeding filed prior to January 27, 1987, except that it shall not apply to the extent that Pennsylvania law does not permit its application to any breach of performance of duty or any failure of performance of duty by an Indemnitee occurring prior to January 27, 1987.
Section 6.10         Amendment.  This Article may be amended or repealed at any time in the future by vote of the directors without shareholder approval; provided, that any amendment or repeal, or adoption of any Article of the Restated Articles or any other bylaw of the Corporation, which has the effect of limiting the rights granted to directors under this Article, shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon.  Any amendment or repeal, or such Article or other bylaw, limiting the rights granted under this Article shall operate prospectively only, and shall not limit in any way the indemnification provided for herein with respect to any action taken, or failure to act, by an Indemnitee prior thereto.
ARTICLE VII

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of certificates for fractional shares or, in lieu thereof, scrip or other evidence of ownership, which may (or may not) as determined by the Board of Directors entitle the holder thereof to voting, dividends or other rights of shareholders.
Section 7.2         Transfer of Shares.  Transfers of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be made on the books of the Corporation only upon surrender to the Corporation of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed by the shareholder or by the shareholder's assignee, agent or legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of assignment, authority or legal succession, or by the agent of one of the foregoing thereunto duly authorized by an instrument duly executed and filed with the Corporation in accordance with regular commercial practice.
Section 7.3         Holders of Record.  The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock of the Corporation as the holder and owner in fact thereof for all purposes and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in any share on the part of any person other than the registered holder thereof, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided by law.

Section 7.4         Replacement.  Each duly appointed transfer agent and registrar of the Corporation may issue and register, respectively, from time to time, without further action or approval by or on behalf of the Corporation, new certificates of stock of the Corporation to replace certificates claimed to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon receipt by the transfer agent of an Affidavit of Loss and Bond of Indemnity in such amount and upon such terms as may be required by the transfer agent to protect the Corporation, the transfer agent and registrar against all loss, cost or damage arising from the issuance of such new certificates, provided that a Bond of Indemnity shall not be required where not more than five shares of stock are involved.
