As to the approval of the FFBW, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, by checking the appropriate box, a stockholder may: (i) vote FOR the proposal; (ii) vote AGAINST the proposal; or (iii) ABSTAIN from voting on such proposal. The approval of this matter requires the affirmative vote of (x) a majority of the votes represented at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter and (y) a majority of the votes cast by stockholders other than FFBW, MHC. For purposes of the vote required in clause (x), above, abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal, and for purposes of the vote required in clause (y), above, abstentions will not affect the outcome of the vote. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote under either clause (x) or clause (y).
Participants in the First Federal Bank of Wisconsin Employee Stock Ownership Plan
If you participate in the First Federal Bank of Wisconsin Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"), you will receive a Vote Authorization Form for the ESOP that reflects all of the shares you may direct the trustees to vote on your behalf under the ESOP. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the ESOP, but each ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the proportionate interest of shares of our common stock allocated or deemed allocated to his or her account. The ESOP trustee, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, will vote all unallocated shares of our common stock held by the ESOP and allocated or deemed allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions, subject to a determination that such vote is in the best interest of ESOP participants. The deadline for returning your ESOP Vote Authorization Form is November 21, 2018 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time. The telephone and internet voting deadline for ESOP participants is also 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on November 21, 2018.

Benefit Plans and Agreements
Employment Agreements. In connection with the reorganization and stock offering, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Edward H. Schaefer and Ms. Nikola B. Schaumberg, effective as of May 24, 2017. Each agreement has similar terms; however, Mr. Schaefer's agreement has an initial term of three years and Ms. Schaumberg's agreement has an initial term of eighteen months. Commencing on the first anniversary of the agreements and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the agreements will be renewed for an additional year so that the remaining term will be three years for Mr. Schaefer's agreement and eighteen months for Ms. Schaumberg's agreement, unless a notice is provided to the executive that the agreement will not renew. Both agreements were renewed in 2018. The current base salaries for Mr. Schaefer and Ms. Schaumberg are $240,000 and $135,000, respectively. Mr. Schaefer's salary was adjusted as club dues were discontinued in 2018. In addition to the base salary, each agreement provides for, among other things, participation in bonus programs and other fringe benefit plans applicable to executive employees. The executive's employment may be terminated for cause at any time, in which event the executive would have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination.
Certain events resulting in the executive's termination or resignation entitle the executive to payments of severance benefits following termination of employment. In the event of the executive's involuntary termination for reasons other than for cause, disability or retirement, or in the event the executive resigns during the term of the agreement following (a) failure to appoint the executive to the executive position set forth in the agreement, (b) a material change in the executive's function, duties or responsibilities resulting in a reduction of the responsibility, scope, or importance of executive's position, (c) relocation of the executive's office by more than 30 miles, (d) a material reduction in the benefits or perquisites paid to the executive unless such reduction is part of a reduction that is generally applicable to officers or employees of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, (e) a material breach of the employment agreement by First Federal Bank of Wisconsin or (f) for Mr. Schaefer's agreement only, failure to elect the executive to the board of directors of FFBW, Inc., FFBW, MHC or First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, then the executive would be entitled to a severance payment in the form of a cash lump sum equal to the base salary and bonus the executive would be entitled to receive for the remaining unexpired term of the employment agreement. For this purpose, the bonuses payable will be deemed to be equal to the highest bonus paid at any time during the prior three years. In addition, the executive would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the contributions that would reasonably have been expected to be made on executive's behalf under First Federal Bank of Wisconsin's defined contribution plans (e.g., 401(k) Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan) if the executive had continued working for the remaining unexpired term of the employment agreement earning the salary that would have been achieved during such period. Internal Revenue Code Section 409A may require that a portion of the above payments cannot be made until six months after termination of employment, if the executive is a "key employee" under IRS rules. In addition, the executive would be entitled, at no expense to the executive, to the continuation of life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental coverage for the remaining unexpired term of the employment agreement, or, if participation by the executive is not permitted under the terms of the applicable health plans, or if providing such benefits would subject First Federal Bank of Wisconsin to penalties, then First Federal Bank of Wisconsin shall pay the executive a cash lump sum payment reasonably estimated to be equal to the cost of such non-taxable medical and dental benefits.
In the event of a change in control of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin or FFBW, Inc., followed by executive's involuntary termination other than for cause, disability or retirement, or resignation for one of the reasons set forth above within 18 months thereafter, the executive would be entitled to a severance payment in the form of a cash lump sum equal to (a) three (3) times for Mr. Schaefer (1.5 times for Ms. Schaumberg) the sum of (i) the highest rate of base salary paid to the executive at any time, and (ii) the highest bonus paid to the executive with respect to the three (3) completed fiscal years prior to the change of control, plus (b) a lump sum equal to the present value of the contributions that would reasonably have been expected to be made on the executive's behalf under First Federal Bank of Wisconsin's defined contribution plans (e.g., 401(k) Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan) if the executive had continued working for an additional thirty-six (36) months after termination of employment (or for Ms. Schaumberg, for the remaining term of her agreement), earning the salary that would have been achieved during such period. In addition, the executive would be entitled, at no expense to the executive, to the continuation of life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental coverage for thirty-six (36) months following the termination of employment (or for Ms. Schaumberg, for the remaining term of her agreement), or if providing such benefits would subject First Federal Bank of Wisconsin to penalties, then First Federal Bank of Wisconsin shall pay the executive a cash lump sum payment reasonably estimated to be equal to the cost of such non-taxable medical and dental benefits. In the event payments made to the executive include an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, such payments will be cutback by the minimum dollar amount necessary to avoid this result.
Under each employment agreement, if an executive becomes disabled within the meaning of such term under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the executive shall receive benefits under any short-term or long-term disability plans maintained by First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, plus, if the amount paid under such disability programs are less than the executive's base salary, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin shall pay the executive an additional amount equal to the difference between such disability plan benefits and the amount of the executive's full base salary for one year following the termination of employment due to disability. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin will also provide the executive with continued non-taxable medical and dental coverage until the earlier of (i) the date the executive returns to full-time employment with First Federal Bank of Wisconsin, (ii) the executive's full-time employment with another employer, (iii) one year following the termination of employment due to disability, or (iv) death.
In the event of executive's death, the executive's estate or beneficiaries will be paid the executive's base salary for one year from executive's death, and the executive's family will be entitled to continued non-taxable medical and dental insurance for twelve months following the executive's death.
Upon termination of the executive's employment, the executive shall be subject to certain restrictions on their ability to compete for a period of six months following termination of employment, or to solicit business or employees of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin and FFBW, Inc. for a period of one year following termination of employment.
Deferred Compensation Agreements. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin has entered into a deferred compensation agreement with Mr. Edward H. Schaefer. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Schaefer is entitled to the value of the account balance upon his termination of employment or death. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin will credit Mr. Schaefer's account balance with $55,000 as of June 30, 2017, and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin will make an additional contribution of $55,000 on each subsequent June 30th through June 30, 2021, for a total contribution of $275,000, provided that Mr. Schaefer is employed with First Federal Bank of Wisconsin on the date of such contribution. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin may, in its sole discretion, make additional contributions to the account balance.
           Life Insurance Agreement. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin is party to a life insurance agreement with Mr. Schaefer pursuant to which First Federal Bank of Wisconsin has purchased a life insurance policy on Mr. Schaefer's life. Under the agreement, the beneficiary is entitled to a death benefit paid by the insurer from the policy proceeds equal to $85,000.
401(k) Plan. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin maintains the First Federal Bank of Wisconsin Profit Sharing Plan ("401(k) Plan"). Employees who have attained age 21 and completed 1,000 hours of service are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 100% of his or her salary in any plan year, subject to limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2018, the salary deferral contribution limit is $18,500, provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $6,000, for a total contribution of $24,500. Beginning in 2017, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin matches 100% of participant salary deferrals up to 4% of a participant's annual compensation. Generally, unless the participant elects otherwise, the participant's account balance will be distributed as a result of his or her termination of employment with First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. Each participant has an individual account under the 401(k) Plan and may direct the investment of his or her account among a variety of investment options.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In connection with the reorganization and stock offering, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin adopted an employee stock ownership plan for eligible employees. Eligible employees begin participation in the employee stock ownership plan upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee's completion of 1,000 hours of service during a continuous 12-month period.
The employee stock ownership plan trustee purchased, on behalf of the employee stock ownership plan, 3.92% of our outstanding shares (including shares issued to FFBW, MHC and the charitable foundation). The employee stock ownership plan funded its stock purchase with a loan from FFBW, Inc. equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The loan will be repaid principally through First Federal Bank of Wisconsin's contribution to the employee stock ownership plan and dividends payable on common stock held by the employee stock ownership plan over the anticipated 20-year term of the loan. The interest rate for the employee stock ownership plan loan is a fixed rate equal to the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, on the closing date of the offering.
The trustee will hold the shares purchased by the employee stock ownership plan in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loan is repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant's proportional share of compensation relative to all participants. Each participant will vest in his or her benefit at a rate of 20% per year, such that the participant will be fully vested upon completion of five years of credited service. However, each participant who was employed by First Federal Bank of Wisconsin prior to the offering will receive credit for vesting purposes for years of service prior to the adoption of the employee stock ownership plan. A participant also will become fully vested automatically in his or her benefit upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the employee stock ownership plan. Generally, a participant will receive a distribution from the employee stock ownership plan upon separation from service.
The employee stock ownership plan permits a participant to direct the trustee as to how to vote the shares of common stock allocated to his or her account. The trustee votes unallocated shares and allocated shares for which participants do not provide instructions on any matter in the same ratio as those shares for which participants provide instructions, subject to fulfillment of the trustee's fiduciary responsibilities.
Under applicable accounting requirements, First Federal Bank of Wisconsin will record a compensation expense for the employee stock ownership plan at the fair market value of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to each participant's account. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in FFBW Inc.'s earnings.

PROPOSAL I − APPROVAL OF THE FFBW, INC. 2018 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
The Board of Directors has adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the FFBW, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Equity Incentive Plan"), to provide officers, employees and directors of FFBW, Inc. and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin with additional incentives to promote the growth and performance of FFBW, Inc. and First Federal Bank of Wisconsin. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee believe that the adoption of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is in the best interests of FFBW, Inc. and its stockholders as such plan will provide First Federal Bank of Wisconsin with the ability to retain and reward and, to the extent necessary, attract and incentivize its employees, officers, directors and other service providers to promote growth, improve performance and further align their interests with those of FFBW, Inc.'s stockholders through the ownership of additional common stock of FFBW, Inc.
Why We Are Seeking Approval of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan
Many companies that we compete with for directors and management-level employees are public companies that offer equity compensation as part of their overall director and officer compensation programs. By approving the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, our stockholders will give us the flexibility we need to continue to attract and retain highly qualified officers and directors by offering a competitive compensation program that is linked to the performance of our common stock. In addition, the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is intended to further align the interests of our directors and management with the interests of our stockholders by potentially increasing the ownership interests of directors and officers in the common stock of FFBW, Inc.
We completed our mutual holding company reorganization and related minority stock offering in October 2017. As part of the mutual holding company reorganization and minority stock offering, we issued a total of 6,612,500 shares of common stock, including 3,636,875 issued to FFBW, MHC, our mutual holding company. We raised approximately $29.6 million in gross proceeds from the minority stock offering. A substantial majority of financial institutions that complete a mutual holding company reorganization and related minority stock offering or a mutual-to-stock conversion have adopted an equity-based incentive plan following the transaction. Our prospectus made clear our intent to adopt an equity incentive plan and described the regulatory requirements potentially applicable to a plan. Our prospectus also included the pro forma effect of awards granted under an equity incentive plan.
Highlights of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Share Reserve and Terms Consistent with Industry Standards. In determining the size and terms of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee considered a number of factors, including: (1) industry practices related to the adoption of equity-incentive plans by financial institutions following mutual holding company reorganization or a mutual-to-stock conversion; and (2) applicable regulations related to the adoption of equity-incentive plans by converted financial institutions. In this regard (and as described below), the maximum number of shares of common stock that may delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options is 4.9% of the number of shares of common stock issued in the reorganization and minority stock offering, including shares issued to the mutual holding company and our charitable foundation, and the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units is 1.96% of the number of shares of common stock issued in the reorganization and minority stock offering, including the shares issued to the mutual holding company and charitable foundation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Minimum Vesting Periods for Awards. Subject to limited exceptions in the event of death, disability or involuntary termination without cause following a change in control, the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan requires a one-year minimum vesting period for at least 95% of the awards granted under the Plan. Unless the Compensation Committee specifies a different vesting schedule, awards will be granted with a vesting rate of 20% per year, with the first installment vesting on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Limits on Grants to Directors. Each non-employee director who is in the service of FFBW, Inc. immediately following the 2018 annual stockholder meeting will automatically be granted 9,257 stock options (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be granted 13,886 stock options), which represents approximately 3.53% and 5.30%, respectively, of the maximum number of stock options available for grant, and each non-employee director will automatically be granted 4,574 restricted stock awards (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be granted 6,863 restricted stock awards), which represents approximately 3.53% and 5.30%, respectively, of the maximum number of restricted stock awards available for grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Limits on Grants to Employees.  The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered to any one employee pursuant to the exercise of stock options and pursuant to restricted stock awards is 25% of the shares available for grant or award, respectively, under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Share Counting. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan provides that, if an award is forfeited or expires, the shares covered by the award will be available for future grant, while shares withheld to cover taxes or used to pay the exercise price of stock options will not be available for future grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No Cash-Out or Repricing of Underwater Options.  The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan prohibits repricing and exchange of underwater options for cash or shares without stockholder approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No Single-Trigger Vesting.  The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan does not provide for vesting of stock options or restricted stock awards based solely on the occurrence of a change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Awards Subject to Clawback.  Awards granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan are subject to clawback if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws or the forfeiture provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Awards may also be subject to clawback under any other clawback policy adopted by the Company from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
General
The following is a summary of the material features of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, attached hereto as Appendix A. In the event of conflict between the terms of this disclosure and the terms of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, the terms of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will control.
Subject to permitted adjustments for certain corporate transactions, the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of up to 453,617 shares of FFBW, Inc. common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards. Of this number, the maximum number of shares of FFBW, Inc. common stock that may be issued under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options is 324,012 shares, and the maximum number of shares of FFBW, Inc. common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards is 129,605 shares. These amounts represent 4.9% and 1.96%, respectively, of the number of shares of common stock issued in the mutual holding company reorganization of First Federal Bank of Wisconsin and the stock offering of FFBW, Inc., including the shares issued to FFBW, MHC and our charitable foundation.
The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be administered by the members of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") who are "Disinterested Board Members," as defined in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The Committee has full and exclusive power within the limitations set forth in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan to make all decisions and determinations regarding: (1) the selection of participants and the granting of awards; (2) establishing the terms and conditions relating to each award; (3) adopting rules, regulations and guidelines for carrying out the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan's purposes; and (4) interpreting the provisions of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and any award agreement. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan also permits the Committee to delegate all or part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it.
Except for accelerating the vesting of awards to avoid the minimum requirements specified in the plan, the Compensation Committee has the authority to reduce, eliminate or accelerate any restrictions or vesting requirements applicable to an award at any time after the grant of the award or to extend the time period to exercise a stock option, provided that such extension is consistent with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
Eligibility
Each employee or director of FFBW, Inc. or any subsidiary is eligible to receive awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, except that non-employees may not be granted incentive stock options.
Types of Awards
The Committee may determine the type and terms and conditions of awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, which will be set forth in an award agreement delivered to each participant. Awards may be granted as incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards or any combination thereof, as follows.
Stock Options. A stock option gives the recipient or "optionee" the right to purchase shares of common stock at a specified price for a specified period of time. The exercise price may not be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option is granted. Fair market value for purposes of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan means the final sales price of FFBW, Inc.'s common stock as reported on any national securities exchange on which the common stock may from time to time be listed or traded on the date the option is granted, or if FFBW, Inc.'s common stock was not traded on such date, then on the day prior to such date or on the next preceding day on which FFBW, Inc.'s common stock was traded, and without regard to after-hours trading activity. The Committee will determine the fair market value, in accordance with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, if it cannot be determined in the manner described herein. Further, the Committee may not grant a stock option with a term that is longer than 10 years.
Stock options are either "incentive" stock options or "non-qualified" stock options. Incentive stock options have certain tax advantages and must comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Only employees are eligible to receive incentive stock options. Shares of common stock purchased upon the exercise of a stock option must be paid for in full at the time of exercise: (1) either in cash or with stock valued at fair market value as of the day of exercise; (2) by a "cashless exercise" through a third party; (3) by a net settlement of the stock option using a portion of the shares obtained on exercise in payment of the exercise price of the stock option; (4) by personal, certified or cashiers' check; (5) by other property deemed acceptable by the Committee; or (6) by a combination of the foregoing. Stock options are subject to vesting conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee.
Restricted Stock. A restricted stock award is a grant of common stock, subject to vesting requirements, to a participant for no consideration or minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law. Restricted stock awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be granted only in whole shares of common stock and are subject to vesting conditions and other restrictions established by the Committee as set forth in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan or the award agreement. Awards will be evidenced by award agreements approved by the Committee, which set forth the terms and conditions of each award. Prior to their vesting, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the recipient of a restricted stock award may exercise any voting rights with respect to common stock subject to an award and receive any dividends and distributions with respect to the common stock.
Limitations on Awards Under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan
The following limits apply to awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be available for awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is 453,617 shares, of which up to 324,012 shares of common stock may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options and 129,605 shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered to any one employee pursuant to the exercise of stock options and pursuant to restricted stock awards is 81,003 shares and 32,401 shares, respectively (all of which may be granted in any one calendar year). Such maximum amount represents 25% of the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options and 25% of the number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Each non-employee director who is in the service of FFBW, Inc. immediately following the 2018 annual stockholder meeting will automatically be granted 9,257 stock pptions (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be granted 13,886 stock options), which represents 3.53% and 5.30% of the maximum number of stock options available for grant, respectively, and each non-employee director will automatically be granted 4,574 restricted stock awards (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be granted 6,863 restricted stock awards), which represents 3.53% and 5.30% of the maximum number of restricted stock awards available for grant, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered to any one non-employee director pursuant to the exercise of stock options is 16,200 shares, and the issuance of restricted stock awards is 6,480 shares (6,900 shares to the Chairman of the Board of Directors), all of which may be granted in any one calendar year). Such maximum amount represents 5% of the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options and 5% (5.32% for the Chairman of the Board of Directors) of the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered to all non-employee directors, in the aggregate, pursuant to the exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock awards is 97,203 shares and 38,881 shares, respectively (all of which may be granted in any one calendar year). Such maximum amount represents 30% of the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options and 30% of the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards.  
[END TABLE]
In the event of a corporate transaction involving the stock of FFBW, Inc. (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split or other special and nonrecurring dividend or distribution, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the Committee will, in an equitable manner, adjust the number and kind of securities deemed to be available for grants of stock options, restricted stock awards, the number and kind of securities that may be delivered or deliverable with respect to outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, and the exercise price of stock options.
In addition, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units.
Prohibition Against Repricing of Options. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan provides that neither the Committee nor the Board is authorized to make any adjustment or amendment that reduces or would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of a stock option that has been previously granted.
Prohibition on Transfer. Generally, all awards, except non-qualified stock options, granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be nontransferable except by will or in accordance with the laws of intestate succession. Restricted stock awards may be transferable pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. At the Committee's sole discretion, non-qualified stock options may be transferred for valid estate planning purposes that are permitted by the Internal Revenue Code and federal securities laws. During the life of the participant, awards can be exercised only by the participant. The Committee may permit a participant to designate a beneficiary to exercise or receive any rights that may exist under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan upon the participant's death.
Vesting of Awards
The Committee will specify the vesting schedule or conditions of each award. Unless the Committee specifies a different vesting schedule at the time of grant, awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan must be granted with a vesting rate not exceeding 20% per year. If the vesting of an award under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is conditioned on the completion of a specified period of service with FFBW, Inc. or its subsidiaries, without the achievement of performance measures or objectives, then the required period of service for full vesting will be determined by the Committee and evidenced in an award agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, awards under the plan may not vest more rapidly than in equal installments over a period of three years, with the initial installment vesting no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, unless accelerated due to death, disability or involuntary termination of employment or service following a change in control. Vesting may be accelerated in the event of death, disability, or upon involuntary termination of employment or service following a change in control or, subject to the foregoing requirements, at the discretion of the Committee, including due to retirement.
Change in Control
Unless otherwise stated in an award agreement, at the time of an involuntary termination of employment or service following a change in control, all stock options then held by the participant will become fully earned and exercisable (subject to the expiration provisions otherwise applicable to the stock option). All stock options may be exercised for a period of one year following the participant's involuntary termination, provided, however, that no stock option will be eligible for treatment as an incentive stock option in the event such stock option is exercised more than three months following involuntary termination following a change in control. At the time of an involuntary termination of employment or service following a change in control, all awards of restricted stock will become fully earned and vested immediately.
Amendment and Termination
The Board of Directors may, at any time, amend or terminate the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan or any award granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, provided that, except as provided in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, no amendment or termination may adversely impair the rights of a participant or beneficiary under an award without the participant's (or affected beneficiary's) written consent. The Board of Directors may not amend the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan to materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the plan, materially increase the aggregate number of securities that may be issued under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (other than as provided in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan), or materially modify the requirements for participation in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, without approval of stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan or any award agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, to conform the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan or the award agreement to current or future law or to avoid an accounting treatment resulting from an accounting pronouncement or interpretation issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission or Financial Accounting Standards Board subsequent to the adoption of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or the making of the award affected thereby, which, in the sole discretion of the Committee, may materially and adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of FFBW, Inc.
Duration of Plan
The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will become effective upon approval by the stockholders at the 2018 annual stockholder meeting. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will remain in effect as long as any awards under it are outstanding; however, no awards may be granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan on or after the 10-year anniversary of the effective date of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. At any time, the Board of Directors may terminate the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. However, any termination of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will not affect outstanding awards.
Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following is a summary of the federal income tax consequences that may arise in conjunction with participation in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan.
Non-Qualified Stock Options. The grant of a non-qualified option will not result in taxable income to the participant. Except as described below, the participant will realize ordinary income at the time of exercise in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the exercise price for those shares, and FFBW, Inc. will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. Gains or losses realized by the participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the cost basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.
Incentive Stock Options. The grant of an incentive stock option will not result in taxable income to the participant. The exercise of an incentive stock option also will not result in taxable income to the participant provided the participant was, without a break in service, an employee of FFBW, Inc. or a subsidiary during the period beginning on the date of the grant of the option and ending on the date three months prior to the date of exercise (one year prior to the date of exercise if the participant is disabled, as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code).
The excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the exercise of an incentive stock option over the exercise price is an adjustment that is included in the calculation of the participant's alternative minimum taxable income for the tax year in which the incentive stock option is exercised. For purposes of determining the participant's alternative minimum tax liability for the year of disposition of the shares acquired pursuant to the incentive stock option exercise, the participant will have a basis in those shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise.
If the participant does not sell or otherwise dispose of the shares within two years from the date of the grant of the incentive stock option or within one year after the exercise of such stock option, then, upon disposition of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed as a capital gain. A capital loss will be recognized to the extent that the amount realized is less than the exercise price.
If the foregoing holding period requirements are not met, the participant will generally realize ordinary income at the time of the disposition of the shares, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price; or (2) the excess, if any, of the amount realized upon disposition of the shares over the exercise price, and FFBW, Inc., Inc. will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. If the amount realized exceeds the value of the shares on the date of exercise, any additional amount will be a capital gain. If the amount realized is less than the exercise price, the participant will recognize no income, and a capital loss will be recognized equal to the excess of the exercise price over the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares.
Restricted Stock. A participant who has been granted a restricted stock award will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, provided that the stock subject to the award is not delivered at the time of grant, or if the stock is delivered, it is subject to restrictions that constitute a "substantial risk of forfeiture" for federal income tax purposes. Upon the later of delivery or vesting of shares subject to an award, the holder will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the then fair market value of those shares and FFBW, Inc. will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. Gains or losses realized by the participant upon disposition of such shares will be treated as capital gains and losses, with the basis in such shares equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of delivery or vesting. Dividends paid to the holder during the restriction period, if so provided, will also be compensation income to the participant, and FFBW, Inc. will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. A participant who makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code will include the full fair market value of the restricted stock award in taxable income in the year of grant at the grant date fair market value.
Withholding of Taxes. FFBW, Inc. may withhold amounts from participants to satisfy withholding tax requirements. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, participants may have shares withheld from awards to satisfy the minimum tax withholding requirements or an amount up to the participant's highest marginal tax rate required for federal, state and local tax withholding, provided such withholding does not trigger adverse accounting consequences.
Change in Control. Any acceleration of the vesting or payment of awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan in the event of a change in control or termination of employment or service following a change in control may cause part or all of the consideration involved to be treated as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, which may subject the participant to a 20% excise tax and preclude deduction by FFBW, Inc. related to the awards.
Deduction Limits. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits our ability to deduct for tax purposes compensation in excess of $1.0 million per year for each of our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and other executive officers named in the summary compensation table (each, a "covered employee") of our annual proxy statement, as well as any employee who has been designated a covered employee for any fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2016. Compensation resulting from awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be counted toward the $1.0 million limit.
Tax Advice. The preceding discussion is based on federal tax laws and regulations currently in effect, which are subject to change, and the discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the federal income tax aspects of the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. A participant may also be subject to state and local taxes in connection with the grant of awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. FFBW, Inc. suggests that participants consult with their individual tax advisors to determine the applicability of the tax rules to the awards granted to them in their personal circumstances.
Accounting Treatment
Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, FFBW, Inc. is required to recognize compensation expense on its income statement over the requisite service period or performance period based on the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation (such as restricted stock).
Awards to be Granted to Non-Employee Directors
Each non-employee director who is in the service of FFBW, Inc. on the date of the 2018 annual stockholder meeting will automatically be granted the following stock options and restricted stock awards, as of the date of the 2018 annual stockholder meeting, provided that stockholders approve the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan:

 (1)   Amounts are not determinable, as the actual value of the stock options realized will depend on the extent to which the fair market value of FFBW, Inc. common stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of exercise.  
[END TABLE]
It is expected that the stock option and restricted stock awards will vest over a five-year period, with 20% becoming vested after the completion of one year of service following the date of grant and then 20% percent becoming vested each year of continued service thereafter for the next four years. The exercise price of the stock options will equal the fair market value of FFBW, Inc. common stock on the actual date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these awards would vest upon death, disability or involuntary termination of employment following a change in control.
The Compensation Committee reviewed survey data regarding awards made to directors of other financial institutions that had undertaken a mutual-to-stock conversion and related stock offering. The Compensation Committee believes the proposed awards are reasonable and intended to align the economic interest of the directors with that of other stockholders, consistent with prevailing compensation practices in the competitive marketplace for similarly-situated financial institutions.
Any future grants to employees and directors under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
Clawback Policy
The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan provides that if FFBW, Inc. is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to its material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, any participant who is subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or who is subject to clawback under Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act must reimburse FFBW, Inc. with the required amount of any payment in settlement of an award earned or accrued during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. In addition, awards granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan are subject to any clawback policy adopted by the Board of Directors.
Required Vote and Recommendation of the Board
In order to approve the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of (x) a majority of the votes represented at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter, as well as (y) a majority of the votes cast by stockholders other than FFBW, MHC. For purposes of the vote required in clause (x), above, abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal, and for purposes of the vote required in clause (y), above, abstentions will not affect the outcome of the vote. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote under either clause (x) or clause (y).

Appendix A
FFBW, INC.
2018 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
ARTICLE 1 – GENERAL
Section 1.1     Purpose, Effective Date and Term.  The purpose of the FFBW, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to promote the long-term financial success of FFBW, Inc. (the "Company"), and its Subsidiaries, including First Federal Bank of Wisconsin (the "Bank"), by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company's stockholders through the ownership of additional common stock of the Company. The Plan also provides eligible Participants with an opportunity to acquire an ownership interest, or otherwise increase their ownership interest, in the Company as an incentive for them to remain in the service of the Company and the Bank. The "Effective Date" of the Plan shall be the date the Plan satisfies the applicable stockholder approval requirements.  The Plan shall remain in effect as long as any Awards are outstanding; provided, however, that no Awards may be granted under the Plan after the day immediately prior to the ten-year anniversary of the Effective Date.
Section 1.2     Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee") in accordance with Section 5.1.
Section 1.3     Participation.  Each Employee or Director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who is granted an Award in accordance with the terms of the Plan shall be a "Participant" in the Plan.  The grant of Awards shall be limited to Employees and Directors of the Company or any Subsidiary.
Section 1.4     Definitions.  Capitalized terms used in this Plan are defined in Article 8 and elsewhere in this Plan.
ARTICLE 2 - AWARDS
Section 2.1     General.  Any Award under the Plan may be granted singularly or in combination with another Award (or Awards).  Each Award under the Plan shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and such additional terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Committee shall provide with respect to such Award and as evidenced in the Award Agreement.  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.6, an Award may be granted as an alternative to or replacement of an existing Award under the Plan or any other plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plan or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including without limitation the plan of any entity acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary.  The types of Awards that may be granted under the Plan include:
(a)      Stock Options.  A Stock Option means a grant under Section 2.2 that represents the right to purchase shares of Stock at an Exercise Price established by the Committee.  Any Stock Option may be either an Incentive Stock Option (an "ISO") that is intended to satisfy the requirements applicable to an "Incentive Stock Option" described in Code Section 422(b), or a Non-Qualified Stock Option (a "Non-Qualified Option") that is not intended to be an ISO; provided, however, that no ISOs may be granted: (i) after the day immediately prior to the ten-year anniversary of the Effective Date or the date the Plan is approved by the Board, whichever is earlier; or (ii)  to a non-employee.  Unless otherwise specifically provided by its terms, any Stock Option granted to an Employee under this Plan shall be an ISO to the maximum extent permitted. Any ISO granted under this Plan that does not qualify as an ISO for any reason (whether at the time of grant or as the result of a subsequent event) shall be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Option. In addition, any ISO granted under this Plan may be unilaterally modified by the Committee to disqualify such Stock Option from ISO treatment such that it shall become a Non-Qualified Option; provided, however, that any such modification shall be ineffective if it causes the Award to be subject to Code Section 409A (unless, as modified, the Award complies with Code Section 409A).
(b)      Restricted Stock Awards.  A Restricted Stock Award means a grant of shares of Stock under Section 2.3 for no consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan, subject to a vesting schedule. 
Section 2.2     Stock Options. 
(a)      Grant of Stock Options. Each Stock Option shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall: (i) specify the number of Stock Options covered by the Award; (ii) specify the date of grant of the Stock Option; (iii) specify the vesting period or conditions to vesting; (iv) the Exercise Price; and (v) contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, including the effect of termination of a Participant's employment or Service with the Company as the Committee may, in its discretion, prescribe.
(b)      Terms and Conditions. A Stock Option shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such periods as may be established by the Committee. In no event, however, shall a Stock Option expire later than ten (10) years after the date of its grant (or five (5) years with respect to ISOs granted to an Employee who is a 10% Stockholder).  The "Exercise Price" of each Stock Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant (or, if greater, the par value of a share of Stock); provided, however, that the Exercise Price of an ISO shall not be less than 110% of Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant if granted to a 10% Stockholder; provided further, that the Exercise Price may be higher or lower in the case of Stock Options granted or exchanged in replacement of existing Awards held by an Employee or Director of, or service provider to, an acquired entity. 
(c)     Method of Exercise. Subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, a Participant may exercise any Stock Option, to the extent such Stock Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company, provided, however, that in no event shall a Stock Option be exercisable for a fractional share. The date of exercise of a Stock Option shall be the later of: (i) the date on which the Company receives such written notice; and (ii) the date on which the Participant pays the applicable Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 2.2(c). The payment of the Exercise Price of a Stock Option shall be by cash or, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law, by such other means as the Committee may from time to time permit, including: (i) by tendering, either actually or constructively by attestation, shares of Stock valued at Fair Market Value as of the day of exercise; (ii) by irrevocably authorizing a third party, acceptable to the Committee, to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Stock Option and to remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise; (iii) by a net settlement of the Stock Option, using a portion of the shares obtained on exercise in payment of the Exercise Price of the Stock Option (and if applicable, any required tax withholding, to the extent permitted under the Plan); (iv) by personal, certified or cashier's check; (v) by other property deemed acceptable by the Committee; or (vi) by any combination thereof. The total number of shares that may be acquired upon the exercise of a Stock Option shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share, with cash-in-lieu paid by the Company, at its discretion, for the value of any fractional share.
(d)     Prohibition of Cash Buy-Outs of Underwater Stock Options. Under no circumstances will any underwater Stock Options which were granted under the Plan be bought back by the Company without stockholder approval.
Section 2.3     Restricted Stock.  
(a)      Grant of Restricted Stock. Each Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall: (i) specify the number of shares of Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Award; (ii) specify the date of grant of the Restricted Stock Award; (iii) specify the vesting period; and (iv) contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, including the effect of termination of a Participant's employment or Service with the Company. All Restricted Stock Awards shall be in the form of issued and outstanding shares of Stock that, at the discretion of the Committee, shall be either: (x) registered in the name of the Participant and held by or on behalf of the Company, together with a stock power executed by the Participant in favor of the Company, pending the vesting or forfeiture of the Restricted Stock; or (y) registered in the name of, and delivered to, the Participant. In any event, the certificates evidencing the Restricted Stock Award shall at all times prior to the applicable vesting date bear the following legend:
The Stock evidenced hereby is subject to the terms of an Award Agreement with FFBW, Inc. dated [Date], made pursuant to the terms of the FFBW, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, copies of which are on file at the executive offices of FFBW, Inc., and may not be sold, encumbered, hypothecated or otherwise transferred except in accordance with the terms of such Plan and Award Agreement, or such other restrictive legend as the Committee, in its discretion, may specify. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may in its sole discretion issue Restricted Stock in any other approved format (e.g., electronically) in order to facilitate the paperless transfer of such Awards. In the event Restricted Stock is not issued in certificate form, the Company and the transfer agent shall maintain appropriate bookkeeping entries that evidence Participants' ownership of such Awards. Restricted Stock that is not issued in certificate form shall be subject to the same terms and conditions of the Plan as certificated shares, including the restrictions on transferability and the provision of a stock power executed by the Participant in favor of the Company, until the satisfaction of the conditions to which the Restricted Stock Award is subject.
     (b)      Terms and Conditions.     Each Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
(i)      Dividends. Unless the Committee determines otherwise with respect to any Restricted Stock Award and specifies such determination in the relevant Award Agreement, any dividends or distributions declared and paid with respect to shares of Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award shall be immediately distributed to the Participant. If the Committee determines to delay the distribution of dividends to a Participant until the vesting of an Award of Restricted Stock, the Committee shall cause the dividend (and any earnings thereon) to be distributed to the Participant no later than two and one-half months following the date on which the Restricted Stock vests.    
(ii)      Voting Rights.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise with respect to any Restricted Stock Award and specifies such determination in the relevant Award Agreement, a Participant shall have voting rights related to the unvested, non-forfeited Restricted Stock and such voting rights shall be exercised by the Participant in his or her discretion.
(iii)      Tender Offers and Merger Elections. Each Participant to whom a Restricted Stock Award is granted shall have the right to respond, or to direct the response, with respect to the related shares of Restricted Stock, to any tender offer, exchange offer, cash/stock merger consideration election or other offer made to, or elections made by, the holders of shares of Stock. Such a direction for any such shares of Restricted Stock shall be given by proxy or ballot (if the Participant is the beneficial owner of the shares of Restricted Stock for voting purposes) or by completing and filing, with the inspector of elections, the trustee or such other person who shall be independent of the Company as the Committee shall designate in the direction (if the Participant is not such a beneficial owner), a written direction in the form and manner prescribed by the Committee. If no such direction is given, then the shares of Restricted Stock shall not be tendered.
(iv)     The conditions for grant or vesting and the other provisions of Restricted Stock Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
Section 2.4     Vesting of Awards. The Committee shall specify the vesting schedule or conditions of each Award. Unless the Committee specifies a different vesting schedule at the time of grant, Awards under the Plan awarded to an Employee shall be granted with a vesting rate not exceeding twenty percent (20%) per year, with the first installment vesting no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. Unless the Committee specifies a different vesting schedule at the time of grant, each Award granted to a Director shall fully vest on the one-year anniversary following the date on which the Award was granted. If the right to become vested in an Award under the Plan (including the right to exercise a Stock Option) is conditioned on the completion of a specified period of Service with the Company or its Subsidiaries, without it being granted in lieu of, or in exchange for, other compensation, then the required period of Service for full vesting shall be determined by the Committee and evidenced in the Award Agreement (subject to acceleration of vesting, to the extent permitted by the Committee or set forth in the Award Agreement, in the event of the Participant's death, Disability or Involuntary Termination following a Change in Control). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent specified in Section 4.1(c), at least ninety-five percent (95%) of all Awards under the Plan shall be subject to a vesting requirement of at least one year of Service following the grant of the Award unless accelerated due to death, Disability or Involuntary Termination following a Change in Control.
Section 2.5     Deferred Compensation. If any Award would be considered "deferred compensation" as defined under Code Section 409A ("Deferred Compensation"), the Committee reserves the absolute right (including the right to delegate such right) to unilaterally amend the Plan or the Award Agreement, without the consent of the Participant, to maintain exemption from, or to comply with, Code Section 409A. Any amendment by the Committee to the Plan or an Award Agreement pursuant to this Section shall maintain, to the extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without violating Code Section 409A. A Participant's acceptance of any Award under the Plan constitutes acknowledgement and consent to such rights of the Committee, without further consideration or action. Any discretionary authority retained by the Committee pursuant to the terms of this Plan or pursuant to an Award Agreement shall not be applicable to an Award which is determined to constitute Deferred Compensation, if such discretionary authority would contravene Code Section 409A.
Section 2.6     Prohibition Against Option Repricing.  Except for adjustments pursuant to Section 3.4, and reductions of the Exercise Price approved by the Company's stockholders, neither the Committee nor the Board shall have the right or authority to make any adjustment or amendment that reduces or would have the effect of reducing the Exercise Price of a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan, whether through amendment, cancellation (including cancellation in exchange for a cash payment in excess of the Stock Option's in-the-money value or in exchange for Options or other Awards) or replacement grants, or other means.
Section 2.7.     Effect of Termination of Service on Awards. The Committee shall establish the effect of a Termination of Service on the continuation of rights and benefits available under an Award and, in so doing, may make distinctions based upon, among other things, the cause of Termination of Service and type of Award. Unless otherwise specified by the Committee and set forth in an Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant or as set forth in an employment or severance agreement entered into by and between the Company and/or the Bank and an Employee, the following provisions shall apply to each Award granted under this Plan:
(a)     Upon a Participant's Termination of Service for any reason other than due to Disability, death, Retirement or termination for Cause, Stock Options shall be exercisable only as to those shares that were immediately exercisable by such Participant at the date of termination, and Stock Options may be exercised only for a period of three (3) months following termination and any Restricted Stock Award that has not vested as of the date of Termination of Service shall expire and be forfeited.
(b)     In the event of a Termination of Service for Cause, all Stock Options granted to a Participant that have not been exercised and all Restricted Stock Awards granted to a Participant that have not vested shall expire and be forfeited.
(c)     Upon Termination of Service for reason of Disability or death, all Stock Options shall be exercisable as to all shares subject to an outstanding Award, whether or not then exercisable, and all Restricted Stock Awards shall vest as to all shares subject to an outstanding Award, whether or not otherwise immediately vested, at the date of Termination of Service. Stock Options may be exercised for a period of one year following Termination of Service due to death or Disability or the remaining unexpired term of the Stock Option, if less; provided, however, that no Stock Option shall be eligible for treatment as an ISO in the event such Stock Option is exercised more than one year following Termination of Service due to Disability and provided, further, in order to obtain ISO treatment for Stock Options exercised by heirs or devisees of an optionee, the optionee's death must have occurred while employed or within three months of Termination of Service. In the event of Termination of Service due to Retirement, a Participant's vested Stock Options shall be exercisable for one year following Termination of Service, provided that no Stock Option shall be eligible for treatment as an ISO in the event such Stock Option is exercised more than three months following Termination of Service due to Retirement and any Stock Option or Restricted Stock Award that has not vested as of the date of Termination of Service shall expire and be forfeited.
(d)     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Stock Option shall be exercisable beyond the last day of the original term of such Stock Option.
(e)     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.7, the effect of a Change in Control on the vesting/exercisability of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards is as set forth in Article 4.
ARTICLE 3 - Shares Subject to Plan
Section 3.1     Available Shares.  The shares of Stock with respect to which Awards may be made under the Plan shall be shares currently authorized but unissued, currently held or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, subsequently acquired by the Company as treasury shares, including shares purchased in the open market or in private transactions.
Section 3.2     Share Limitations. 
(a)     Share Reserve. Subject to the following provisions of this Section 3.2, the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be delivered to Participants and their beneficiaries under the Plan shall be equal to 453,617 shares of Stock. The maximum number of shares of Stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options (all of which may be granted as ISOs) is Three Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Twelve (324,012) shares of Stock. The maximum number of shares of Stock that may be issued as Restricted Stock Awards is One Hundred Twenty-Nine Thousand Six Hundred Five (129,605) shares of Stock. The aggregate number of shares available for grant under this Plan and the number of shares of Stock subject to outstanding awards shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4.
(b)     Computation of Shares Available. For purposes of this Section 3.2, the number of shares of Stock available for the grant of additional Stock Options or Restricted Stock Awards shall be reduced by the number of shares of Stock previously granted, subject to the following: (i) to the extent any shares of Stock covered by an Award (including Restricted Stock Awards) under the Plan are not delivered to a Participant or beneficiary for any reason, including because the Award is forfeited or canceled or because a Stock Option is not exercised, then such shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Stock available for delivery under the Plan. To the extent: (i) a Stock Option is exercised by using an actual or constructive exchange of shares of Stock to pay the Exercise Price; or (ii) shares of Stock are withheld to satisfy withholding taxes upon exercise or vesting of an Award granted hereunder; or (iii) shares are withheld to satisfy the exercise price of Stock Options in a net settlement of Stock Options, then the number of shares of Stock available shall be reduced by the gross number of Stock Options exercised rather than by the net number of shares of Stock issued.
Section 3.3     Limitations on Grants to Employees and Directors.
(a)          Employee Awards.
(i)     Stock Options - Employees.  The maximum number of shares of Stock, in the aggregate, that may be covered by a Stock Option granted to any one Employee under the Plan shall be Eighty-One Thousand Three (81,003) shares, all of which may be granted during any calendar year. This maximum amount represents approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Stock Options under Section 3.2.
(ii)     Restricted Stock Awards - Employees. The maximum number of shares of Stock, in the aggregate, that may be subject to Restricted Stock Awards granted to any one Employee under the Plan shall be Thirty-Two Thousand Four Hundred One (32,401) shares, all of which may be granted during any calendar year. This maximum amount represents approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be issued as Restricted Stock Awards.
(b)          Director Awards. 
(i)     Stock Options – Aggregate Limit. Individual non-employee Directors may be granted Stock Options of up to Sixteen Thousand Two Hundred (16,200) shares, in the aggregate, all of which may be granted during any calendar year and, in addition, all non-employee Directors, in the aggregate, may be granted up to Ninety-Seven Thousand Two Hundred Three (97,203) shares all of which may be granted during any calendar year. These maximum amounts represent approximately five percent (5%) and thirty percent (30%), respectively, of the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Stock Options under Section 3.2.
(ii)      Restricted Stock Awards – Aggregate Limit. Individual non-employee Directors may be granted Restricted Stock Awards of up to Six Thousand Four Hundred Eighty (6,480) shares (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors may be granted up to Six Thousand Nine Hundred (6,900) shares), in the aggregate, all of which may be granted during any calendar year and, in addition, all non-employee Directors, in the aggregate, may be granted up to Thirty-Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty-One (38,881) shares all of which may be granted during any calendar year.

(iii)     Initial Grants to Non-Employee Directors. Each non-employee Director who is in the Service of the Company and/or a Subsidiary on the Effective Date (the date of the 2018 Company special stockholder meeting at which stockholders approve the Plan ("2018 Special Meeting") shall automatically be granted an Award of Stock Options and Restricted Stock as follows:
(A)     Stock Options – Non-Employee Directors. Each non-employee Director who is in the Service of the Company and/or Subsidiary immediately following the 2018 Special Meeting shall receive, on the Effective Date, a grant of Nine Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Seven (9,257) Stock Options (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall receive a grant of 13,886 stock options), and this amount represents approximately 3.53% and 5.30%, respectively, of the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Stock Options under Section 3.2. 
(B)      Restricted Stock Awards – Non-Employee Directors. Each non-employee Director who is in the Service of the Company and/or Subsidiary immediately following the 2018 Special Meeting shall receive, on the Effective Date, a grant of Four Thousand Five Hundred Seventy-Four (4,574) shares of Restricted Stock (except the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall receive a grant of 6,863 shares of Restricted Stock), and this amount represents approximately 3.53% and 5.30%, respectively, of the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Restricted Stock Awards under Section 3.2.
(c)     The aggregate number of shares available for grant under this Plan and the number of shares subject to outstanding Awards, including the limit on the number of Awards available for grant under this Plan described in this Section 3.3, shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4.
Section 3.4     Corporate Transactions. 
(a)     General. In the event any recapitalization, forward or reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares of Stock or other securities, stock dividend or other special and nonrecurring dividend or distribution (whether in the form of cash, securities or other property), liquidation, dissolution, or other similar corporate transaction or event, affects the shares of Stock such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants under the Plan and/or under any Award granted under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in an equitable manner, adjust any or all of: (i) the number and kind of securities deemed to be available thereafter for grants of Stock Options or Restricted Stock Awards in the aggregate to all Participants and individually to any one Participant; (ii) the number and kind of securities that may be delivered or deliverable in respect of outstanding Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards; and (iii) the Exercise Price of Stock Options. In addition, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards (including, without limitation, cancellation of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards in exchange for the in-the-money value, if any, of the vested portion thereof, or substitution or exchange of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards using stock of a successor or other entity) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence) affecting the Company or any parent or Subsidiary or the financial statements of the Company or any parent or Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
(b)     Merger in which Company is Not Surviving Entity. In the event of any merger, consolidation, or other business reorganization (including, but not limited to, a Change in Control) in which the Company is not the surviving entity, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at any time at or after grant and prior to the consummation of such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization, any Stock Options granted under the Plan which remain outstanding shall be converted into Stock Options to purchase voting common equity securities of the business entity which survives such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization having substantially the same terms and conditions as the outstanding Stock Options under this Plan and reflecting the same economic benefit (as measured by the difference between the aggregate Exercise Price and the value exchanged for outstanding shares of Stock in such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization), all as determined by the Committee prior to the consummation of such merger; provided, however, that the Committee may, at any time prior to the consummation of such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization, direct that all, but not less than all, outstanding Stock Options be canceled as of the effective date of such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization in exchange for a cash payment per share of Stock equal to the excess (if any) of the value exchanged for an outstanding share of Stock in such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization over the Exercise Price of the Stock Option being canceled; provided, further, that in the event the Exercise Price of outstanding Stock Options exceed the value to be exchanged for an outstanding share of Stock (an "Underwater Stock Option") in such merger, consolidation or other business reorganization, the Committee may, in its discretion, cancel and terminate such Underwater Stock Options without the consent of the holder of the Stock Option and without any payment to such holder.
Section 3.5     Delivery of Shares.  Delivery of shares of Stock or other amounts under the Plan shall be subject to the following:
(a)     Compliance with Applicable Laws.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to deliver any shares of Stock or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution complies with all applicable laws (including, the requirements of the Securities Act), and the applicable requirements of any Exchange or similar entity.
(b)     Certificates.  To the extent that the Plan provides for the issuance of shares of Stock, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any Exchange.
ARTICLE 4 - CHANGE IN CONTROL
Section 4.1     Consequence of a Change in Control. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.4 (relating to vesting and acceleration) and Section 3.4 (relating to the adjustment of shares), and except as otherwise provided in the Plan or as determined by the Committee and set forth in the terms of any Award Agreement or as set forth in an employment, change in control, or severance agreement entered into by and between the Company and/or the Bank and an Employee:
(a)     At the time of an Involuntary Termination at or following a Change in Control, all Stock Options then held by the Participant shall become fully earned and exercisable (subject to the expiration provisions otherwise applicable to the Stock Option). All Stock Options may be exercised for a period of one year following the Participant's Involuntary Termination, provided, however, that no Stock Option shall be eligible for treatment as an ISO in the event such Stock Option is exercised more than three (3) months following such Involuntary Termination. To the extent not specified herein or in the Award Agreement, the Committee shall have the discretion to determine the treatment of outstanding unvested Awards, provided, however, that any such Awards will be deemed earned and shall vest if not assumed by a successor entity.
(b)     At the time of an Involuntary Termination at or following a Change in Control, all Awards of Restricted Stock described in Section 2.1(b) shall become fully earned and vested immediately.
Section 4.2     Definition of Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Change in Control" shall mean the consummation by the Company or the Bank, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of any of the following:
(a)     Merger: The Company or the Bank merges into or consolidates with another entity, or merges another bank or corporation into the Company or the Bank, and as a result, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the resulting corporation immediately after the merger or consolidation is held by persons who were stockholders of the Company or the Bank immediately before the merger or consolidation;
(b)     Acquisition of Significant Share Ownership: A person or persons acting in concert has or have become the beneficial owner of 25% or more of a class of the Company's or the Bank's Voting Securities; provided, however, this clause (b) shall not apply to beneficial ownership of the Company's or the Bank's voting shares held in a fiduciary capacity by an entity of which the Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of its outstanding Voting Securities;
(c)     Change in Board Composition: During any period of two consecutive years, individuals who constitute the Company's or the Bank's Board of Directors at the beginning of the two-year period cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Company's or the Bank's Board of Directors; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (c), each director who is first elected by the board (or first nominated by the board for election by the stockholders) by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors who were directors at the beginning of the two-year period shall be deemed to have also been a director at the beginning of such period or who is appointed as a director as a result of a directive, supervisory agreement or order issued by the primary federal regulator of the Company or the Bank or by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall be deemed to have also been a director at the beginning of such period; or
(d)     Sale of Assets: The Company or the Bank sells to a third party all or substantially all of its assets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that an Award constitutes Deferred Compensation, and the settlement of, or distribution of benefits under, such Award is to be triggered solely by a Change in Control, then with respect to such Award, a Change in Control shall be defined as required under Code Section 409A, as in effect at the time of such transaction.
ARTICLE 5 - COMMITTEE
Section 5.1     Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the members of the Compensation Committee of the Company who are Disinterested Board Members. If the Committee consists of fewer than two Disinterested Board Members, then the Board shall appoint to the Committee such additional Disinterested Board Members as shall be necessary to provide for a Committee consisting of at least two Disinterested Board Members. Any members of the Committee who do not qualify as Disinterested Board Members shall abstain from participating in any discussion or decision to make or administer Awards that are made to Participants who at the time of consideration for such Award are persons subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Board (or if necessary to maintain compliance with the applicable listing standards, those members of the Board who are "independent directors" under the corporate governance statutes or rules of any national Exchange on which the Company lists, has listed or seeks to list its securities) may, in their discretion, take any action and exercise any power, privilege or discretion conferred on the Committee under the Plan with the same force and effect under the Plan as if done or exercised by the Committee.
Section 5.2     Powers of Committee.  The administration of the Plan by the Committee shall be subject to the following:
(a)     The Committee will have the authority and discretion to select from among the Company's and its Subsidiaries' Employees and Directors who shall receive Awards, to determine the time or times of receipt, to determine the types of Awards and the number of shares covered by the Awards, to establish the terms, conditions, features (including automatic exercise in accordance with Section 7.18 hereof), restrictions (including without limitation, provisions relating to non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality), and other provisions of such Awards (subject to the restrictions imposed by Article 6), to cancel or suspend Awards and to reduce, eliminate or accelerate any restrictions or vesting requirements applicable to an Award at any time after the grant of the Award or to extend the time period to exercise a Stock Option, provided that such extension is consistent with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee will not have the authority or discretion to accelerate the vesting requirements applicable to an Award to avoid the one-year minimum vesting requirement pursuant to Section 2.4 (except to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof).      
(b)     The Committee will have the authority and discretion to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
(c)     The Committee will have the authority to define terms not otherwise defined herein.
(d)     Any interpretation of the Plan by the Committee and any decision made by it under the Plan is final and binding on all persons.
(e)     In controlling and managing the operation and administration of the Plan, the Committee shall take action in a manner that conforms to the charter and bylaws of the Company and applicable corporate law.
(f)     The Committee will have the authority to: (i) suspend a Participant's right to exercise a Stock Option during a blackout period (or similar restricted period) or to exercise in a particular manner (i.e., such as a "cashless exercise" or "broker-assisted exercise") to the extent that the Committee deems it necessary or in the best interests of the Company in order to comply with the securities laws and regulations issued by the SEC (the "Blackout Period"); and (ii) to extend the period to exercise a Stock Option by a period of time equal to the Blackout Period, provided that such extension does not violate Section 409A of the Code, the Incentive Stock Option requirements or applicable laws and regulations.
Section 5.3     Delegation by Committee.  Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the applicable rules of an Exchange upon which the Company lists its shares or the Plan, or as necessary to comply with the exemptive provisions of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it, including: (a)  delegating to a committee of one or more members of the Board who are not "non-employee directors," within the meaning of Rule 16b-3, the authority to grant Awards under the Plan to eligible persons who are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act; (b) delegating to a committee of one or more members of the Board who would be eligible to serve on the Compensation Committee of the Company pursuant to the listing requirements imposed by any national securities exchange on which the Company lists, has listed or seeks to list its securities, the authority to grant awards under the Plan; or (c) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board or Committee may also appoint a committee, composed of one or more senior executive officers of the Company, that may authorize Awards to Employees (who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act) within parameters specified by the Board or Committee and consistent with any limitations imposed by applicable law, the Committee or the Board. The acts of such delegates shall be treated hereunder as acts of the Committee and such delegates shall report regularly to the Committee regarding the delegated duties and responsibilities and any Awards so granted. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
Section 5.4     Information to be Furnished to Committee.  As may be permitted by applicable law, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall furnish the Committee with such data and information as it determines may be required for it to discharge its duties.  The records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as to a Participant's employment, termination of employment, leave of absence, reemployment and compensation shall be conclusive on all persons unless determined by the Committee to be manifestly incorrect.  Subject to applicable law, Participants and other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the Plan.
Section 5.5     Committee Action. The Committee shall hold such meetings, and may make such administrative rules and regulations, as it may deem proper. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the action of a majority of the members of the Committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, as well as actions taken pursuant to the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the Committee without holding a meeting, shall be deemed to be actions of the Committee. Subject to Section 5.1, all actions of the Committee shall be final and conclusive and shall be binding upon the Company, Participants and all other interested parties. Any person dealing with the Committee shall be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, instruction, direction or other communication signed by a member of the Committee or by a representative of the Committee authorized to sign the same in its behalf.
ARTICLE 6 - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
Section 6.1     General.  The Board may, as permitted by law, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, and may amend any Award Agreement, provided that no amendment or termination (except as provided in Section 2.5, Section 3.4 and Section 6.2) may cause the Award to violate Code Section 409A, may cause the repricing of a Stock Option, or, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely impair the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board; provided, however, that, no amendment may (a) materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (b) materially increase the aggregate number of securities which may be issued under the Plan, other than pursuant to Section 3.4, or (c) materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan, unless the amendment under (a), (b) or (c) above is approved by the Company's stockholders.
Section 6.2     Amendment to Conform to Law and Accounting Changes.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may amend the Plan or any Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of: (i) conforming the Plan or the Award Agreement to any present or future law relating to plans of this or similar nature (including, but not limited to, Code Section 409A); or (ii) avoiding an accounting treatment resulting from an accounting pronouncement or interpretation thereof issued by the SEC or Financial Accounting Standards Board subsequent to the adoption of the Plan or the making of the Award affected thereby, which, in the sole discretion of the Committee, may materially and adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. By accepting an Award under this Plan, each Participant agrees and consents to any amendment made pursuant to this Section 6.2 or Section 2.5 to any Award granted under the Plan without further consideration or action.
ARTICLE 7 - GENERAL TERMS
Section 7.1     No Implied Rights.
(a)     No Rights to Specific Assets.  Neither a Participant nor any other person shall by reason of participation in the Plan acquire any right in or title to any assets, funds or property of the Company or any Subsidiary whatsoever, including any specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any Subsidiary, in its sole discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a liability under the Plan.  A Participant shall have only a contractual right to the shares of Stock or amounts, if any, payable or distributable under the Plan, unsecured by any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, and nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guarantee that the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person.
(b)     No Contractual Right to Employment or Future Awards.  The Plan does not constitute a contract of employment, and selection as a Participant will not give any participating Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or any right or claim to any benefit under the Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan.  No individual shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under the Plan, or, having been so selected, to receive a future Award under the Plan.
(c)     No Rights as a Stockholder. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in the Award Agreement, no Award under the Plan shall confer upon the holder thereof any rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the date on which the individual fulfills all conditions for receipt of such rights.
Section 7.2     Transferability.  Except as otherwise so provided by the Committee, ISOs under the Plan are not transferable except: (i) as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; (ii) to a trust established by the Participant, if under Code Section 671 and applicable state law, the Participant is considered the sole beneficial owner of the Stock Option while held in trust; or (iii) between spouses incident to a divorce or pursuant to a domestic relations order, provided, however, in the case of a transfer within the meaning of this paragraph (iii), the Stock Option shall not qualify as an ISO as of the day of such transfer. The Committee shall have the discretion to permit the transfer of vested Stock Options (other than ISOs) under the Plan; provided, however, that such transfers shall be limited to Immediate Family Members of Participants, trusts and partnerships established for the primary benefit of such family members or to charitable organizations, and; provided, further, that such transfers are not made for consideration to the Participant.
Awards of Restricted Stock shall not be transferable prior to the time that such Awards vest in the Participant.
Section 7.3     Designation of Beneficiaries.  A Participant hereunder may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries under this Plan and may from time to time revoke or amend any such designation ("Beneficiary Designation"). Any designation of beneficiary under this Plan shall be controlling over any other disposition, testamentary or otherwise (unless such disposition is pursuant to a domestic relations order); provided, however, that if the Committee is in doubt as to the entitlement of any such beneficiary to any Award, the Committee may determine to recognize only the legal representative of the Participant, in which case the Company, the Committee and the members thereof shall not be under any further liability to anyone.
Section 7.4     Non-Exclusivity.  Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of Restricted Stock Awards or Stock Options and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
Section 7.5     Award Agreement.  Each Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement signed by the Participant. A copy of the Award Agreement, in any medium chosen by the Committee, shall be provided (or made available electronically) to the Participant.
Section 7.6     Form and Time of Elections/Notification Under Code Section 83(b).  Unless otherwise specified herein, each election required or permitted to be made by any Participant or other person entitled to benefits under the Plan, and any permitted modification or revocation thereof, shall be filed with the Company at such times, in such form, and subject to such restrictions and limitations, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall require. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Committee may, on the date of grant or at a later date, as applicable, prohibit an individual from making an election under Code Section 83(b). If the Committee has not prohibited an individual from making this election, an individual who makes this election shall notify the Committee of the election within ten (10) days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service. This requirement is in addition to any filing and notification required under the regulations issued under the authority of Code Section 83(b).
Section 7.7     Evidence.  Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information upon which the person is acting considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties.
Section 7.8     Tax Withholding.  Where a Participant is entitled to receive shares of Stock upon the vesting or exercise of an Award, the Company shall have the right to require such Participant to pay to the Company the amount of any tax that the Company is required to withhold with respect to such vesting or exercise, or, in lieu thereof, to retain, or to sell without notice, a sufficient number of shares of Stock to cover the minimum amount required to be withheld. To the extent determined by the Committee, a Participant shall have the right to direct the Company to satisfy the minimum amount (or an amount up to a Participant's highest marginal tax rate provided such withholding does not trigger liability accounting under FASB ASC Topic 718 or its successor) required for federal, state and local tax withholding by: (i) with respect to a Stock Option, reducing the number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option (without issuance of such shares of Stock to the Stock Option holder) by a number equal to the quotient of (a) the total minimum amount of required tax withholding divided by (b) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the exercise date over the Exercise Price per share of Stock; and (ii) with respect to Restricted Stock Awards, withholding a number of shares (based on the Fair Market Value on the vesting date) otherwise vesting that would satisfy the minimum amount of required tax withholding (or an amount up to a Participant's highest marginal rate provided such withholding does not trigger liability accounting under FASB ASC Topic 718 or its successor). Provided there are no adverse accounting consequences to the Company (a requirement to have liability classification of an award under FASB ASC Topic 718 is an adverse consequence), a Participant who is not required to have taxes withheld may request to the Company to withhold in accordance with the preceding sentence as if the Award were subject to minimum tax withholding requirements or up to such Participant's highest marginal tax rate.
Section 7.9     Action by Company or Subsidiary.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be by resolution of its board of directors, or by action of one or more members of the Board (including a committee of the Board) who are duly authorized to act for the Board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of the Exchange on which the Company lists its securities) by a duly authorized officer of the Company or such Subsidiary.
Section 7.10     Successors.  All obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business, stock, and/or assets of the Company.
Section 7.11     Indemnification.  To the fullest extent permitted by law and the Company's governing documents, each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 5.3, or an Employee of the Company, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss (including amounts paid in settlement), cost, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute or regulation. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's charter or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. The foregoing right to indemnification shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, if required by applicable law, an advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such persons to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses.
Section 7.12     No Fractional Shares.  Unless otherwise permitted by the Committee, no fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated by rounding down.
Section 7.13     Governing Law.  The Plan, all Awards granted hereunder, and all actions taken in connection herewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin without reference to principles of conflict of laws, except as superseded by applicable federal law. The federal and state courts located in the State of Wisconsin, shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim, action, complaint or lawsuit brought under the terms of the Plan. By accepting any award under this Plan, each Participant and any other person claiming any rights under the Plan agrees to submit himself or herself and any legal action that the Participant brings under the Plan, to the sole jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication and resolution of any such disputes.
Section 7.14     Benefits Under Other Plans.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee or as set forth in a Qualified Retirement Plan, Awards to a Participant (including the grant and the receipt of benefits) under the Plan shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the Participant's benefits under, or contributions to, any Qualified Retirement Plan, non-qualified plan and any other benefit plans maintained by the Participant's employer. The term "Qualified Retirement Plan" means any plan of the Company or a Subsidiary that is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a).
Section 7.15     Validity.  If any provision of this Plan is determined to be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision has never been included herein.
Section 7.16     Notice.  Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, all written notices and all other written communications to the Company provided for in the Plan or in any Award Agreement, shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid (provided that international mail shall be sent via overnight or two-day delivery), or sent by facsimile, email or prepaid overnight courier to the Company at its principal executive office. Such notices, demands, claims and other communications shall be deemed given:
(a)     in the case of delivery by overnight service with guaranteed next day delivery, the next day or the day designated for delivery;
(b)     in the case of certified or registered U.S. mail, five (5) days after deposit in the U.S. mail; or
(c)     in the case of facsimile or email, the date upon which the transmitting party received confirmation of receipt; provided, however, that in no event shall any such communications be deemed to be given later than the date they are actually received, provided they are actually received.
In the event a communication is not received, it shall only be deemed received upon the showing of an original of the applicable receipt, registration or confirmation from the applicable delivery service. Communications that are to be delivered by U.S. mail or by overnight service to the Company shall be directed to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Award Agreement.
Section 7.17     Forfeiture Events.
(a)     The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting conditions of an Award. Such events include, but are not limited to, termination of employment for cause, termination of the Participant's provision of Services to the Company or any Subsidiary, violation of material Company or Subsidiary policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct of the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or any Subsidiary.
(b)     If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, any Participant who is subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or who is subject to clawback under Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.
In addition, Awards granted hereunder are subject to any clawback policy adopted by the Board from time to time.
Section 7.18     Automatic Exercise. In the sole discretion of the Committee exercised in accordance with Section 5.2(a) above, any Stock Options that are exercisable but unexercised as of the day immediately before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant may be automatically exercised, in accordance with procedures established for this purpose by the Committee, but only if the exercise price is less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on such date and the automatic exercise will result in the issuance of at least one (1) whole share of Stock to the Participant after payment of the exercise price and any applicable minimum tax withholding requirements. Payment of the exercise price and any applicable tax withholding requirements shall be made by a net settlement of the Stock Option whereby the number of shares of Stock to be issued upon exercise are reduced by a number of shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price and any applicable minimum tax withholding.
Section 7.19     Regulatory Requirements. The grant and settlement of Awards under this Plan shall be conditioned upon and subject to compliance with Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(k), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

To the extent that an Award hereunder is subject to Code Section 409A, "Disability" or "Disabled" shall mean that a Participant: (i) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months; or (ii) is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering Employees.

(jj)     "Termination of Service" means the first day occurring on or after a grant date on which the Participant ceases to be an Employee or Director (including a Director Emeritus or advisory director) of the Company or any Subsidiary, regardless of the reason for such cessation, subject to the following:
(i)     The Participant's cessation as an Employee shall not be deemed to occur by reason of the transfer of the Participant between the Company and a Subsidiary or between two Subsidiaries.
(ii)     The Participant's cessation as an Employee shall not be deemed to occur by reason of the Participant's being on a bona fide leave of absence from the Company or a Subsidiary approved by the Company or Subsidiary otherwise receiving the Participant's Services, provided such leave of absence does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long as the Employee retains a right to reemployment with the Company or Subsidiary under an applicable statute or by contract. For these purposes, a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Employee will return to perform Services for the Company or Subsidiary. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the Employee does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first day immediately following such six month period. For purposes of this sub-section, to the extent applicable, an Employee's leave of absence shall be interpreted by the Committee in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1).
(iii)     If, as a result of a sale or other transaction, the Subsidiary for whom Participant is employed (or to whom the Participant is providing Services) ceases to be a Subsidiary, and the Participant is not, following the transaction, an Employee of the Company or an entity that is then a Subsidiary, then the occurrence of such transaction shall be treated as the Participant's Termination of Service caused by the Participant being discharged by the entity for whom the Participant is employed or to whom the Participant is providing Services.
(iv)     Except to the extent Section 409A of the Code may be applicable to an Award, and subject to the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section, the Committee shall have discretion to determine if a Termination of Service has occurred and the date on which it occurred.  In the event that any Award under the Plan constitutes Deferred Compensation (as defined in Section 2.5 hereof), the term Termination of Service shall be interpreted by the Committee in a manner consistent with the definition of "Separation from Service" as defined under Code Section 409A and under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(ii). For purposes of this Plan, a "Separation from Service" shall have occurred if the Bank and Participant reasonably anticipate that no further Services will be performed by the Participant after the date of the Termination of Service (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) or the level of further Services performed will be less than 50% of the average level of bona fide Services in the 36 months immediately preceding the Termination of Service. If a Participant is a "Specified Employee," as defined in Code Section 409A and any payment to be made hereunder shall be determined to be subject to Code Section 409A, then if required by Code Section 409A, such payment or a portion of such payment (to the minimum extent possible) shall be delayed and shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month following Participant's Separation from Service.
(v)     With respect to a Participant who is a Director, cessation as a Director will not be deemed to have occurred if the Participant continues as a Director Emeritus or advisory director. With respect to a Participant who is both an Employee and a Director, termination of employment as an Employee shall not constitute a Termination of Service for purposes of the Plan so long as the Participant continues to provide Service as a Director, Director Emeritus or advisory director.
(kk)     "Voting Securities" means any securities which ordinarily possess the power to vote in the election of directors without the happening of any pre-condition or contingency.
Section 8.2     In this Plan, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the following uses apply:
(a)     actions permitted under this Plan may be taken at any time and from time to time in the actor's reasonable discretion;
(b)     references to a statute shall refer to the statute and any successor statute, and to all regulations promulgated under or implementing the statute or its successor, as in effect at the relevant time;
(c)     in computing periods from a specified date to a later specified date, the words "from" and "commencing on" (and the like) mean "from and including," and the words "to," "until" and "ending on" (and the like) mean "to, but excluding";
(d)     references to a governmental or quasi-governmental agency, authority or instrumentality shall also refer to a regulatory body that succeeds to the functions of the agency, authority or instrumentality;
(e)     indications of time of day mean Eastern Time;
(f)     "including" means "including, but not limited to";
(g)     all references to sections, schedules and exhibits are to sections, schedules and exhibits in or to this Plan unless otherwise specified;
(h)     all words used in this Plan will be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances and context require;
(i)     the captions and headings of articles, sections, schedules and exhibits appearing in or attached to this Plan have been inserted solely for convenience of reference and shall not be considered a part of this Plan nor shall any of them affect the meaning or interpretation of this Plan or any of its provisions;
(j)     any reference to a document or set of documents in this Plan, and the rights and obligations of the parties under any such documents, shall mean such document or documents as amended from time to time, and any and all modifications, extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements thereof; and
(k)     all accounting terms not specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
