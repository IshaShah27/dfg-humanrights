      A Message from Our Independent Chairman         
Dear Fellow Shareholder, 
At Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI), your board is committed to the highest standards of ethics and good corporate governance, promoting integrity, accountability, transparency and sound decision-making. As Chairman, I value this chance to share our board's priorities for achieving our objectives of creating long-term shareholder value and ensuring the vitality of HEI for all who rely on our company, from our shareholders and customers to our employees and the communities we serve. 
   Board Refreshment and Governance 
To support and advance our company's priorities, including our work to achieve Hawaii's leading renewable energy goals, we are focused on ensuring we have the right mix of directors with the collective expertise to guide our strategy. We are deeply committed to maintaining diverse perspectives, and 64% of our directors are women or from diverse ethnic backgrounds. We are excited to nominate three new directors for election to the board this year, two of whom are women and all of whom bring excellent skills and experience to add to the strength of our talented board. 
Celeste Connors has extensive experience developing policy on sustainability and climate change and bringing stakeholders together to address policy challenges. Mary Powell is the CEO of a utility known for its customer focus and innovative green energy initiatives. And Jim Scilacci has in-depth utility and financial expertise. As a board, we took great care in evaluating the needs of our company and assessing potential board candidates. We highly recommend Celeste, Mary and Jim to you, our shareholders, for election to the board. To learn more about them, please see pages 2-5 of this proxy statement. 
After 25 years of dedicated service to HEI's board, much of which as a valued chair of our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, Kelvin Taketa will not stand for re-election. We have appointed Peggy Fowler as the new Chair of our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee. In addition, as part of our planned board leadership transition, Admiral Tom Fargo, who serves as Chair of our Compensation Committee and has been nominated for re-election to the board, will be appointed Vice Chair of the Board if elected at this annual meeting. 
While this year reflects a number of changes in our board composition, board refreshment is a continuous process. We conduct annual board and committee self-evaluations and periodic self and peer reviews to ensure the board's skills align with our strategy. In addition to expertise in utilities and banking, our board has significant leadership experience and deep expertise in regulation, renewable energy, infrastructure resilience, risk management, financial oversight, strategic and operational management of complex organizations and corporate transformation. With our operations and strategy focused on Hawaii, our success is inextricably linked to the health of Hawaii's economy and communities. Thus, it is critically important to have directors who are connected to and understand our communities and the unique regulatory and community considerations of operating in our islands. Finally, our board continues to prioritize diversity and independence, which encourage the constructive expression of views that may differ from those of senior management, particularly in setting our strategic direction. 
   Board Oversight of Strategy and Capital Allocation 
The board meets regularly to assess HEI's strategy, including the development and investment in opportunities that serve as catalysts for a better Hawaii. Our place-based strategy and sustained financial performance provide the resources to invest in the company's strategic growth and a sustainable future for our state, while delivering shareholder value. Our strong investment grade balance sheet provides efficient access to growth capital and our consolidated enterprise and efficient capital structure limit our need for external equity. Over the last five years, we have invested $2 billion in Hawaii infrastructure, loaned $7.8 billion to Hawaii customers and returned approximately

$600 million in dividends to shareholders. In addition, our total return to shareholders has outperformed both the S&P 500 and broader utility index over one-, three- and five-year periods. 
   Culture and Our Teammates 
We are dedicated to creating a better Hawaii. We reflect this commitment through our efforts to provide products and services that enhance our customers' lives, and in our work to protect Hawaii's unique environment, strengthen our economy, support our communities and act with integrity and accountability. 
Our board oversees and works with management to find and cultivate the talent our organization needs to continue delivering value for our shareholders, customers and communities. Our employees are committed to the company's foundational values: integrity, excellence, aloha and safety. In turn, we as a board have prioritized investment in our employees, providing opportunities for challenge, growth and advancement. We offer numerous training courses and extensive wellness programs focusing on improving overall employee health across the enterprise. I'm pleased to announce that American Savings Bank continues to receive recognition for its excellent workplace culture, and has been named one of Hawaii Business Magazine's "Best Places to Work" for ten consecutive years. 
   Our Focus on Risk Oversight 
The board spends significant time on risk oversight. We have a board-approved consolidated enterprise risk management system designed to identify and assess risks across the HEI enterprise and report risks to the board, along with proposed strategies for mitigating such risks. 
At least annually, the board conducts a strategic planning and risk review, during which we evaluate the company's fundamental financial and business strategies and assess major risks facing the company and options to mitigate those risks. Based on the review, the board and senior management, including the HEI Chief Risk Officer, identify key issues to be addressed during the next calendar year. 
   Meaningful Shareholder Engagement 
We believe strong corporate governance includes engaging with our shareholders and considering their views. Over the past year, our company reached out to or engaged in meetings and discussions with shareholders representing more than 65% of our institutional shareholder base. These meetings covered our financial and operational performance, our progress toward renewable energy goals, executive compensation and board and governance policies, and involved our independent directors as appropriate. This engagement provides valuable insight that informs the work of both management and the board. 
We look forward to the year ahead as we continue our work to create long-term shareholder, customer and community value. On behalf of the Board of Directors, thank you for your continued support. 
Aloha, 
Jeffrey N. Watanabe  Chairman of the Board

The lack of a check for a particular item does not mean that the director does not possess that experience or is unable to contribute to the decision-making process in that area. We look to each director to be knowledgeable in these areas; however, the check indicates that the item is a particularly prominent area of expertise that the director brings to the Board. 
   SHAREHOLDER  INTERESTS

   2018 COMPANY  HIGHLIGHTS 
Creating long-term value for shareholders, customers, employees and communities 
In 2018, our HEI family of companies achieved important accomplishments that advance our goal of delivering long-term value for our shareholders, customers, employees and communities. We continued to work in collaboration with the communities we serve to reach our ambitious but necessary renewable energy goals, strengthen our economy and make our communities and neighborhoods more resilient. 
We delivered on key priorities of our five-year utility transformation plan, including (1) achieving 27 percent of energy sales from renewable sources — up from just 9 percent a decade ago and despite the lava-related outage of a third party geothermal plant in 2018; (2) contracting for the addition of eight new solar-plus-storage projects comprising 275 megawatts of solar and more than one gigawatt of battery storage, all at prices below the cost of fossil fuel generation; (3) a 19% reduction in imported fossil fuel use over the last 10 years, helping keep more dollars in our state's economy; (4) 19% lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from our facilities since 2010, with an expectation that over the next four years GHG emissions from our power plants will be cut in half, moving our state closer to a carbon neutral future; (5) the filing of our electrification of transportation roadmap to advance adoption of electric vehicles in our state; (6) continued work to modernize our grid, strengthen resilience and enable more renewable energy and more customer options; (7) a 17% improvement in customer satisfaction since 2014; and (8) implementation of a new enterprise management system, which is key to completing our One Company initiative to standardize processes across our system and bring more efficiency and value for customers. 
Our bank continues to carry out its vision of enabling Hawaii's families, businesses and communities to achieve their goals. ASB invested approximately $1.8 billion in our community in 2018. Its lending activities in Hawaii help build a sustainable local economy and provide the capital to help our customers grow their businesses, plan for retirement and their children's education, or buy their first home. ASB also achieved record financial performance in 2018, with net income of $82.5 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. Additionally, the new Honolulu campus that ASB's non-branch employees are moving into this spring provides opportunities to further the bank's efforts to make banking easier for customers, deepen customer relationships, increase efficiency and enhance the bank's award-winning culture. 
In 2018, our newest subsidiary, Pacific Current, continued to strengthen our strategy to be a catalyst for a better Hawai'i by building local partnerships to invest in projects that advance our state's sustainability goals. Pacific Current progressed development of solar-plus-storage projects at five University of Hawai'i campuses to help the university achieve its goal of net zero energy by 2035. In 2018, Pacific Current also established a small and highly talented management team, which includes its new President, Scott Valentino. 
Together our companies generated $201.8 million in net income in 2018, representing solid growth of 22% in both net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) over 2017, or 12% growth over the prior year's core net income and EPS, which excluded one-time tax reform impacts that reduced our 2017 earnings. In 2018 we continued our record of paying uninterrupted dividends to our shareholders and in early 2019 our board approved a 3% dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend from 31 cents to 32 cents per share and reflecting the strength of our 2018 results and our Board's confidence in our future prospects.

   PROXY SUMMARY    
   SUSTAINABILITY         
As a company with a strategy focused on Hawaii and with all of our operations in the state, our ability to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders is tied to the strength and long-term sustainability of Hawaii's communities, economy and environment. This is why our overall strategy is to be a catalyst for a better Hawaii and why our Board and management team are focused on collaborating with our communities to further a sustainable future for our state. 
Advancing a sustainable environment 
Hawaii has the nation's most ambitious climate goals: 100% renewable energy and a carbon neutral economy, including transportation, by 2045, and our companies are critical to accomplishing these goals. Our utility is on track to achieve our state's aggressive renewable energy standard, and is playing a leading role alongside other community partners to increase electrification of transportation to help make our state's economy carbon neutral. Significantly reducing the use of imported fossil fuel in our state will benefit our customers, economy and environment, and we believe will also drive long-term shareholder value as we invest in these efforts. Such benefits include more stable customer bills, more dollars retained in our local economy, increased resiliency for our state, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. These actions will help preserve Hawaii's unique environment, which is key to our economy given the importance of the tourism industry in Hawaii. As we continue our clean energy transition, we are seeking ways to increase efficiency and deliver even more benefits to our customers and shareholders. 
The actions we take today will help us achieve our long-term goals. Those actions include: 
Building a sustainable economy 
Our companies are key contributors to Hawaii's economy, and the health of our economy in turn impacts our companies. As a bank entirely focused on Hawaii, ASB is committed to building a sustainable local economy through its business lending activities and through its efforts to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. ASB loaned more than $7.8 billion to Hawaii customers over the past five years, including lending for small businesses, clean energy projects, community development and low income housing. This important financing helps diversify our economy and create new jobs, advance our state's move to a renewable energy, carbon neutral future, and helps provide a more stable foundation for Hawaii families. In addition, ASB works to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in our economy by sponsoring and participating in innovation and entrepreneurship programs, including its own "KeikiCo" business plan competition for K-12 students, university programs such as the University of Hawaii Pacific and Asian Center for Entrepreneurship and Chaminade University's Hogan Entrepreneurs Program, and nationally recognized start-up accelerators like XLR8UH and Elemental Excelerator.

   PROXY SUMMARY   
   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  HIGHLIGHTS — PAYING FOR PERFORMANCE         
The compensation program for our named executive officers is composed of four primary elements — base salary, performance-based annual and long-term incentives, and restricted stock units vesting in equal annual installments over four years. We emphasize variable pay over fixed pay, with the majority of the total compensation opportunity at target for each named executive officer linked to the Company's financial, market and operational results. The compensation program also balances the importance of achieving long-term strategic priorities and critical short-term goals linked to long-term objectives. 
   VARIABLE PAY REFLECTS  PERFORMANCE 
Under our pay-for-performance design, incentive payouts to named executive officers are aligned with results. The following graphs show the performance-based payouts to the HEI Chief Executive Officer (CEO). HEI CEO annual incentive pay is linked to HEI's adjusted annual net income, as well as subsidiary performance. Long-term performance-vesting equity payouts over the respective three-year periods tracked our Relative TSR results. 
   SUMMARY COMPENSATION  TABLE 
Due to the NextEra Energy merger that was pending at the time the 2015-17 and 2016-18 long term incentive plans (LTIPs) were established, these two LTIPs were denominated in cash rather than in stock. This is because the Compensation Committee had determined that while the merger was pending, HEI's stock price might be affected at least in part by merger considerations that were unrelated to HEI's true operating performance and that, as a result, the compensatory goals of the LTIP would be better served without such merger impact. Following the termination of the HEI/NextEra Energy merger agreement in July 2016, HEI returned to exclusively equity-based LTIPs in 2017, which impacts the comparative compensation amounts disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table (SCT). Although our LTIP programs and practices have not changed (i.e., one 3-year LTIP is granted each year), due to the disclosure timing differences between cash-based and equity-based LTIPs, the reported compensation amounts in the SCT for 2018 and 2017 are notably higher than, and not comparable to, the reported amounts for 2016 as they contain two LTIPs because of the disclosure differences, and are not reflective of the target compensation provided to our NEOs for 2018 and 2017. Due to SEC disclosure rules, the 2018 and 2017 compensation amounts in the SCT include both the 2015-2017 LTIP and 2016-18 LTIP respective cash payouts and the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 respectiveequity-based LTIP. By contrast, the 2016 compensation amounts in the SCT do not include any LTIP amounts. Please see page 50 under "Summary Compensation Table".

   PROXY SUMMARY   
   COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DECISION-MAKING         
The Compensation Committee, all of whose members are independent directors, establishes pay programs and reviews performance results to ensure that executive officer compensation aligns with shareholder interests. In addition, the Compensation Committee is advised by an independent compensation consultant with respect to the design of the plans, performance results, reasonableness of pay decisions and appropriateness or reasonableness of compensation adjustments. 
The Compensation Committee believes that executive officer compensation reflects favorably on the Company's pay-for-performance objective, is aligned with shareholder interests and compares well relative to the Company's peers.

HEI's corporate governance documents (such as the charters for the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Executive Committees, Corporate Governance Guidelines and Corporate Code of Conduct, as well as other governance documents) are available on HEI's website at  www.hei.com/govdocs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     The Board's leadership structure   
[END TABLE]
Since 2006, Mr. Watanabe has served as the nonexecutive Chairman of the Board and Ms. Lau has served as HEI's President and CEO. Since that time, Ms. Lau has also been the only employee director on the Board. 
Mr. Watanabe has never been employed by HEI or any HEI subsidiary. The Board has determined that he is independent. Among the many skills and qualifications that Mr. Watanabe brings to the Board, the Board considered: (i) his extensive experience in corporate and nonprofit governance from serving on other public company, private company and nonprofit boards; (ii) his reputation for effective consensus and relationship building and business and community leadership, including leadership of his former law firm; (iii) his willingness to spend time advising and mentoring members of HEI's senior management; and (iv) his dedication to committing the hard work and time necessary to successfully lead the Board. 
As HEI's Chairman, Mr. Watanabe's key responsibilities are to:
The Board's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the Chairman and CEO positions are held by the same person, or if the Board determines that the Chairman is not independent, the independent directors should designate an independent director to serve as "Lead Director." If a Lead Director is designated, the Lead Director's responsibilities are to: (i) preside at Board and shareholder meetings when the Chairman is not present, (ii) preside at executive sessions of the independent directors, (iii) facilitate communication between the independent directors and the Chairman or the Board as a whole, (iv) call meetings of the non-management or independent directors in executive session, (v) participate in approving meeting agendas, schedules and materials for the Board and (vi) perform other functions described in the Corporate Governance  Table of Contents
   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE    
Guidelines or as determined by the Board from time to time. 
The Board believes that its current leadership structure, which provides for an independent nonemployee Chairman, or an independent Lead Director if the Chairman is not independent, is appropriate and effective in light of HEI's current operations, strategic plans and overall corporate governance structure. Several reasons support this conclusion. First, the Board believes that having an independent Chairman or Lead Director has been important in establishing a tone at the top for both the Board and the Company that encourages constructive expression of views that differ from those of senior management. Second, the Board believes that the presence of an independent Chairman or Lead Director demonstrates to the Company's regulators and shareholders that the Board is committed to serving the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and not the best interests of management. Third, the Board recognizes that HEI has an uncommon corporate governance structure in that the boards of its two primary operating subsidiaries are also composed mostly of nonemployee directors and that the HEI Chairman plays an important leadership role at these subsidiary boards. For instance, in addition to chairing executive sessions of the nonemployee directors and attending meetings of the committees of these subsidiary boards, the Chairman leads each subsidiary board in conducting its annual performance self-evaluation and facilitates communications between the Board and each of these boards and management of the respective subsidiary company. We recently created the position of vice-chairman. In the absence of the chairman of the board, the vice-chairman presides at meetings of our shareholders and of our board of directors, and has the additional powers and duties assigned to the vice-chairman from time to time by the board of directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     The Board's role in risk oversight   
[END TABLE]
HEI is a holding company that operates principally through its Hawaii-based electric public utility and bank subsidiaries. At the holding company and subsidiary levels, the Company faces a variety of risks, including operational risks, regulatory and legal compliance risks, credit and interest rate risks, competitive risks, liquidity risks, cybersecurity risks, strategic, reputational and sustainability related risks. Developing and implementing strategies to manage these risks is the responsibility of management, and that responsibility is carried out by assignments of responsibility to various officers and other employees of the Company under the direction of HEI's Chief Financial Officer, who also serves as HEI's Chief Risk Officer. The role of the Board is to oversee the management of these risks. 
The Board's specific risk oversight functions are as follows: Table of Contents
   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
guidelines and policies governing the process by which risk assessment and risk management are undertaken at the Company, and to report to the Board the committee's discussion and findings so that the entire Board can consider changes (if any) in the Company's risk profile. 
The Board believes that, for risk oversight, it is especially important to have an independent Chairman or Lead Director in order to ensure that differing views from those of management are expressed. Since the HEI Chairman attends the meetings of the Board, the subsidiary boards and their respective committees, the HEI Chairman is also in a unique position to assist with communications regarding risk oversight and risk management among the Board and its committees, between the subsidiary boards and their respective committees and between directors and management.  Table of Contents

[BEGIN TABLE]
     Selection of nominees for the Board   
[END TABLE]
A key role of the Board is to ensure that it has the skills, expertise and attributes needed in light of the company's strategy, challenges and opportunities. The Board believes that there are skill sets, qualities and attributes that should be represented on the Board as a whole but do not necessarily need to be possessed by each director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board thus consider the qualifications and attributes of incumbent directors and director candidates both individually and in the aggregate in light of the current and future needs of HEI and its subsidiaries. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in identifying and evaluating persons for nomination or re-nomination for Board service or to fill a vacancy on the Board. To identify qualified candidates for HEI Board membership, the Committee may consider persons who are serving on its subsidiary boards as well as persons suggested by Board members, management and shareholders or may retain a third-party search firm to help identify qualified candidates. The Committee's evaluation process does not vary based on whether a candidate is recommended by a shareholder, a Board member, a member of management or self-nomination. 
Once a person is identified as a potential director candidate, the committee may review publicly available information to assess whether the candidate should be further considered. If so, a committee member or designated representative for the committee will contact the person. If the person is willing to be considered for nomination, the person is asked to provide additional information regarding his or her background, his or her specific skills, experience and qualifications for Board service, and any direct or indirect relationships with the Company. In addition, one or more interviews may be conducted with committee and Board members, and committee members may contact one or more references provided by the candidate or others who would have first-hand knowledge of the candidate's qualifications and attributes. 
In evaluating the qualifications and attributes of each potential candidate (including incumbent directors) for nomination or re-nomination or appointment to fill a vacancy, the committee considers:
The Board considers the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and then makes the final decision whether to renominate incumbent directors and whether to approve and extend an invitation to a candidate to join the Board upon appointment or election, subject to any approvals required by law, rule or regulation. Ms. Connors was recommended for consideration to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by an executive officer, Ms. Powell was recommended by a shareholder and Mr. Scilacci was a referral from a former executive officer and the Company's financial advisor.

   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Diversity in identifying nominees for the Board   
[END TABLE]
In assisting the Board in identifying qualified director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers whether the candidate would contribute to the expertise, skills and professional experience, as well as to the diversity of the Board in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, age, geography and cultural background. The Board believes it functions most effectively with members who collectively possess a range of substantive expertise, skills and experience in areas that are relevant to leading HEI in accordance with the Board's fiduciary responsibilities. The Board also believes that having a board composed of members who can collectively contribute a range of perspectives, including perspectives that may arise from a person's gender or ethnicity, improves the quality of the Board's deliberations and decisions because it enables the Board to view issues from a variety of perspectives and, thus, more thoroughly and completely. As the Company's operations and strategic plans and the Board's composition may evolve over time, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is charged with identifying and assessing the appropriate mix of knowledge areas, qualifications and personal attributes contributed by Board members that will bring the most strategic and decision-making advantage to HEI. 
With operations almost exclusively in the State of Hawaii, it is advantageous that our Board include members who live and work in the state and have firsthand knowledge of and experience with our customer base and the political and regulatory environment. The Board benefits from the unique racial diversity that exists in Hawaii. If the shareholders vote to elect the five director nominees proposed by the Board for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting, the resulting composition of the Board would be as follows: seven directors (or 63.6%) who are Caucasian, three directors (or 27.3%) who are Asian American and one director (or 9.1%) who is Caucasian, Asian American and native Hawaiian. Four (or 36.4%) of the eleven directors would be female. 
The Board also recognizes that, due to Hawaii's geographic isolation from the continental United States and the comparatively small number of publicly-traded companies, banks and regulated utilities based in Hawaii, the Board also benefits from having among its members directors who have gained business experience at companies located in other states; those Board members contribute valuable information about experiences they have had working at or serving on the boards of other public companies and companies in similar industries, which also contributes to the breadth of perspectives on the Board. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Director resignation policies   
[END TABLE]
Through its Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board requires its members to submit a letter of resignation for consideration by the Board in certain circumstances. A director must tender his or her resignation in the event of a significant change in the director's principal employment and at the end of the term during which the director reaches age 75. In addition to the evaluation process discussed on page 16, requiring a director to submit a letter of resignation in these two circumstances ensures that the Board examines whether a director's skills, expertise and attributes continue to provide value over time. The Board has waived the resignation requirement for Mr. Watanabe upon reaching the age of 75 as part of its ongoing governance planning and to assure a smooth transition as the Board makes significant changes in its composition and leadership. 
A director must also submit his or her resignation for consideration by the Board if the director is elected under the plurality vote standard (described on page 74) but does not receive the support of the majority of votes cast. In such an event, the Board will evaluate the reasons for the voting result and determine how best to address the shareholder concerns underlying that result. In some cases, the Board may decide that the best approach is to accept the director's resignation. In other cases, the Board may discover that a shareholder concern that was the cause of the vote outcome may more appropriately be addressed by taking other action.  Table of Contents

     The Board's role in management succession planning   
[END TABLE]
The Board, led by its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, is actively engaged in succession planning and talent development, with a focus on the CEO and senior management of HEI and its operating subsidiaries. The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consider talent development programs and succession candidates through the lens of Company strategy and anticipated future opportunities and challenges. At its meetings throughout the year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews progress of talent development and succession programs and discusses internal and external succession candidates, including their capabilities, accomplishments, goals and development plans. The full Board also reviews and discusses talent strategy and evaluations of potential succession candidates at an annual Board retreat. In addition, potential leaders are given frequent exposure to the Board through formal presentations and informal events. These reviews, presentations and other interactions familiarize the Board with the Company's talent pool to enable the Board to select successors for the senior executive positions when appropriate.

     Shareholder communication with the directors   
[END TABLE]
Interested parties, including shareholders, desiring to communicate with the Board, any individual director or the independent directors as a group regarding matters pertaining to the business or operations of HEI may address their correspondence in care of the Corporate Secretary, Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc., P.O. Box 730, Honolulu, HI 96808-0730. The HEI Corporate Secretary may review, sort and summarize all such correspondence in order to facilitate communications to the Board. In addition, the HEI Corporate Secretary has the authority and discretion to handle any director communication that is an ordinary course of business matter, including routine questions, complaints, comments and related communications that can appropriately be handled by management. Directors may at any time request copies of all correspondence addressed to them. The charter of the HEI Audit Committee, which is available for review at  www.hei.com/govdocs, sets forth procedures for submitting complaints or concerns regarding financial statement disclosures, accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters on a confidential, anonymous basis.

     Independent directors   
[END TABLE]
Under HEI's Corporate Governance Guidelines, a majority of Board members must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the NYSE and any additional requirements as determined by the Board from time to time. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board considered the relationships described below in assessing the independence of Board members. Based on its consideration of such relationships and the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board determined that all of the nonemployee directors and director nominees of HEI (Messrs. Dahl, Fargo, Russell, Scilacci, Scott, Taniguchi and Watanabe and Mss. Connors, Fowler and Powell) are independent. The remaining director, Ms. Lau, is an employee director of HEI and therefore is not independent. 
      Relationships considered in determining director independence:       
With respect to Messrs. Scott, Taniguchi and Watanabe, the Board considered amounts paid in the last three fiscal years to purchase electricity from HEI subsidiaries Hawaiian Electric or Hawaii Electric Light (the sole public utilities providing electricity to the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, respectively) by entities employing these directors or where a family member of the director was an executive officer. None of the amounts paid by these entities for electricity (excluding pass-through charges for fuel, purchased power and Hawaii state revenue taxes) exceeded the thresholds in the NYSE listing standards or HEI Categorical Standards that would automatically result in a director not being independent. Since Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light are the sole sources of electric power on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, respectively, the rates they charge for electricity are fixed by state regulatory authority and purchasers of electricity from these public utilities have no choice as to supplier and no ability to negotiate rates or other terms, the Board determined that these relationships do not impair the independence of these directors. 
With respect to Dr. Scott, the Board considered charitable contributions in the last three fiscal years from HEI and its subsidiaries to the nonprofit organization where he serves as an executive officer. None of the contributions exceeded the threshold in the HEI Categorical Standards that would automatically result in Dr. Scott not being independent. In determining that these donations did not impair the independence of Dr. Scott, the Board also considered the fact that Company policy requires that charitable contributions from HEI or its subsidiaries to entities where an HEI director serves as an executive officer, and where the director has a direct or indirect material interest, and the aggregate amount donated by HEI and its subsidiaries to such organization would exceed $120,000 in any  Table of Contents
   BOARD OF DIRECTORS

With respect to Messrs. Fargo, Scott, Taniguchi and Watanabe, the Board considered other director or officer positions held by those directors at entities for which an HEI executive officer serves as a director or trustee and determined that none of these relationships affected the independence of these directors. None of these relationships resulted in a compensation committee interlock or would automatically preclude independence under the NYSE listing standards or HEI Categorical Standards.

     Functions of the Board's standing committees   
[END TABLE]
The primary functions of HEI's standing committees are described below. Each committee operates and acts under written charters that are approved by the Board and available for review on HEI's website at www.hei.com/govdocs. Each of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees may form subcommittees of its members and delegate authority to its subcommittees. 
      Audit Committee       
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing (i) HEI's financial reporting processes and internal controls, (ii) the performance of HEI's internal auditor, (iii) risk assessment and risk management policies set by management and (iv) the Corporate Code of Conduct compliance program for HEI and its subsidiaries. In addition, this committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm that audits HEI's consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee operates and acts under a written charter, which was adopted and approved by the Board and is available for review at www.hei.com/govdocs. The Audit Committee also maintains procedures for receiving and reviewing confidential reports of potential accounting and auditing concerns. See "Audit Committee Report" below for additional information about the Audit Committee. 
All Audit Committee members are independent and qualified to serve on the committee pursuant to NYSE and SEC requirements and the Audit Committee meets the other applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Mr. Dahl currently serves on the audit committees of Dine Brands Global, Inc. fka DineEquity, Inc. (NYSE: DIN), IDACORP, Inc. (NYSE: IDA), IDACORP's wholly-owned subsidiary, Idaho Power Company, and HEI's wholly-owned subsidiary Hawaiian Electric. The HEI Board has determined that Mr. Dahl's simultaneous service on the other audit committees would not impair his ability to effectively serve on its Audit Committee. None of the other Audit Committee members serve on the audit committees of more than two other public companies.  Table of Contents
   COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD   
HEI's primary operating subsidiaries, Hawaiian Electric and ASB, are responsible for overseeing risks at their respective companies. The Hawaiian Electric Board has assigned responsibility for ongoing oversight of risk management to its Audit Committee. The ASB Board has assigned responsibility for financial and reporting risk management to its Audit Committee and for all other risks to its Risk Committee. The HEI Board and/or Audit Committee may also be invited to participate in risk oversight discussions by these subsidiary boards and/or committees. The information from these subsidiary board and committee sessions are reported, on at least a quarterly basis, to the HEI Board by the subsidiary Chief Risk Officers (or their representatives), who functionally report to HEI's Chief Risk Officer on risk management matters. 
      Compensation Committee       
The responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include (i) overseeing the compensation plans and programs for employees, executives and nonemployee directors of HEI and its subsidiaries, including equity and incentive plans; (ii) reviewing the extent to which risks that may arise from the Company's compensation policies and practices, if any, may have a material adverse effect on the Company and recommending changes to address any such risks; (iii) evaluating the compliance of ASB's incentive compensation practices under the principles for sound incentive compensation plans for banking organizations and (iv) assessing the independence of any compensation consultant involved in determining or recommending director or executive compensation. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — How We Make Compensation Decisions" and "Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation" below for additional information about the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee operates and acts under a written charter, which was adopted and approved by the Board and is available for review at www.hei.com/govdocs. All Compensation Committee members are independent and qualified to serve on this committee pursuant to NYSE requirements and also qualify as "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and as "nonemployee directors" as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An independent member of the board of directors of each of Hawaiian Electric and ASB attends meetings of the Compensation Committee as a nonvoting representative of such director's subsidiary board. 
      Executive Committee       
The Executive Committee may exercise the power and authority of the Board when it appears to its members that action is necessary and a meeting of the full Board is impractical. It may also consider other matters concerning HEI that may arise from time to time between Board meetings. The Executive Committee is currently composed of the Chairman of the Board, who chairs the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee Chair and the HEI President and CEO. The Executive Committee operates and acts under a written charter, which was adopted and approved by the Board and is available for review at www.hei.com/govdocs. 
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee       
The functions of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee include (i) evaluating the background and qualifications of potential nominees for the Board and for the boards of HEI's subsidiaries, (ii) recommending to the Board the director nominees to be submitted to shareholders for election at the next Annual Meeting, (iii) assessing the independence of directors and nominees, (iv) recommending the slate of executive officers to be appointed by the Board and subsidiary boards, (v) advising the Board with respect to matters of Board and committee composition and procedures, (vi) overseeing the annual evaluation of the Board, its committees and director nominees, (vii) overseeing talent development and succession planning for senior executive positions and (viii) making recommendations to the Board and the boards of HEI's subsidiaries regarding corporate governance and board succession planning matters. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates and acts under a written charter, which was adopted and approved by the Board and is available for review at www.hei.com/govdocs.

[BEGIN TABLE]
     How director compensation is determined   
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that a competitive compensation package is necessary to attract and retain individuals with the experience, skills and qualifications needed to serve as a director of a publicly traded company with a unique blend of highly regulated industries. Nonemployee director compensation is composed of a mix of cash and HEI Common Stock to align the interests of directors with those of HEI shareholders. Only nonemployee directors are compensated for their service as directors. Ms. Lau, the only employee director of HEI, does not receive separate or additional compensation for serving as a director. Although Ms. Lau is a member of the HEI Board, neither she nor any other executive officer participates in the determination of nonemployee director compensation. 
The Compensation Committee reviews nonemployee director compensation at least once every three years and recommends changes to the Board. In 2018, the HEI Compensation Committee asked its independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), to conduct an evaluation of HEI's nonemployee director compensation practices. FW Cook assessed the structure of HEI's nonemployee director compensation program and its value compared to competitive market practices of utility peer companies, similar to the assessments used in its executive compensation review. The 2018 analysis took into consideration the duties and scope of responsibilities of directors. The HEI Compensation Committee reviewed the analysis in determining its recommendations concerning the appropriate nonemployee director compensation, including cash retainers, stock awards and meeting fees for HEI directors. 
The Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve the compensation program reflected in the FW Cook analysis and, at its October 31, 2018 meeting, the Board approved an increase in the annual cash retainer for the chairpersons of HEI's Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to $20,000 and an increase in the annual cash retainer for the members of those committees to $10,000 in recognition of the increased workload of such committees. These increases were effective January 1, 2019.

Cash retainer. HEI nonemployee directors received the cash amounts shown below as retainer for their 2018 HEI Board service and for their 2018 service on HEI and subsidiary board committees. No separate fees are paid to HEI directors for service on subsidiary company boards, except to the extent that they serve on any committee of a subsidiary board. Cash retainers were paid in quarterly installments.

Stock awards. On June 29, 2018, each HEI nonemployee director received shares of HEI Common Stock with a value equal to $100,000 as an annual grant under HEI's 2011 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan (2011 Director Plan), which was approved by HEI shareholders on May 10, 2011, for the purpose of further aligning directors' and shareholders' interests. The number of shares issued to each HEI nonemployee director was determined based on the closing sales price of HEI Common Stock on the NYSE on June 29, 2018. Stock grants to nonemployee directors under the 2011 Director Plan are made annually on the last business day in June and vest immediately. HEI considers the 2011 Director Plan an important vehicle for the appropriate compensation of its nonemployee directors. Proposal No. 3 in this Proxy Statement requests shareholder approval of an extension of the term of the 2011 Director Plan and an increase in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder. 
Maximum Compensation. At its October 29, 2018 meeting, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, a maximum annual compensation limit of $600,000 for any nonemployee director, to include the aggregate grant date fair value of all awards granted to any nonemployee director during any single calendar year plus the aggregate amount of all cash earned and paid or payable to such director for services rendered for the same year. 
Deferred compensation. Nonemployee directors may participate in the HEI Deferred Compensation Plan implemented in 2011 (2011 Deferred Compensation Plan) and described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Benefits — Deferred Compensation Plans" below. Under the plan, deferred amounts are credited with gains/losses of deemed investments chosen by the participant from a list of publicly traded mutual funds and other investment offerings. Earnings are not above-market or preferential. Participants may elect the timing upon which distributions are to begin following separation from service (including retirement) and may choose to receive such distributions in a lump sum or in installments over a period of up to fifteen years. Lump sum benefits are payable in the event of disability or death. Mr. Taketa participated in this plan in 2018, but no other nonemployee director did so. Nonemployee directors are also eligible to participate in the prior HEI Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended January 1, 2009, although no nonemployee director deferred compensation under such plan in 2018. 
Health benefits. Nonemployee directors may participate, at their election and at their cost, in the group employee medical, vision and dental plans generally made available to HEI, Hawaiian Electric or ASB employees. No nonemployee director participated in such plans in 2018.

      Director stock ownership and retention       
HEI directors are required to own and retain HEI Common Stock throughout their service with the Company. Each director has until his or her compliance date (January 1 of the year following the fifth anniversary of the later of (i) amendment to his or her required level of stock ownership or (ii) first becoming subject to the requirements) to reach the following ownership levels: Chairman of the Board — 2x annual cash retainer; other HEI directors — 5x annual cash retainer. As of January 1, 2018, each director who had reached his or her compliance date had achieved his or her stock ownership target. 
Until reaching the applicable stock ownership target, directors must retain all shares received under their annual stock retainer. The Compensation Committee has the authority to approve hardship exceptions to these retention requirements.  Table of Contents 
   PROPOSAL NO. 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE HEI'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    
  PROPOSAL NO. 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF HEI'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
We are asking for your advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, which we present to our shareholders on an annual basis and which is commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
The Compensation Committee and Board believe that HEI's executive compensation is effective in achieving our goals of promoting long-term value for our shareholders, customers and communities and attracting, motivating and retaining the talent necessary to create such value. Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote FOR the following resolution: 
Resolved, that the shareholders approve, in an advisory vote, the compensation of HEI's named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Executive Compensation Tables sections of the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Executive Compensation Tables portions of this Proxy Statement. These sections describe the Company's executive compensation policies and practices and the compensation of our named executive officers. 
While the say-on-pay vote is advisory and is therefore nonbinding, the Compensation Committee and Board consider the vote results when making future decisions regarding HEI's executive compensation.

      2018 say-on-pay results, shareholder outreach and 2019 program       
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approximately 92% of votes cast approved our executive compensation program through the advisory say-on-pay vote. After evaluating the outcome of the 2018 advisory vote, the Compensation Committee decided not to make any material changes to our executive compensation program. In addition, in 2019, we invited shareholders who collectively held more than 25% of HEI's outstanding shares and key proxy advisory organizations to discuss our executive compensation program. From such outreach, we learned that there was general approval of our program. 
The executive compensation program in place in 2015 and 2016 reflected the fact that HEI's proposed merger with NextEra Energy was pending at that time. In early 2015 and 2016, respectively, the Compensation Committee had provided for the 2015-17 and 2016-18 LTIP to be settled in cash rather than in equity as in prior years, and for relative total shareholder return (TSR) to be replaced by earnings per share (EPS) growth as one of the LTIP metrics. These changes were implemented because the Compensation Committee had determined that while the merger was pending the Company's stock price might be affected at least in part by merger considerations that were unrelated to the Company's true operating performance and that, as a result, the compensatory goals of the LTIP would be better served without taking into account such merger impact. Since the merger agreement between HEI and NextEra Energy was terminated in July 2016, and consistent with the feedback we received from stakeholders during our outreach at that time, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2017-19 and 2018-20 LTIPs would return to being settled in equity and include relative TSR as one of the performance metrics.

     Our roles in determining compensation are well-defined   
[END TABLE]
      Role of the Compensation Committee       
The Compensation Committee oversees the design and implementation of our executive compensation program. On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee engages in a rigorous process to arrive at compensation decisions regarding the named executive officers. In the course of this process, the Compensation Committee: 
Early each year, the Compensation Committee determines payouts under incentive plans ending in the prior year, establishes performance metrics and goals for incentive plans beginning that year and recommends to the Board and subsidiary boards the level of compensation and mix of pay elements for each named executive officer. 
      Role of the independent directors as a whole       
The independent directors evaluate the CEO's performance, consider Compensation Committee recommendations concerning her pay and determine her compensation. The Board and subsidiary boards also review the performance of and Compensation Committee recommendations concerning the other named executive officers and approve their compensation. 
      Role of executive officers       
The CEO, who is also an HEI director, assesses and reports on the performance of the other named executive officers and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to their levels of compensation and mix of pay elements. She also participates in Board deliberations regarding the Compensation Committee's recommendations on the other named executive officers. She does not participate in the deliberations of the Compensation Committee to recommend, or of the Board to determine, her own compensation. 
Management supports the Compensation Committee in executing its responsibilities by providing materials for Compensation Committee meetings (including tally sheets and recommendations regarding performance metrics, goals and pay mix); by attending portions of Compensation Committee meetings as appropriate to provide perspective and expertise relevant to agenda items; and by supplying data and information as requested by the Compensation Committee and/or its independent compensation consultant.  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
      Compensation consultant & consultant independence       
The Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), is retained by, and reports directly to, the Compensation Committee. FW Cook provides the Compensation Committee with independent expertise on market practices and developments in executive compensation, compensation program design, peer group composition and competitive pay levels, and provides related research, data and analyses. FW Cook also advises the Compensation Committee regarding analyses and proposals presented by management related to executive compensation. A representative of FW Cook generally attends Compensation Committee meetings, participates in Compensation Committee executive sessions and communicates directly with the Compensation Committee. 
In early 2019, as in prior years, the Compensation Committee evaluated FW Cook's independence, taking into account all factors it believed to be relevant, including the factors specified in the NYSE listing standards and the absence of other relationships between FW Cook and the Company, its directors or executive officers. Based on such factors and FW Cook's independence policy, which was shared with the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee concluded that FW Cook is independent and that the work of FW Cook has not raised any conflict of interest. 
      We use comparative market data as a reference point for compensation       
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation benchmarking   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers comparative market compensation as a reference in determining pay levels and mix of pay components. While the Compensation Committee seeks to position named executive officer target compensation opportunity (composed of base salary, target performance-based annual incentive, target performance-based long-term incentive and time-vested RSUs) at approximately the comparative market median, the Compensation Committee may decide that an executive's pay opportunity should be higher or lower based on internal equity or the executive's level of responsibility, experience, expertise, performance, retention and succession considerations. 
Information from public company proxy statements for peer group companies was used to provide comparative market data in setting 2018 compensation for all named executive officers. Data from the Willis Towers Watson Energy Services Survey was also used in establishing 2018 compensation. The data was regressed based on HEI's and Hawaiian Electric's revenues for appropriate size comparisons.

     Peer Groups   
[END TABLE]
      Compensation peers       
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the peer groups used in benchmarking for HEI and subsidiary executive compensation, with analysis and recommendations provided by FW Cook. For 2018 compensation, the Compensation Committee determined, with input from FW Cook, that the companies in our 2017 compensation peer group remained appropriate and that no changes were necessary for 2018. The selection criteria and resulting 2018 peer groups are set forth below.  Table of Contents

      Performance peers       
In addition to the peer companies used for benchmarking executive compensation, certain of the performance metrics used in the long-term incentive plans (described below under "Long-term incentives") are based on performance relative to performance peers. HEI's Relative TSR performance is based on HEI's performance compared to the utilities in the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Index. 
      2018 Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Index Peers for HEI  Long-Term Incentive Plan Relative TSR Metric         
The EEI is an association of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies that are representative of comparable investment alternatives to HEI. The EEI's members serve virtually all of the ultimate customers in the shareholder-owned segment of the industry. The following companies comprise the 2018 EEI Index used for HEI's Relative TSR metric:

     Base salary   
[END TABLE]
Base salaries for our named executive officers are reviewed and determined annually. In establishing base salaries for the year, the Compensation Committee considers competitive market data, internal equity and each executive's level of responsibility, experience, expertise, performance and retention and succession considerations. The Compensation Committee considers the competitive median in setting base salaries, but may determine that the foregoing factors compel a higher or lower salary. 
For 2018, in order to recognize their performance and maintain the market competitiveness of their pay, each of our named executive officers received a base salary increase of 3.0%. The resulting 2018 base salaries are shown in the table above. For all named executive officers other than Mr. Wacker, base salary increases for 2017 became effective as of March 1, 2017 and base salary increases for 2018 became effective as of March 1, 2018. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, amounts referenced as 2017 and 2018 base salary are prorated amounts to include two months of 2016 and 2017 base salary, respectively, and ten months of 2017 and 2018 base salary, respectively. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Annual incentives   
[END TABLE]
HEI named executive officers and other executives are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under HEI's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (EICP) based on the achievement of performance goals for the year. Each year, the Compensation Committee determines the target annual incentive opportunity for each executive, performance metrics and the applicable goals. 
      2018 target annual incentive opportunity       
The target annual incentive opportunity is a percentage of base salary, with the threshold and maximum opportunities equal to 0.5 times and 2 times target, respectively. In establishing the target percentage for each executive, the Compensation Committee takes into account the mix of pay elements, competitive market data, internal equity, prior performance and other factors described above under "Base salary." 
The 2018 target annual incentive opportunities for the named executive officers are shown in the table above. For 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, keeping the 2018 target opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) the same as the 2017 target opportunity for each of our named executive officers.

   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
      2018 performance metrics, goals, results & payouts       
The performance metrics for annual incentives are chosen because they connect directly to the Company's strategic priorities and correlate with creating shareholder value. The 2018 performance metrics for Ms. Lau and Mr. Hazelton related to the holding company and its subsidiaries, while the metrics for Mr. Oshima related to the utility and the metrics for Mr. Wacker related to the bank. The rationale for each metric is shown in the chart below. 
In addition to selecting performance metrics, the Compensation Committee determines the level of achievement required to attain the threshold, target and maximum goal for each metric. The level of difficulty of the goals reflects the Compensation Committee's belief that incentive pay should be motivational — that is, the goals should be challenging but achievable — and that such pay should be balanced with reinvestment in the Company and return to shareholders. Consistent with this approach, the Compensation Committee believes the threshold should represent solid performance with positive financial/operating results, target should denote achievable goals that include a stretch factor and maximum should signify truly exceptional performance. 
The target level for financial goals, such as net income and ROA, is generally set at the level of the Board-approved budget, which represents the level of accomplishment the Company seeks to achieve for the year. In setting the threshold and maximum levels, the Compensation Committee considers expected industry-specific metrics and whether the risks to accomplishing the budget weigh more heavily toward the downside and how challenging it would be to achieve incremental improvements over the target level. 
The chart below identifies the 2018 annual incentive metrics, the objective each measure serves, the level of achievement required to attain the threshold, target and maximum levels for each metric, the results for 2018 and the percentage of target achieved.

      Non-GAAP Net Income Metrics — 2018 Annual Incentive
HEI Consolidated's, Utility Consolidated's and ASB's adjusted net income metrics for 2018 annual incentive compensation were calculated on a non-GAAP basis because the Compensation Committee determined that the impacts associated with recent tax reform legislation, certain unanticipated extraordinary consulting fees and certain other expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger with NextEra Energy, including Hawaiian Electric's liquefied natural gas (LNG) project costs and adjustments to test year revenue requirements for customer benefit adjustments in the Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric rate case decisions, should not be considered in determining performance under those metrics. The Compensation Committee deemed this to be appropriate since such amounts were for extraordinary events unrelated to HEI, Hawaiian Electric or ASB managements' actions regarding ongoing business operations and taking such factors into account thus would be inconsistent with the original intent and nature of the award. 
The exclusion of the amounts described above resulted in adjustments of $8.6 million, $7.6 million, and $(33,000) to the 2018 GAAP net income for HEI, Hawaiian Electric and ASB, respectively, in determining adjusted net income. See "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures: Incentive Compensation Adjustments," attached as Exhibit B. 
The following chart shows how% of Target Achieved from the table above is converted into a dollar value for each named executive officer. The payout amounts are also shown in the "Nonequity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 51.

     Long-term incentives   
[END TABLE]
Long-term incentives include performance-based opportunities under HEI's LTIP, which is based on achievement of performance goals over rolling three-year periods, and time-vested RSUs, which vest over a four-year period. The performance-based LTIP represents the majority of each named executive officer's long-term incentive opportunity. These incentives are designed to directly tie executive interests with those of shareholders by rewarding executives for long-term value growth. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Long-term performance-based incentives   
[END TABLE]
The three-year performance periods foster a long-term perspective and provide balance with the shorter-term focus of the annual incentive program. In addition, the overlapping three-year performance periods encourage sustained high levels of performance because at any one time three separate potential awards are affected by current performance. 
Similar to the annual incentives, in developing long-term incentives, the Compensation Committee determines the target incentive opportunity for each executive, performance metrics and goals for the three-year period.  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
      2018-20 target long-term incentive opportunity       
As with the annual incentives, the target long-term incentive opportunity is a percentage of base salary, with the threshold and maximum opportunities equal to 0.5 times and 2 times target, respectively. In establishing the target percentage for each executive, the Compensation Committee considers the mix of pay elements, competitive market data, internal equity, performance and the other factors described above under "Base salary." 
For the 2018-20 period, the Compensation Committee made no changes to the target incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary for Ms. Lau, and Messrs. Hazelton, Oshima and Wacker, as it determined that their target long-term incentive opportunities from the prior performance period remained appropriate at 160%, 80%, 95% and 80%, respectively. See table on page 34. 
      2018-20 performance metrics and goals       
The performance metrics for long-term incentives are chosen for their direct relation to creating long-term value for shareholders. 
In addition to selecting performance metrics, the Compensation Committee determines the level of achievement required to attain the threshold, target and maximum performance for each metric. The same principles that the Compensation Committee applies to annual incentive goals apply to long-term incentive goals. As such, the level of difficulty of the goals reflects the Compensation Committee's belief that incentive pay should be motivational — that is, the goals should be challenging but achievable — and that such pay should be balanced with reinvestment in the Company and return to shareholders. Consistent with this approach, the Compensation Committee believes threshold should represent solid performance with positive financial/operating results, target should denote achievable goals that include a stretch factor and maximum should signify truly exceptional performance. 
The target level for financial goals, such as the total shareholder return relative to the EEI Index (Relative TSR), average annual earnings per share (EPS) growth and return on average common equity (ROACE), relate to the levels the Company seeks to achieve over the performance period. In setting the threshold and maximum levels, the Compensation Committee considers whether the risks to accomplishing those levels weigh more heavily toward the downside and how challenging it would be to achieve incremental improvements over the target result. For the 2018-20 period, the Compensation Committee chose the metrics and goals in the following chart to encourage long-term achievement of earnings and growth in shareholder value.  Table of Contents 
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
Customers, employees and shareholders all benefit when the above goals are met. Achievement of these goals makes HEI, the utility and the bank stronger financially, enabling HEI to raise capital at favorable rates for reinvestment in the operating companies and supporting dividends to shareholders. From a historical perspective, long-term incentive payouts are not easy to achieve, nor are they guaranteed. HEI and its utility and bank subsidiaries face significant external challenges in the 2018-20 period. Extraordinary leadership on the part of the named executive officers will be needed to achieve the long-term objectives required for them to earn the incentive payouts. 
 2016-18 Long-Term Incentive Plan.    The HEI Board and HEI Compensation Committee established the 2016-18 long-term incentive opportunities, performance metrics and goals in February 2016.

   Adjustments for unusual events — 2016-18 LTIP       
The Compensation Committee considers adjustments to performance results with caution and only in circumstances that are unforeseen and/or unique or extraordinary. The Compensation Committee recognizes that the two operating subsidiaries are heavily regulated and external forces can impact incentive plans significantly. The Compensation Committee is mindful of only considering adjustments that are warranted and will also serve the long-term interests of shareholders. 
HEI. In determining HEI consolidated net income for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 for purposes of calculating HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth under the 2016-18 LTIP, the Compensation Committee considered the impact of certain items that were unrelated to HEI, Hawaiian Electric or ASB managements' actions regarding ongoing business operations, including the effects in 2018 of the 2017 tax reform legislation and certain unanticipated extraordinary consulting expenses. In addition to the 2017 tax reform impacts at ASB and Hawaiian Electric (see below), 2017 tax reform and such consulting expenses had an aggregate $5.7 million negative impact on HEI's 2018 results. The Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to exclude the impact of the 2017 tax reform legislation and unanticipated consulting expenses on HEI's 2018 results because such impact was for extraordinary events unrelated to management's actions regarding ongoing business operations. The adjustments described on page 41 of HEI's 2018 Proxy Statement with respect to HEI's 2017, 2016 and 2015 results, for purposes of the 2015-17 LTIP, were also applied to the 2016-18 LTIP. The adjustments include: (i) $6.0 million negative impact in 2017 related to tax reform legislation; (ii) $58.2 million positive impact in 2016 related to income from the terminated merger with NextEra Energy and canceled spin-off of ASB Hawaii, Inc.; and (iii) $15.8 million negative impact of merger-related expenses in 2015. These tax reform and merger- and spin-off related income and expenses were not considered in determining performance under the metrics and were for an extraordinary event unrelated to HEI or Hawaiian Electric managements' actions regarding ongoing business operations. See below under ASB and Hawaiian Electric for more discussion and for all other items impacting HEI consolidated net income.  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS    
ASB. In determining ASB's 2016, 2017 and 2018 net income for purposes of calculating HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth and ASB's 3-year average net income and ASB's 2016, 2017 and 2018 net income and common equity for the ASB portion of the Weighted Composite of Utility (two-thirds) and ASB (one-third) 3-year ROACE (Weighted Composite ROACE) under the 2016-18 LTIP, the Compensation Committee considered the impact of certain items that were unrelated to managements' actions regarding ongoing business operations, including the effects in 2018 of the 2017 tax reform legislation, one-time expenses related to ASB's new corporate campus, and the effect of ASB's initiative to eliminate risk associated with the pension liability and volatility of pension expense for its frozen pension plan through a process called "defeasement," which is designed to cause material asset and liability movements to offset each other. Because the Company calculates net periodic pension cost using a market-related value of plan assets, the favorable accounting impact of the defeasement is diminished. Pension defeasement combined with the use of market-related value of plan assets had a negative accounting impact on ASB's net income of $0.05 million, $0.3 million and $1.0 million for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to exclude defeasement amounts for purposes of determining ASB's net income for the 2016-18 LTIP because the Company's consolidated asset valuation method diminished the positive accounting impacts of the defeasement. Over time, the defeasement is expected to benefit shareholder value by reducing ASB's need to provide additional funds to satisfy its pension obligations. The tax reform and related net positive impact amounting to $11.2 million for 2018 and the one-time expenses related to ASB's new corporate campus negative impact amounting to $0.7 million for 2018 were excluded in the calculation of the 2016-18 HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth, net income and Weighted Composite ROACE. The $1.0 million positive impact in 2017 related to tax reform legislation described on page 50 of HEI's 2018 Proxy Statement was excluded in the calculation of the 2015-17 HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth and ASB's goals. The Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to exclude the 2017 impacts in determining ASB's net income for purposes of calculating HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth, ASB's 3-year average net income and Weighted Composite ROACE under the 2016-18 LTIP. ASB's 2018 efficiency ratio includes the pre-tax adjustments relating to pension, tax reform and related impacts and the new corporate campus. ASB's noninterest income and noninterest expense included a reclassification of debit card interchange fees resulting from a new accounting standard that reclassified debit card expenses to noninterest income, but such reclassification did not have an impact on the level of achievement for the ASB efficiency ratio. 
Hawaiian Electric. In determining Hawaiian Electric's 2016, 2017 and 2018 net income and common equity for the ROACE as a% of Allowed Return and the utility portion of the Weighted Composite ROACE and Hawaiian Electric's 2016, 2017 and 2018 net income for HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth under the 2016-18 LTIP, the Compensation Committee considered the impacts of certain items that were unrelated to managements' actions regarding ongoing business operations, including the effects in 2018 of the 2017 tax reform legislation and certain expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger with NextEra Energy, including Hawaiian Electric's LNG project costs and adjustments to test year revenue requirements for customer benefit adjustments in the Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric rate case decisions. The aggregate negative impact on Hawaiian Electric's 2018 net income of these adjustments of a net $7.6 million was included in the calculation of the ROACE as a% of Allowed Return, Weighted Composite ROACE and HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth. The Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to exclude the impact of these factors because such impacts were for extraordinary events unrelated to management's actions regarding ongoing business operations.

The adjustments described on pages 39 of HEI's 2018 Proxy Statement with respect to Hawaiian Electric's 2017 results, under the 2015-17 LTIP, were also applied as the tax reform legislation and the effect of the reversion to the lagged method of recognizing rate adjustment mechanism (RAM) revenues had negative impacts on Hawaiian Electric's 2017 net income of $9.2 million and $13.9 million, respectively, and were excluded under the 2016-18 LTIP ROACE as a% of Allowed Return, Weighted Composite ROACE and HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth. The Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to exclude the impacts of tax reform and reversion of RAM to the lagged method of revenue recognition amounts because they were unrelated to management's decisions and actions and they were not contemplated at the time the performance goals were established. 
The adjustments described on page 44 of HEI's 2017 Proxy Statement with respect to Hawaiian Electric's 2016 results for purposes of the 2014-16 LTIP were applied in calculating the 2016-18 LTIP ROACE as a% of Allowed Return, Weighted Composite ROACE and HEI 3-year average annual EPS growth as the events leading to those adjustments were not contemplated at the time the 2016-18 LTIP goals were established and were unrelated to Hawaiian Electric management's decisions and actions. In addition, $0.5 million in merger integration expenses incurred by Hawaiian Electric in 2015 and $2.2 million of merger-related expenses after-tax incurred by Hawaiian Electric in 2016, including costs related to Hawaiian Electric's terminated LNG contract, which was conditioned on PUC approval of the merger were also not considered as the Compensation Committee deemed the exclusion of these expenses to be appropriate in light of the termination of the merger agreement and the associated cessation of LNG efforts and because such amounts were for extraordinary events unrelated to HEI or Hawaiian Electric managements' actions regarding ongoing business operations.

     Restricted stock units   
[END TABLE]
HEI named executive officers are eligible to receive annual equity-based grants in the form of RSUs that vest over a four-year period. RSUs offer executives the opportunity to receive shares of HEI Common Stock when the restrictions lapse, generally subject to continued employment with the Company through vesting. 
The value of the annual RSU grant is a percentage of the executive's base salary as shown on page 34. These awards are designed to focus executives on creating long-term value for the Company's stakeholders. Since they take four years to fully vest, the RSUs also promote retention. The RSUs vest and convert to shares of HEI Common Stock in four equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant (plus compounded dividend equivalent shares on the installment that vested in such year). 
The 2018 RSU grants are set forth in the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 53.

     Benefits   
[END TABLE]
      Retirement and savings plans       
HEI, Hawaiian Electric and ASB provide retirement benefits to the named executive officers to promote financial security in recognition of years of service and to attract and retain high-quality leaders. 
HEI and Hawaiian Electric employees (including each named executive officer employed by HEI or Hawaiian Electric), but not ASB employees, are eligible to participate in the HEI Retirement Plan, which is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, and to save for retirement on a tax-deferred (or Roth) basis through HEI's Retirement Savings Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan, which does not provide non-elective employer contributions for any participants and does not provide matching contributions for participants who joined the Company before May 1, 2011.  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS    
In 2011, HEI amended the HEI Retirement Plan and HEI Retirement Savings Plan to create a new benefit structure for employees hired on or after May 1, 2011. Employees covered by the new benefit structure receive a reduced pension benefit under the HEI Retirement Plan, but are eligible for limited matching contributions under the HEI Retirement Savings Plan. These changes were intended to lower the cost of pension benefits over the long term. Messrs. Hazelton and Oshima each joined the Company after May 1, 2011 and are eligible to receive matching contributions under the amended HEI Retirement Savings Plan. Ms. Lau is not eligible for and did not receive matching contributions under that plan, since she joined the Company prior to May 1, 2011. The HEI Retirement Savings Plan does not provide employer contributions, other than matching contributions, to any participant. 
Additional retirement benefits that cannot be paid from the HEI Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limits are provided to named executive officers and other executives employed by HEI and Hawaiian Electric through the nonqualified HEI Excess Pay Plan. Benefits under the HEI Excess Pay Plan are determined using the same formula as the HEI Retirement Plan, but are not subject to the Internal Revenue Code limits on the amount of annual compensation that can be used for calculating benefits under qualified retirement plans and on the amount of annual benefits that can be paid from qualified retirement plans. This allows those participating in the HEI Excess Pay Plan a total retirement benefit at the same general percentage of final average pay afforded to other employees under the HEI Retirement Plan. 
ASB's employees, including its president and CEO (who is a named executive officer), may participate in the ASB 401(k) Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan. After an employee has completed one year of service, ASB matches the employee's contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 4% of eligible compensation deferred. In 2018, eligible compensation was capped at $275,000. ASB also provides discretionary, nonelective profit sharing contributions to the accounts of employees who are employed on the last day of the plan year or terminate employment during the plan year because of retirement, death or disability. Mr. Wacker received matching contributions and a profit sharing contribution under the plan in 2018, in each case limited to the amount permitted based on eligible compensation. 
Retirement benefits are discussed in further detail in the "2018 Pension Benefits" table and related notes on pages 56-57. 
      Deferred compensation plans       
HEI provides named executive officers and other executives the opportunity to participate in plans that allow them to defer compensation and the resulting tax liability. 
HEI and Hawaiian Electric named executive officers and directors of HEI, Hawaiian Electric and ASB may participate in the HEI Deferred Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan implemented in 2011 that allows the deferral of portions of the participants' cash compensation, with certain limitations, and provides investment opportunities that are substantially similar to those available under HEI's Retirement Savings Plan. In 2018, there were no matching or other employer contributions under this plan. HEI and Hawaiian Electric named executive officers are also eligible to defer payment of annual and long-term incentive awards and the resulting tax liability under a prior nonqualified deferred compensation plan, although no named executive officer deferred compensation under that plan in 2018. 
The American Savings Bank Select Deferred Compensation Plan (ASB Deferred Compensation Plan) is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows senior members of ASB management to defer up to 100% of current salary, annual bonus and commissions. Pursuant to a 2009 amendment, the plan provides for employer matching contributions and profit sharing contributions. These matching and profit sharing contributions take into account compensation which is excluded from consideration under the ASB 401(k) Plan, including on account of being contributed to the ASB Deferred Compensation Plan or being in excess of limits on eligible compensation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Ms. Lau participated in the ASB Deferred Compensation Plan during her employment with ASB. Mr. Wacker did not elect to defer compensation under such plan in 2018, but he did receive a profit sharing contribution to his account under the plan for the amount that could not be contributed to his 401(k) Plan account due to Internal Revenue Code limits on eligible compensation. Such profit sharing contribution is included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 51. 
Deferred compensation benefits are discussed in further detail in the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table and related notes on page 58.  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
      Executive Death Benefit Plan (frozen since 2009)       
In September 2009, HEI froze the Executive Death Benefit Plan of HEI and Participating Subsidiaries, which provides death benefits to an executive's beneficiaries following the executive's death while employed or after retirement. As part of the freeze, HEI closed the plan to new participants and ceased all benefit accruals for current participants (i.e., there will be no increase in death benefits due to salary increases after September 9, 2009). 
Under contracts with Executive Death Benefit Plan participants in effect before September 2009, the death benefits were grossed up for tax purposes. This treatment was considered appropriate because the executive death benefit is a form of life insurance and traditionally life insurance proceeds have been excluded from income for federal tax purposes. Ms. Lau is covered under the Executive Death Benefit Plan. Messrs. Hazelton and Oshima are not covered under the plan because they joined the Company after the plan was frozen. Mr. Wacker also joined ASB after the plan was frozen, and ASB was not a participating employer in the plan in any event. Death benefits are discussed in further detail in the "2018 Pension Benefits" table and related notes on pages 56-57. 
      Double-trigger change-in-control agreements       
The Compensation Committee and Board consider change-in-control agreements to be an appropriate tool to recruit executives as an expected part of their compensation package, to encourage the continued attention of key executives to the performance of their duties without distraction in the event of a potential change in control and to assist in retaining key executives. Change-in-control agreements can protect against executive flight during a transaction when key executives might, in the absence of the agreement, leave the Company and accept employment elsewhere. As of December 31, 2018, Ms. Lau and Messrs. Hazelton and Wacker each had a change-in-control agreement. 
All of the change-in-control agreements are double trigger, which means that they provide for cash severance and other benefits only upon a qualifying termination of the executives' employment following a change in control. In determining the amount an executive is eligible to receive in such an event, the Compensation Committee takes into account the executive's expected role in a potential transaction, value to the organization and internal equity. The agreements approved by the Compensation Committee provide for a cash lump sum payment of three times base salary plus annual incentive for Ms. Lau and two times base salary plus annual incentive for Messrs. Hazelton and Wacker. The annual incentive pay used in calculating the severance payment is the greater of the current annual incentive target or the largest actual annual incentive payout during the preceding three fiscal years. Aggregate payments under these agreements are limited to the maximum amount deductible under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and there are no tax gross ups with respect to payments under these agreements. Payment of the severance benefits is conditioned on the Company receiving a release of claims by the executive. 
The change-in-control agreements have initial terms of two years and automatically renew for an additional year on each anniversary unless 90 days' notice of nonrenewal is provided by either party, so that the protected period is at least one year upon nonrenewal. The agreements remain in effect for two years following a change in control. The agreements define a change in control as a change in ownership of HEI, a substantial change in the voting power of HEI's securities or a change in the majority of the composition of the Board following consummation of a merger, tender offer or similar transaction. The agreement for Mr. Wacker also defines a change in control as a change in ownership of ASB. Change-in-control benefits are discussed in further detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section and related notes on pages 59-60.  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
      Minimal perquisites       
HEI provides minimal other compensation to the named executive officers in the form of perquisites because such items are commonly provided to business executives in Hawaii, such as club memberships primarily for the purpose of business entertainment, or are necessary to recruit executives, such as relocation expenses or extra weeks of vacation. HEI may, from time to time, reimburse for reasonable business-related expenses. In 2018, each named executive officer had a Company-paid club membership for the primary purpose of business entertainment expected of executives in their positions. Mr. Hazelton received four weeks of vacation in 2018, which was more than other employees with similar length of service typically receive. Mr. Wacker received 28 days of paid time off in 2018, which is more than ASB employees with similar length of service below the senior vice president level receive. 
      No new tax gross ups       
HEI has eliminated nearly all tax gross ups. There are no tax gross ups on club membership initiation fees or membership dues, or in the change-in-control agreements for the named executive officers who have such agreements. As discussed under "Executive Death Benefit Plan," tax gross ups of death benefits only apply to executives who participated in the Executive Death Benefit Plan before it was frozen in 2009. 
   Additional policies and information
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Our programs are designed to guard against excessive risk   
[END TABLE]
HEI's compensation policies and practices are designed to encourage executives to build value for all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and employees, and to discourage decisions that introduce inappropriate risks. 
HEI's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function is principally responsible for identifying and monitoring risk at the holding company and its subsidiaries, and for reporting on high risk areas to the Board and designated Board committees. As a result, all HEI directors, including those who serve on the Compensation Committee, are apprised of risks that could have a material adverse effect on HEI. 
Risk assessment.    On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant review a risk assessment of compensation programs in place at HEI and its subsidiaries for all employees, which is updated annually by the Company's ERM function. Based on its review of the risk assessment of compensation programs in place in 2018 and consultation with FW Cook, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation plans do not encourage risk taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Risk mitigation features of our programs.    Our compensation programs incorporate the following features to promote prudent decision-making and guard against excessive risk: Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
Committee decided to provide for the 2016-18 LTIP to be settled in cash in lieu of HEI Common Stock. The Compensation Committee determined that the Company's stock price might be affected at least in part by merger considerations unrelated to the Company's true operating performance and that, as a result, the compensatory goals of the LTIPs would be better served by a cash settlement. Following the termination of the HEI/NextEra Energy merger agreement in July 2016, the Compensation Committee determined in 2017 to return to exclusively equity-based LTIPs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Share ownership and retention are required throughout employment with the Company   
[END TABLE]
HEI named executive officers are required to own and retain HEI stock throughout employment with the Company. Each officer subject to the requirements has until January 1 of the year following the fifth anniversary of the later of (i) amendment to his or her required level of stock ownership, or (ii) first becoming subject to the requirements (compliance date) to reach the following ownership levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         HEI President & CEO                  5x base salary 
         Other Named Executive Officers                  2x base salary  
[END TABLE]
The compliance dates were January 1, 2015 for Ms. Lau, January 1, 2016 for Mr. Wacker, January 1, 2020 for Mr. Oshima and January 1, 2022 for Mr. Hazelton. Ms. Lau and Mr. Wacker exceeded the specified level of stock ownership for their positions by the time of their respective compliance dates. 
Until reaching the applicable stock ownership target, officers subject to the requirements must retain 50% of shares received in payout under the LTIP (net of any shares withheld for taxes) and 50% of shares received through the vesting of RSUs (net of any shares withheld for taxes). The Compensation Committee has the authority to approve hardship exceptions to these retention requirements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Hedging and pledging are prohibited   
[END TABLE]
The Company's Insider Trading Policy, among other prohibitions, prohibits all directors, officers and employees of HEI and its subsidiaries (as well as the spouses, minor children, adult family members sharing the same household and any other person for whom the director, officer or employee exercises substantial control over such person's securities trading decisions) from trading in options, warrants, puts, calls or similar instruments on Company securities, making short sales in Company securities, holding Company securities in margin accounts or pledging Company securities. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Clawback policy applies to performance-based pay   
[END TABLE]
HEI has an executive compensation clawback policy that applies to any performance-based compensation awarded to an executive officer. Under that policy, in the event the financial statements of HEI or any of its subsidiaries are significantly restated, the Compensation Committee and Board will review the circumstances that caused the need for the restatement and determine whether fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct were involved. If so, the Board may direct the Company to recover all or a portion of  Table of Contents
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS    
any performance-based award from the executive officer(s) found personally responsible. The SEC has issued proposed rules concerning clawback policies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. HEI will amend its clawback policy to ensure it is consistent with the final rules as and when required. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     The Compensation Committee considers tax and accounting impacts on compensation   
[END TABLE]
In designing compensation programs, the Compensation Committee considers tax and accounting implications of its decisions, along with other factors described in this Proxy Statement. 
Tax matters.    Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits to $1 million, per applicable executive, the annual federal income tax deduction that a publicly held corporation may claim for compensation payable to certain covered executive officers. The tax reform legislation passed in December 2017 amended Section 162(m), among other changes, to broaden the scope to include both current and former covered executives and to eliminate an exemption to this deduction limitation for certain performance-based compensation. 
In determining compensation for our executive officers, the Compensation Committee primarily considers factors that provide incentives for the achievement of business objectives, but also considers the extent to which the compensation is deductible. The Compensation Committee continues to evaluate the changes to Section 162(m) and their significance to the company's compensation programs, but retains the flexibility and discretion to structure compensation appropriately, whether or not deductible. 
Another tax consideration factored into the design of the Company's compensation programs is compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, for which noncompliance can result in additional taxes on participants in deferred compensation arrangements. The new tax reform law did not change the requirements of Section 409A. 
Accounting matters.    In establishing performance goals for equity compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the impact of accounting rules, including relevant plan provisions that govern how discretion may be used. Accounting rules also prescribe the way in which compensation is expensed. For example, under GAAP, compensation is generally expensed when earned. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 generally requires that equity compensation awards be accounted for based on their grant date fair value and recognized over the relevant service periods. The Compensation Committee also has discretion in determining the level of achievement for the award and may determine that there should not be any incentive payout that would result solely from the adoption of a new accounting principle that affects a financial measure or vice versa.

 HEI and Hawaiian Electric management employees who commenced employment on or after May 1, 2011, including Messrs. Hazelton and Oshima, receive reduced benefits under the HEI Retirement Plan (e.g., reduced benefit formula, more stringent requirements for subsidized early retirement benefits, reduced early retirement subsidies and no post-retirement cost-of-living adjustment). Normal retirement benefits for these employees are calculated based on a formula of 1.5% × Credited Service × Final Average Compensation (average monthly base salary for highest thirty-six consecutive months out of the last ten years). These employees are eligible for a limited match under the HEI Retirement Savings Plan (50% match on the first 6% of compensation deferred).

      Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control       
The table below shows the potential payments to each named executive officer in the event of retirement, death or disability, voluntary termination, termination for cause, termination without cause and termination after change in control, assuming termination occurred on December 31, 2018. The amounts listed below are estimates; actual amounts to be paid would depend on the actual date of termination and circumstances existing at that time. 
      2018  TERMINATION/CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PAYMENT TABLE         
Note: All stock-based award amounts were valued using the 2018 year-end closing price of HEI Common Stock on the NYSE of $36.62 per share on December 31, 2018. Other benefits that are available to all salaried employees on a nondiscriminatory basis and perquisites aggregating less than $10,000 in value have not been listed.
Termination for cause payments & benefits.    If the executive is terminated for cause, he or she could lose any annual or long-term incentives based upon the Compensation Committee's right to amend, suspend or terminate any incentive award or any portion of it at any time. "Cause" generally means a violation of the HEI Corporate Code of Conduct or, for purposes of awards under the 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan, as amended (EIP), has the meaning set forth in such plan. Termination for cause results in the forfeiture of all unvested RSUs and participation in incentive plans. The executive's entitlement to rights under his or her change-in-control agreement would also end.
Termination without cause payments & benefits.    If the executive is terminated without cause, he or she could lose any annual or long-term incentives based upon the Compensation Committee's right to amend, suspend or terminate any incentive award or any portion of it at any time.   Table of Contents
   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    
 Termination without cause results in the forfeiture of unvested RSUs. As discussed in footnote 4 below, different benefits would be payable to the named executive officers if their termination without cause were to follow a change in control under the terms of their change-in-control agreements.
"Change in control" generally means a change in ownership of HEI, a substantial change in the voting power of HEI's securities or a change in the majority of the composition of the Board following the consummation of a merger, tender offer or similar transaction. Mr. Wacker's change-in-control agreement defines "change in control" to also mean a sale of (or equivalent transaction involving) ASB. The change-in-control agreements are double trigger, which means that they provide for cash severance and other benefits only upon a qualifying termination of the executives' employment following a change in control. Ms. Lau has a lump sum severance multiplier of three times and Messrs. Hazelton and Wacker have a lump sum severance multiplier of two times, in each case applied to the sum of the executive's base salary and annual incentive compensation (determined to be the greater of the current target or the largest actual annual incentive compensation during the preceding three years).
In addition, under the change-in-control agreements executives would receive continued life, disability, dental, accident and health insurance benefits for the severance period (i.e., the number of years equal to the applicable severance multiplier). Executives would receive a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the additional benefit the executives would have earned under their respective retirement and savings plans during the severance period. Executives would also receive the greater of current target or actual projected EICP and cash-based LTIP compensation, pro-rated if termination occurs during the first half of the applicable performance period and the full value if termination occurs in the second half of the applicable performance period. For RSUs not granted under the LTIP, in the event of a change in control as defined by the EIP, either (i) the surviving or acquiring entity will assume all outstanding RSUs not granted under LTIP or will substitute similar awards and such awards would vest in full upon a termination within 24 months following the change in control without cause or by the participant with good reason, as each term is defined by the EIP or (ii) to the extent the surviving entity refuses to assume or substitute such awards, such awards shall become fully vested. For the named executive officers who are eligible to participate in the HEI Retirement Plan, additional age and service credit is received for the severance period for purposes of determining retiree welfare benefit eligibility. Executives would receive outplacement services, capped at 15% of annual base salary. Payment would generally be delayed for six months following termination of employment to the extent required to avoid an additional tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Interest would accrue during any six-month delay period at the prevailing six-month certificate of deposit rate and payments would be set aside during that period in a grantor (rabbi) trust. There are no tax gross ups provided for in the agreements and, as provided in the change-in-control agreements, the total severance amount shown is limited to the maximum amount deductible under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each named executive officer. Payment of the foregoing benefits is subject to a release of claims by the applicable named executive officer. Table of Contents

      CEO Pay Ratio       
As required by SEC rules, we are disclosing the ratio of our median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our CEO. 
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are using the same median employee we used to calculate our 2017 CEO pay ratio because there have been no changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. We identified our median employee by evaluating 2016 Form W-2s for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on October 1, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis and assumed no compensation earned in 2016 for employees hired in 2017. We believe that the use of Form W-2 compensation for all employees is an appropriate compensation measure for this purpose because it reasonably reflects annual compensation for our employees. 
We calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above. The SEC rules allow for varying methodologies for companies to identify their median employee. Other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. Therefore, the pay ratios reported by other companies are unlikely to be relevant for purposes of comparison to our pay ratio.

Due to the NextEra Energy merger that was pending at the time the 2015-17 and 2016-18 long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) were established, these two LTIPs were denominated in cash rather than in stock. This is because the Compensation Committee had determined that while the merger was pending, HEI's stock price might be affected at least in part by merger considerations that were unrelated to HEI's true operating performance and that, as a result, the compensatory goals of the LTIP would be better served without such merger impact. Following the termination of the HEI/NextEra Energy merger in July 2016, HEI returned to exclusively equity-based LTIPs in 2017, which impacts the comparative compensation amounts disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Although our LTIP programs and practices have not changed (i.e., one 3-year LTIP is granted each year), due to the disclosure timing differences between cash-based and equity-based LTIPs, the reported compensation amounts in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 and 2017 are notably higher than, and not comparable to, the reported amounts for 2016 as they contain two LTIPs because of the disclosure differences, and are not reflective of the target compensation provided to our NEOs for 2018 and 2017. Due to SEC disclosure rules, the 2018 and 2017 compensation amounts in the SCT include both the 2016-18 LTIP and 2015-17 LTIP respective cash payouts and the 2018-20 and 2017-19 respective equity-based LTIP. By contrast, the 2016 compensation amounts in the SCT do not include any LTIP amounts. Please see page 50 under "Summary Compensation Table".  Table of Contents

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires HEI's executive officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of HEI's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reporting persons are also required by SEC regulations to furnish HEI with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on its review of such forms provided to it, HEI believes that each of the persons required to comply with the Section 16(a) reporting requirements with regard to HEI complied with such reporting requirements for 2018.

   PROPOSAL NO. 3: APPROVAL OF EXTENSION OF THE 2011 NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN   
  PROPOSAL NO. 3: APPROVAL OF EXTENSION OF THE TERM OF THE HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, INC. 2011 NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN AND INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER
HEI's Compensation Committee and Board believe that the use of stock grants as a major part of the compensation to the nonemployee directors of HEI and its operating subsidiaries, whose oversight contributions are essential to the growth and success of HEI's business, best strengthens the commitment of these individuals to HEI and its subsidiaries, motivates such persons to faithfully and diligently perform their oversight responsibilities and attracts and retains competent and experienced persons whose efforts will contribute to the growth and success of HEI. To that end, on February 8, 2011, the Board approved the Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. 2011 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan (Plan), subject to the approval of HEI's shareholders, which was obtained in 2011. The purpose of the Plan is to motivate nonemployee directors of HEI and its operating subsidiaries to continue as directors, to align their interests with those of HEI's shareholders, and to increase their efforts to promote HEI's business. 
On February 14, 2019, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting, an amendment of the Plan that extends the term of the Plan to February 14, 2029, the tenth anniversary of the Board of Directors' approval of the extension of the Plan, and which also increases the authorized number of shares of Company stock that may be issued with respect to awards under the Plan from 300,000 shares to 600,000 shares, an increase of 300,000. As of December 31, 2018 there were 46,607 shares of HEI Common Stock reserved for issuance and unissued under the Plan. 
The extension of the term of the Plan and the increase in the number of authorized shares of Company stock that may be issued with respect to awards under the Plan is being submitted to HEI's shareholders in order to ensure compliance with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards concerning shareholder approval of equity compensation plans. Under the NYSE listing standards, this Proposal No. 3 will be approved if a majority of the votes cast are in favor of such approval. Abstentions will be considered votes cast and will have the same effect as voting against the proposal. Broker nonvotes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Plan.

     How was the number of additional shares determined?   
[END TABLE]
In determining the number of additional shares to authorize under the Plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board considered a number of factors, including the following:  Table of Contents

average burn rate for this period is 0.24%, which is within competitive industry levels; 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     What are the purposes and terms of the Plan?   
[END TABLE]
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Plan, which as proposed to be amended is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. 
 Purposes.    The purposes of the Plan are to:
 Administration of the Plan.    The Plan is administered in the discretion of a committee which may be the Compensation Committee, a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee or such other committee as may be appointed as administrator from time to time by the Board. 
 Eligibility to Participate.    The Plan provides benefits only to individuals who, on the applicable Grant Date (as described below), are nonemployee directors of HEI or nonemployee directors of HEI operating subsidiaries approved as participating companies by the Board (presently Hawaiian Electric Company and American Savings Bank). Eight HEI nonemployee directors, five American Savings Bank nonemployee directors (who are not also HEI directors) and four Hawaiian Electric Company nonemployee directors (who are not also HEI directors) are presently eligible to participate in the Plan. 
 Shares Reserved for Issuance under the Plan.    The number of shares of HEI Common Stock originally reserved for issuance under the Plan was 300,000, subject to adjustment for certain changes in capitalization. As of the date hereof, 253,393 shares have been issued under the Plan, and accordingly 46,607 remain available for issuance. If this Proposal No. 3 is approved, the number of shares of HEI Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan would be increased by 300,000 shares. The shares to be issued under the Plan may, in whole or in part, be authorized but unissued shares of HEI Common Stock or shares that may be reacquired by HEI in the open markets in private transactions or otherwise. The closing price per share of HEI Common Stock on March 1, 2019 was $38.43. 
 Benefits Under the Plan.    The Plan provides for the grant of shares of HEI Common Stock (Stock Payments) to eligible nonemployee directors annually on the Grant Date, which will be each June 30 (or on the next preceding business day if June 30 is not a business day) or, in the case of a person who is elected or appointed to serve as a new director after June 30, on the date that such person first becomes a director. The amount of HEI Common Stock to be issued to nonemployee directors under the Plan may be expressed either as a specified number of shares or as a specified dollar value. If the Stock Payment is expressed as a dollar value, then the number of shares to be issued on the Grant Date is determined by dividing the specified dollar value by the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of a share of HEI Common Stock on the Grant Date, with any resulting fractional share to be paid in cash. 
Under current Plan provisions: Table of Contents
   PROPOSAL NO. 3: APPROVAL OF EXTENSION OF THE 2011 NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN   
entitled to an annual Stock Payment valued at $55,000. Only one Stock Payment is payable to any such director even if he or she serves as a director of both Hawaiian Electric Company and American Savings Bank. 
The amount of the Stock Payment to which participating nonemployee directors may be entitled, and whether the Stock Payment is expressed as a dollar value or in number of shares, may be changed in the discretion of the committee, subject to Board approval and without shareholder approval, but may not be changed more than once between annual meetings of shareholders. As discussed in "Director Compensation — Components of Director Compensation" on page 23 above, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, a maximum annual compensation limit of $600,000 for any nonemployee director. Participating nonemployee directors will recognize ordinary income equal to the value of the shares received and HEI (or its operating subsidiaries, as the case may be) will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in the same amount. 
 Shareholder Rights.    No participant in the Plan shall have any rights as an HEI shareholder with respect to any shares of HEI Common Stock except if and when such shares are issued. Recipients of Stock Payments shall have all the rights of a shareholder from and after the Grant Date with respect to the issued shares of HEI Common Stock granted. Once issued as a Stock Payment, the shares of HEI Common Stock thus granted are not subject to forfeiture. 
 Transferability of Rights.    No participant in the Plan may assign the right to receive any Stock Payment or any other right or interest under the Plan, contingent or otherwise, or cause or permit any encumbrance, pledge or charge of any nature to be imposed on any such right to receive a Stock Payment. Each participant is responsible for complying with all applicable federal and state securities and other applicable laws relating to participation in the Plan or the shares received as a Stock Payment. 
 Amendment or Termination of the Plan.    The Board in its discretion may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, no such amendment will, without approval of the shareholders of HEI, change the class of persons eligible to receive Stock Payments under the Plan (except for changing the subsidiaries whose nonemployee directors are eligible to participate in the Plan) or otherwise modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, or increase the total number of shares of HEI Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan (except for adjustment in the event of certain changes in capitalization). Moreover, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair or adversely affect any right or obligation under any Stock Payment previously granted under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, without further action by the shareholders of HEI, amend the Plan or modify the grants of stock under the Plan as described above under "Benefits Under the Plan" or in response to changes in securities or other laws, or rules, regulations or regulatory interpretations thereof, applicable to the Plan, or to comply with stock exchange rules or requirements. 
 Duration of the Plan.    If the extension of the term of the Plan is approved by shareholders at the Annual Meeting, it will expire February 14, 2029, unless earlier terminated by the Board. If this Proposal No. 3 is not approved by shareholders, the Plan will continue in effect under its existing terms until April 30, 2021, unless earlier terminated by the Board. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     New Plan Benefits   
[END TABLE]
The number of shares to be received by nonemployee directors under the Plan cannot be determined since the ultimate value of grants under the Plan depends on several factors, including the market value of HEI Common Stock, whether awards are denominated in dollar value or number of shares, the number of directors and the boards on which they serve and the level of future grants under the Plan. The level of benefits currently provided under the Plan is described above under "Benefits Under the Plan." Pursuant to grants made in 2018, 38,821 shares were granted to nonemployee directors.

   AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT    
  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of HEI's accounting functions and internal controls. It operates and acts under a written charter, which was adopted and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board and is available for review at www.hei.com/govdocs. The Board has determined that the three directors currently serving on the Audit Committee (Messrs. Dahl, Russell and Taniguchi) meet the independence and other qualification requirements of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and applicable securities laws. Messrs. Dahl, Russell and Taniguchi have also been determined by the Board to be "audit committee financial experts" on the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee has authority to retain its own independent legal counsel and accounting advisers at HEI's expense. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board with its financial and risk oversight responsibilities. Management has the primary responsibility for HEI's consolidated financial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal control. The independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility for expressing opinions on HEI's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on its integrated audits. 
      Independence of registered public accounting firm and recommendation to include financial statements in  Form 10-K       
In connection with its responsibilities, the Audit Committee held five regular meetings and no special meetings in 2018 with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte). In its meetings with management and Deloitte, the Audit Committee's review and discussion included the audited consolidated financial statements, audit plan and quality/adequacy of internal controls. Discussions with Deloitte included the matters required by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," such as the audit strategy and results of the audit. 
Deloitte provided the Audit Committee with written disclosures and a letter regarding its independence from management as required by professional standards and other regulatory requirements, including applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Based on its review of the disclosure statements and discussions with Deloitte, the Audit Committee satisfied itself as to the independence of the external auditor. 
Based on its reviews and discussions with management and Deloitte described above and review of Deloitte's representations and disclosures, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that HEI's audited consolidated financial statements be included in HEI's 2018 Form 10-K.

  PROPOSAL NO. 4: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, the shareholders will be asked to ratify the appointment of Deloitte as HEI's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and thereafter until its successor is appointed. Representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make statements if they desire to do so and to respond to appropriate questions. 
      Auditors' fees       
The following table sets forth the fees paid or payable to Deloitte, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 and 2017: 
Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee preapproves all audit and permitted nonaudit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee may delegate this responsibility to one or more of its members, provided that such member or members report any such preapprovals to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. All of the amounts set forth in the table above were preapproved. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the professional fees billed by Deloitte and determined that the provision of nonaudit services was compatible with the maintenance of the auditor's independence. 
In the event the appointment of Deloitte is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection, but may decide to maintain the appointment of Deloitte. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of HEI's shareholders.

     Electronic access to proxy materials   
[END TABLE]
HEI provides shareholders the option to access its proxy materials via the Internet. In keeping with our efforts to conserve natural resources, this method of delivery reduces the amount of paper necessary to produce these materials and reduces the costs associated with the printing and mailing of these materials to shareholders. On March 25, 2019, a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice) will be mailed to certain shareholders and our proxy materials will be posted on the website referenced in the Notice (www.ViewMaterial.com/HEI). As more fully described in the Notice, shareholders may choose to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or may request to receive a printed set of our proxy materials. The Notice and website will provide information regarding how to request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail on an ongoing basis. 
If you currently receive HEI's proxy materials in printed form and would like to receive them electronically in the future, please so indicate on the enclosed proxy, if voting by mail, or by following the instructions provided when using the telephone or Internet voting options described below.

     Shares outstanding and entitled to vote   
[END TABLE]
On March 1, 2019, 108,936,902 shares of HEI Common Stock were outstanding. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share held on the record date. The Bylaws of HEI do not provide for cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.

     Quorum requirements   
[END TABLE]
A quorum is needed to conduct business at the 2019 Annual Meeting. A majority of the shares of HEI Common Stock outstanding on March 1, 2019 and entitled to vote, and present in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting, constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and broker nonvotes of uninstructed shares on routine matters (such as ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm) will be counted in the number of shares present in person or by proxy for purposes of determining a quorum. A quorum established for one purpose will apply for all purposes at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

     Voting shares held in street name (e.g., through a broker, trustee or other holder of record)   
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" (that is, through a broker, trustee or other holder of record), you will receive a voting instruction card or other information from your broker or other holder of record seeking instruction from you as to how your shares should be voted. If you do not provide such instruction, your broker or nominee may vote your shares at its discretion on your behalf on routine matters, but not on nonroutine matters. The ratification of the appointment of HEI's independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter. The election of directors and the advisory vote on executive compensation, are considered nonroutine matters. Please provide instructions to your broker on how to vote your shares on all four proposals to ensure that your shares will be voted on all proposals in accordance with your wishes.
You may not vote shares held in "street name" at the 2019 Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your broker or holder of record.

Your shares will be voted according to your directions. 
For the HEI Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, all shares of stock for which no voting instructions are given will be voted as our Board recommends. For the HEI Retirement Savings Plan and the ASB 401(k) Plan, all shares of HEI Common Stock for which no voting instructions are given will be voted in the same proportion as the shares for which voting instructions were given.

     Vote requirements   
[END TABLE]
If a quorum is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, then:
In the event a director is elected under the plurality standard described above but does not receive the support of a majority of the votes cast, such director is required to submit his or her resignation to the Board for consideration. The Board would then analyze the shareholder concerns that drove the vote result and determine the most appropriate way to address those concerns, possibly by accepting the director's resignation. 
However, the Board and its Compensation Committee value input from shareholders and will consider the vote outcome when making future compensation decisions. Brokers may not vote on this proposal without your instruction because the advisory vote on executive compensation is considered a nonroutine matter. For the proposal to adopt a resolution approving the compensation of HEI's named executive officers, your options are to vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN."

     "Householding" and provision of additional copies of proxy materials upon request   
[END TABLE]
As permitted by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, HEI has adopted a procedure referred to as "householding," under which only one annual report to shareholders will be delivered to shareholders sharing the same address, unless contrary instructions are received. Householding reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household, the cost to HEI of preparing and mailing duplicate materials and the environmental burden of excess paper usage. Certain shareholder accounts at a householded address will continue to receive separate proxy statements and proxy cards, and we will also deliver promptly upon your written or oral request a separate copy of the annual report, proxy statement or Notice of Internet Availability if you are a security holder at a shared address to which a single copy of the requested documents was delivered. Dividend payments and account statements are not affected. Householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you notify us that you wish to receive a separate annual report. You will be removed from the householding program within 30 days after receipt of your notice. If you wish to commence or discontinue householding of the annual report to shareholders, you may notify us by calling us at (808) 532-5841 or toll free at (866) 672-5841 between 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time. You may also write to us at the following address: Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 730, Honolulu, Hawaii 96808-0730, or e-mail us at invest@hei.com. 
If you hold your shares in "street name," please contact your bank, broker or other holder of record to request information about householding.

   EXHIBIT A    
   EXHIBIT A          Reconciliation of GAAP1 to Non-GAAP Measures:          Reported Core Earnings and Other Financial Measures       
HEI uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of HEI and its subsidiaries. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information and are a better indicator of HEI's core operating activities. Core earnings and other financial measures as presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables provide a reconciliation of reported GAAP earnings to non-GAAP core earnings and the adjusted return on average common equity (ROACE) for HEI consolidated. 
The reconciling adjustment from GAAP earnings to core earnings for 2016 includes the merger termination fee received from the termination of the previously proposed merger between HEI and NextEra Energy and spin-off of ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii) and merger- and spin-off-related expenses (net of reimbursements), including expenses related to Hawaiian Electric's terminated liquefied natural gas (LNG) contract, which required PUC approval of the merger, and all merger- and spin-off-related tax impacts. The 2017 reconciling adjustments from GAAP earnings to core earnings exclude the impact of the federal tax reform act due to the adjustment of the deferred tax balances and the $1,000 employee bonuses paid by the bank related to federal tax reform. Management does not consider these items to be representative of the company's fundamental core earnings.

HEI reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, HEI's management may use certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of HEI and its subsidiaries for compensation purposes. Management believes these EICP and LTIP non-GAAP measures provide useful information and are a better indicator of management's performance regarding ongoing business operations for the purpose of measuring the level of achievement against the performance objectives underlying the EICP and LTIP programs established at the beginning of the measurement period. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures as presented below may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. The table below provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings to non-GAAP EICP and LTIP measures for HEI and its subsidiaries.

   HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, INC.   2011 NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN   (As Amended Effective February 14, 2019)         
1.     Purposes of the Plan  
The purposes of this Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. 2011 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan (the "Plan") are to advance the interests of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (the "Company") and its shareholders by aligning the personal interests of members of the Board of Directors of the Company and members of the boards of directors of its principal subsidiaries who are not employees with the interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Plan provides participating nonemployee directors with incentives to maintain their status as directors and improve the Company's performance by increasing the level of Common Stock of the Company owned by such nonemployee directors, thereby assisting them in meeting the Company's stock ownership guidelines, through the issuance of Common Stock under the Plan as part of their compensation. 
Upon the effective date of the Plan, the Company's 1990 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan, as last amended and restated on May 6, 2008 (the "Prior Plan"), shall terminate and no further shares of Common Stock of the Company shall thereafter be issued under the Prior Plan. 
2.    Definitions  
When used herein, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below: 
(a)  "Annual Meeting of Shareholders" means the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company at which directors of the Company are elected. 
(b)  "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company. 
(c)   "Committee" means the Compensation Committee of the Board, or subcommittee thereof, or such other committee appointed from time to time by the Board to administer the Plan in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof, which Committee shall consist of two or more "nonemployee directors" as defined under Rule 16b-3(b)(3)(i) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 
(d)  "Common Stock" means the common stock, without par value, of the Company. 
(e)   "Company" means Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc., a Hawaii corporation, and any successor corporation. 
(f)   "Employee" means any officer or employee of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliates (whether or not such subsidiary or affiliate participates in the Plan). 
(g)   "Fair Market Value" means, as of any given date: (i) the closing sale price of a share of Common Stock on such date on the national securities and exchange on which the Company's equity securities are principally listed or traded, or, if on such date no trade was conducted, the most recent preceding date on which there was such a trade; (ii) if the shares of Common Stock are then traded in an over-the-counter market, the average of the closing bid and asked prices for the shares of Common Stock in such over-the-counter market for the last preceding date on which there was a sale of such Common Stock in such market; or (iii) the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as otherwise determined by the Committee in the good faith exercise of its discretion. 
(h)  "Grant Date" shall be June 30 of each year except that (i) if June 30 falls on a day that is not a business day in Honolulu, Hawaii, then the Grant Date shall be the next preceding business day and (ii) the Grant Date for a person who first becomes a director after June 30 of a year and before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in the next year shall be the date on which such person's service as a director commences. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (ii) does not apply to a person who serves as a director of the Company or a Participating Company but then also (or instead) is elected or appointed to serve in another director position. 
(i)    "Nonemployee Company Director" means any person who is elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company and who is not an employee. 
(j)   "Nonemployee Participating Company Director" means any person who is elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of any one or more Participating Companies and who is not an Employee.

   Appendix A   
(k)   "Participant" means any Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company. 
(l)    "Participating Company" means any direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company whose participation in the Plan has been approved by the Board. 
(m) "Plan" means this 2011 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan, as it may be amended from time to time. 
(n)  "Stock Payment" means a grant under the Plan of shares of Common Stock to a Nonemployee Company Director or a Nonemployee Participating Company Director rather than cash as compensation for services rendered as a director of the Company or a Participating Company, as provided in Section 6 hereof. 
3.    Shares of Common Stock Subject to the Plan  
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 8 below, a total of 346,607 shares of Common Stock shall be reserved and available for issuance pursuant to grants under the Plan on or after the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, less one (1) share for every one (1) share, if any, granted under the Plan after December 31, 2018 and prior to the date of such Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Common Stock to be issued under the Plan may, in whole or in part, be authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock of the Company or shares that may be reacquired by the Company in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise. 
4.    Administration of the Plan  
(a)  The Plan will be administered by the Committee. The Company shall pay all costs of administration of the Plan. 
(b)  Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee has and may exercise such powers and authority of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate for the Committee to carry out its functions under the Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall have full power and authority (i) to determine all questions of fact that may arise under the Plan, (ii) to interpret the Plan and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, and (iii) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including, without limitation, any rules which the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to ensure that the Company, each Participating Company and the Plan will be able to comply with all applicable provisions of any federal, state or local law, including securities laws and laws relating to the withholding of tax. All interpretations, determinations, and actions by the Committee will be final, conclusive, and binding upon all parties. Any action of the Committee with respect to the administration of the Plan shall be taken pursuant to a majority vote at a meeting of the Committee (at which members may participate by telephone) or by the unanimous written consent of its members. 
(c)   Neither the Company, nor any Participating Company, nor any representatives, employees or agents of the Company or any Participating Company, nor any member of the Board or the Committee or any designee thereof will be liable for any damages resulting from any action or determination made by the Board or the Committee with respect to the Plan or any transaction arising under the Plan or any omission in connection with the Plan in the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
5.    Participation in the Plan  
(a)  All Nonemployee Company Directors and Nonemployee Participating Company Directors shall participate in the Plan, subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan, so long as they shall be a nonemployee director of the Company or a Participating Company on the Grant Date. 
(b)  Nonemployee Company Directors and Nonemployee Participating Company Directors shall be eligible for Stock Payments pursuant to the terms of Section 6 of the Plan. 
6.    Determination of Nonemployee Directors' Stock Payments  
(a)  Each Nonemployee Company Director and each Nonemployee Participating Company Director who serves in that capacity on the Grant Date shall receive, in addition to any annual retainer and other amounts that may be payable to such Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company Director, a Stock Payment; provided, however, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive more than one Stock Payment even if he or she serves as a director of both the Company and a Participating Company or more than one Participating Company and provided, further, that the Stock Payment for a new director whose Grant Date is determined pursuant to 
 C-2
Table of Contents
   Appendix A   
Section 2(h)(ii) shall be prorated based on a fraction in which the numerator is the number of days remaining between the date on which such Participant becomes a director and the date of the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the denominator is 365 days. 
(b)  Stock Payments may be designated in either dollar value or in a number of shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued to each Participant as a Stock Payment if the Stock Payment is designated by dollar value shall be determined by dividing the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date into the applicable dollar value of the Stock Payment, provided that no fractional shares shall be issued (cash shall be paid in lieu thereof). 
(c)   For Nonemployee Company Directors and Nonemployee Participating Company Directors serving in that capacity on the Grant Date, the Stock Payment shall be designated in dollar value as follows: (i) for Nonemployee Company Directors, $100,000 and (ii) for Nonemployee Participating Company Directors, $55,000. For a Nonemployee Company Director who also serves as a Nonemployee Participating Company Director on the Grant Date, the applicable dollar value of the Stock Payment will be $100,000. 
(d)  The amount of the Stock Payment, and whether it is expressed as a dollar value or in number of shares, may be changed in the discretion and upon recommendation of the Committee and approval by the Board, but shall not be changed more than once between any two Annual Meetings of Shareholders. 
(e)   No Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company Director shall be required to forfeit or otherwise return to the Company any shares of Common Stock issued to him or her as a Stock Payment pursuant to the Plan notwithstanding any change in status of such director which renders him or her ineligible to continue as a participant in the Plan after the Grant Date. 
7.    Shareholder Rights  
(a)  Nonemployee Company Directors and Nonemployee Participating Company Directors shall not be deemed for any purpose to be or have rights as shareholders of the Company with respect to any shares of Common Stock except as and when such shares are issued and then in any event not earlier than the Grant Date. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or distributions or other rights for which the record date precedes the Grant Date. 
(b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 7(a) above, Nonemployee Company Directors and Nonemployee Participating Company Directors will have all rights of a shareholder with respect to Common Stock once issued as a Stock Payment on the Grant Date, including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto. 
8.    Adjustment for Changes in Capitalization  
If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are increased, decreased, or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities, or if additional shares or new or different shares or other securities are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities, through merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the property of the Company, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares, rights offering, distribution of assets or other distribution with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities or other change in the corporate structure or shares of Common Stock, the maximum number of shares and/or the kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee. Any determination by the Committee as to any such adjustment will be final, binding, and conclusive. The maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan as a result of any such adjustment shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
9.    Continuation of Director or Other Status  
Nothing in the Plan or in any instrument executed pursuant to the Plan or any action taken pursuant to the Plan shall be construed as creating or constituting evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company or any other Participating Company, as the case may be, will retain a Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company Director as a director or in any other capacity for any period of time or at a particular retainer or other rate of compensation, as conferring upon any director any legal or other right to continue as a director or in any other capacity, or as limiting, interfering with or otherwise affecting any right of the Company or a Participating Company or their respective shareholders may have to terminate a director in his or her capacity as 
 C-3

   Appendix A    
a director or otherwise at any time for any reason, with or without cause, and without regard to the effect that such termination might have upon him or her as a participant under the Plan. 
10.  Compliance with Government Regulations  
Neither the Plan nor the Company shall be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan at any time unless and until all applicable requirements imposed by any federal and state securities and other laws, rules, and regulations, by any regulatory agencies or by any stock exchanges upon which the Common Stock may be listed have been fully met. As a condition precedent to any issuance of shares of Common Stock and delivery of notice of share ownership evidencing such shares pursuant to the Plan, the Board or the Committee may require a Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company Director to take any such action and to make any such covenants, agreements and representations as the Board or the Committee, as the case may be, in its discretion deems necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with such requirements. The Company may elect, but shall in no event be obligated, to register the shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter amended, or to qualify or register such shares under any securities laws of any state upon their issuance under the Plan or at any time thereafter, or to take any other action in order to cause the issuance and delivery of such shares under the Plan or any subsequent offer, sale or other transfer of such shares to comply with any such law, regulation or requirement. Nonemployee Company Directors and Nonemployee Participating Company Directors are responsible for complying with all applicable federal and state securities and other laws, rules and regulations in connection with any offer, sale or other transfer by them of the shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan or any interest therein including, without limitation, compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (unless an exemption therefrom is available), or with the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated thereunder, if available, or any successor provisions. 
11.   Nontransferability of Rights  
No Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company Director shall have the right to assign the right to receive any Stock Payment or any other right or interest under the Plan, contingent or otherwise, or to cause or permit any encumbrance, pledge or charge of any nature to be imposed on any such right to receive any Stock Payment (prior to the issuance of a stock certificate or notice of share ownership evidencing such Stock Payment, which the Company shall endeavor to cause to occur on the Grant Date or as soon as practicable thereafter). 
12.   Amendment and Termination of Plan  
(a)  The Board will have the power in its discretion, to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. No such amendment will, without approval of the shareholders of the Company: 
  (i)  Change the class of persons eligible to receive Stock Payments under the Plan or otherwise modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan; or 
 (ii)  Increase the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan (except for adjustments as provided in Section 8 hereof). 
(b)  No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan will, without the consent of the Nonemployee Company Director or Nonemployee Participating Company Director, alter, terminate, impair, or adversely affect any right or obligations under any Stock Payment previously granted under the Plan to such Participant, unless such amendment, suspension or termination is required by applicable law. 
(c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, without further action by the shareholders of the Company, amend the Plan or modify Stock Payments under the Plan (i) in response to changes in securities or other laws, or rules, regulations or regulatory interpretations thereof, applicable to the Plan, or (ii) to comply with stock exchange rules or requirements. 
13.   Governing Law  
The laws of the State of Hawaii shall govern and control the interpretation and application of the terms of the Plan.
