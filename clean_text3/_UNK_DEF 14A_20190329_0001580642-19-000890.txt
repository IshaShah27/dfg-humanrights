INTRODUCTION
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board" or the "Trustees") of Northern Lights Fund Trust (the "Trust") on behalf of Ladenburg Income Fund, Ladenburg Income & Growth Fund, Ladenburg Growth & Income Fund, Ladenburg Growth Fund and Ladenburg Aggressive Growth Fund (each a "Fund"  and together the "Funds"), for use at a special meeting of shareholders of the Trust (the "Meeting") to be held at the offices of the Trust's administrator, Gemini Fund Services, LLC, 80 Arkay Drive, Suite 110, Hauppauge, NY 11788, on March 29, 2019 at 10 AM, Eastern time, and at any and all adjournments thereof.

PROPOSAL I
APPROVAL OF A NEW INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE TRUST AND LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.
Background
The primary purpose of this proposal is to enable Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, Inc. ("LTAM" or the "Adviser") to continue to serve as the investment adviser to the Funds. Until approximately December 24, 2018, Dr. Philip Frost together with two entities controlled by him, Frost Gamma Investment Trust ("FGIT") and Frost Nevada Investments Trust ("FNIT" and, together with FGIT, the "Frost Trusts"), owned over 35% of the outstanding securities of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. ("LTFS"), the parent company of LTAM. On approximately December 24, 2018, LTFS engaged in a share repurchase and Dr. Frost made several charitable donations that together reduced his and the Frost Trusts' combined ownership stake in LTFS to less than 5% of the outstanding voting securities (the "Transaction").
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), a transaction that results in the transfer of a block of more than 25% of the voting interests of an investment adviser is presumed to constitute an "assignment" of the adviser. The 1940 Act further states that an assignment of an investment adviser causes the adviser's investment advisory agreement to be "assigned," which results in the automatic termination of the agreement by the agreement's terms as required by the 1940 Act. Because the Transaction, as described above, may have resulted in an assignment of LTAM, we are seeking shareholder approval of a new advisory agreement between the Trust and the LTAM with respect to the Funds (the "New Agreement"). LTAM has served as investment adviser to the Funds pursuant to an advisory agreement (the "Current Agreement") since the Funds commenced operations on August 24, 2015. LTAM believes the Transaction will not result in any interruption or decrease in the quality of services provided by LTAM. Philip Blancato has served as portfolio manager for each Fund since its inception and will continue to serve as portfolio manager under the New Agreement. There will be no changes to any Fund's investment objectives, principal strategies or risks.
The New Agreement will be identical in all material respects to the Current Agreement, except that its date of execution, effectiveness and expiration are changed. The fees to be charged under the New Agreement are identical to the fees charged under the Current Agreement. The effective date of the New Agreement for each Fund will be the date that the respective Fund's shareholders approve the New Agreement (the "Effective Date").
At a meeting on January 29, 2019 (the "Board Meeting"), the Board approved the New Agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and LTAM, subject to shareholder approval. The 1940 Act requires that investment advisory agreements such as the New Agreement be approved by a vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of each Fund. Therefore, shareholders are being asked to approve the proposed New Agreement with LTAM.
Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act
The parties to the Transaction intend to rely on Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, which provides a non-exclusive safe harbor whereby an investment adviser (such as LTAM) to an investment company (such as the Funds) or an affiliate of such investment adviser may receive payment or benefit in connection with the sale of an interest in the investment adviser if two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that during the three-year period following the Transaction, at least 75% of the investment company's board must not be "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the investment adviser or its predecessor. The Board currently meets this requirement as all of the Trustees are independent and will continue to be independent for the period required. Second, no "unfair burden" can be imposed on the investment company as a result of the Transaction. An "unfair burden" includes: any arrangement during the two-year period after the Transaction where the investment adviser (or predecessor or successor adviser), or any of its "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act), receive or are entitled to receive any compensation, directly or indirectly, (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from or on behalf of the investment company (other than bona fide ordinary compensation as principal underwriter for the investment company), or (ii) from the investment company or its shareholders (other than fees for bona fide investment advisory or other services). The Board determined that there was no "unfair burden" imposed as a result of the Transaction, and the Trust will ensure that this condition will continue to be satisfied for the required time period.
The Advisory Agreement 
The Board, including a majority of the Trustees who are not "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of the Trust or LTAM ("Independent Trustees"), originally approved the Current Agreement, dated March 25, 2015, at a meeting held on March 25, 2015 with respect to Funds. The Board most recently renewed the Current Agreement with respect to the Funds at a meeting held on May 21-22, 2018. Under the terms of the Current Agreement and the New Agreement, LTAM is entitled to receive an annual fee from each Fund equal to 0.50% of the Fund's average daily net assets. For such compensation, LTAM, at its expense, pays the salaries, expenses and fees of the officers, Trustees and employees of the Trust who are officers, directors, members or employees of LTAM. Additionally, LTAM continuously furnishes an investment program for each Fund, makes investment decisions on behalf of each Fund, and places all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, subject to each Fund's investment objectives, policies, and restrictions and such policies as the Trustees may determine. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, LTAM received advisory fees from each Fund as follows:
LTAM has contractually agreed to reduce its fees and/or absorb expenses of each Fund, until at least October 31, 2019, so that the total annual operating expenses (exclusive of any front-end or contingent deferred loads; brokerage fees and commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses; fees and expenses associated with investments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example option and swap fees and expenses); borrowing costs (such as interest and dividend expense on securities sold short); taxes; and extraordinary expenses, such as litigation expenses (which may include indemnification of Fund officers and Trustees, contractual indemnification of Fund service providers (other than the adviser)) of a Fund do not exceed 1.00%, 1.75% and 0.75% of each Fund's average daily net assets attributable to each Fund's Class A, Class C and Class I shares, respectively. Any waiver or reimbursement by LTAM is subject to possible recoupment from a Fund in future years, within the three years after the fees have been waived or reimbursed, if such recoupment can be achieved within the lesser of (1) the expense cap limitation at time of waiver; or (2) the expense cap limitation at the time of recoupment. If the New Agreement is approved by shareholders, LTAM will agree to an expense limitation agreement with identical terms.
With respect to each Fund, the New Agreement will continue in force for an initial period of two years from the Effective Date, and from year to year thereafter, but only so long as its continuance is approved at least annually by (i) the Board or (ii) a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund, provided that in either event continuance is also approved by a majority of the Independent Trustees, by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting such approval. As with the Current Agreement, the New Agreement automatically terminates on assignment and may be terminated upon 60 days' notice by either LTAM or a Fund. In the case of termination by a Fund, the action must be authorized (i) by resolution of the Board, including the vote or written consent of the Trustees who are not parties to the (New or Current) Agreement or interested persons of either party to thereto, or (ii) by vote of majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
The New Agreement, like the Current Agreement, provides that LTAM shall not be subject to any liability in connection with the performance of its services thereunder in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties.
Subject to shareholder approval, the Trust will enter into the New Agreement with LTAM. If the New Agreement with LTAM is not approved by shareholders with respect to a particular Fund or Funds, the Board and LTAM will consider other options, including a new or modified request for shareholder approval of the New Agreement.
The New Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You should read the New Agreement. The description in this Proxy Statement of the New Agreement is only a summary.
Information Concerning LTAM
LTAM is a New York corporation located at 277 Park Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10172. The names, addresses and principal occupations of the principal executive officers and directors of LTAM as of the date of this Proxy Statement are set forth below:
*The address of each principal executive officer and director listed is c/o Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, Inc., 277 Park Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, NY 10172.
LTAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company LTFS, which is located at 440 Biscayne Boulevard, 12th Floor, Miami, Florida 33137. LTFS owns 100% of the outstanding voting securities of LTAM.
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, each Fund paid brokerage commissions to Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. ("LTCO") as follows:
Evaluation by the Board of Trustees 
At the Board Meeting, the Trustees considered the approval of the New Agreement. The Trustees were assisted by independent legal counsel and fund counsel throughout the agreement review process. The Trustees relied upon the advice of independent legal counsel and fund counsel, and their own business judgment in determining the material factors to be considered in evaluating the New Agreement and the weight to be given to each such factor. The conclusions reached by the Trustees were based on a comprehensive evaluation of all of the information provided and were not the result of any one factor. Moreover, each Trustee may have afforded different weight to the various factors in reaching his conclusions with respect to the New Agreement.
Nature, Extent & Quality of Services. The Trustees noted that LTAM was established in 1982 as a subsidiary of Ladenburg Financial Services, Inc., a full-service financial company founded in 1876, and that as of December 31, 2018, LTAM managed $2.346 billion in assets offering a full complement of financial services including investment consulting, diversified investment solutions and personalized investment strategies to a wide range of clients including individuals, families, foundations, endowments, retirement plans and profit sharing plans. The Trustees reviewed the background information of the Adviser's key investment personnel, taking into consideration their education and the team's diverse financial industry experience, which covers research and analysis, investment due diligence, fund selection and asset allocation. The Board discussed the Adviser's investment process and noted that the Adviser utilized an investment committee to support its portfolio manager with fundamental research, sourced internally and externally, and due diligence on the macro-economy and exchange traded funds of varying asset classes that meet the risk-adjusted return requirements of each Fund. The Trustees considered LTAM's risk management processes and its dedicated resources to monitor concentration, liquidity, asset class diversification and sell targets. The Board noted that LTAM used an affiliated broker-dealer at industry competitive commission rates. The Board noted that the Adviser reported no direct compliance or litigation issues during the past year, rather, the legal issues that resulted in the change of control were against a large stockholder of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, which owns LTAM. The Board noted that LTAM did not anticipate any changes in service level due to the change of ownership. The Board acknowledged LTAM's deep staff, product expertise and the continuous research required to execute the strategies and that LTAM would continue to have resources available from its parent company. After further discussion, the Trustees concluded that the change of ownership would likely not have any negative effect on the nature, extent and quality of service provided by LTAM and that LTAM was expected to continue to provide the same level of high quality service to the Funds for the benefit of shareholders.
Performance.
Ladenburg Aggressive. The Trustees noted that for the one-year, three-year and since inception periods ended December 31, 2018, the Fund had net returns of -9.42%, +5.70% and +4.61%, respectively, which slightly outperformed the Fund's blended benchmark over the three-year period, but lagged the benchmark's one-year and inception-to-date returns. The Trustees observed that the Fund's one-year performance placed it in the 56th percentile relative to its peer group and the Morningstar category. However, the Trustees acknowledged that, while negative, the Fund's Sharpe ratio placed it in the 45th percentile relative to its peers and that the Fund's Sortino ratio placed it in the 34th percentile relative to its peers. The Board considered the Fund's strong relative longer-term. The Trustees reasoned that the Fund's objective was to maximize long-term capital growth as part of a broader asset allocation strategy and that despite the Fund's short-term underperformance, shareholders could benefit by achieving aggressive growth at lower levels of volatility.
Ladenburg Growth. The Trustees noted that the Fund had a net return of -8.33% for the year ended December 31, 2018, placing it in the 59th percentile relative to its peers, and the 66th percentile relative to the category. The Trustees further noted that the Fund underperformed its blended benchmark, which returned -7.32% over the same period. They considered that since inception, the Fund had underperformed its benchmark, Morningstar category and peer group median. The Trustees also considered the Fund's risk metrics and noted that the Fund's Sharpe and Sortino ratios had improved with a 50th and 42nd percentile, respectively, relative to its peer group, and a 66th and 58th percentile, respectively, relative to the category. The Trustees noted that the recent statistics were material improvements relative to the Fund's three-year and since inception Sharpe and Sortino ratios.
Ladenburg Growth & Income. Trustees noted that the Fund had a net return of -7.27% for the year ended December 31, 2018, placing it in the 73rd and 74th percentile, respectively, relative to its peers and the category. The Trustees further noted that the Fund underperformed its blended benchmark, which returned -5.86% over the same period. They noted that since inception, the Fund had underperformed its benchmark, Morningstar category and peer group median. The Trustees considered the Fund's risk metrics and noted that while the Fund's Sortino and Sharpe ratios were negative, both ratios had improved relative to the Fund's three-year Sortino and Sharpe ratios.
Ladenburg Income & Growth. The Trustees noted that the Fund had a net return of -5.04% for the year ended December 31, 2018, placing it in the 50th percentile relative to its peers, and the 71st percentile relative to the category. The Trustees further noted that the Fund underperformed its blended benchmark, which returned -3.96% over the same period. The Trustees considered the Fund's risk metrics and noted that while the Fund's Sortino and Sharpe ratios were negative, both ratios had significantly improved. The Trustees noted that the recent statistics were material improvements relative to the Fund's three-year Sortino and Sharpe ratios demonstrating the Adviser's focus on risk management.
Ladenburg Income. The Trustees noted that, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund had a net return of -3.64%, placing the Fund at the 89th and 76th percentile relative to its peer group and category, respectively. The Trustees noted that the Fund underperformed its blended benchmark over each of the one-year (-3.64% vs. -2.16%), three-year (2.58% vs. 2.83%) and since inception (1.70% vs. 2.59%) periods. The Trustees noted that over the same period, the Fund's standard deviation was in the 78th and 71st percentile relative to its peer group and category, respectively. The Trustees reviewed the Sharpe and Sortino ratios relative to its peers and the category, noting that despite a slight year-to-date improvement versus its peers and the category relative to its one and three-year numbers, the Adviser could place more emphasis on risk management for the Fund.
With respect to the performance of each Fund, the Trustees discussed each Fund's investment objective and strategy. The Trustees noted that each Fund's strategy was based on diversification as a way to mitigate risk. The Board considered the observation of the Funds' portfolio manager that market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2018 were unusual in that diversification did not help performance, and that each Fund's fourth quarter 2018 results negatively skewed the year's overall return. The Board also considered the portfolio manager's explanation that the Adviser consistently monitors correlations and expected to provide shareholders better results when these unusual conditions abated. In addition, the Board considered the Adviser's position that each Fund's long-term performance statistics were negatively impacted by the initially low asset size of the Funds, which limited the Adviser's ability to implement each Fund's strategy. After further consideration of all factors, including the independent performance data provided by
Broadridge that showed long term positive returns, the Trustees concluded that each Fund's performance was adequate and consistent with its respective investment objectives.
Fees and Expenses.
The Trustees considered the Fund's advisory fee, noting that the advisory fee of 0.50% was higher than both its peer group and category medians, but well within the ranges of both comparison groups. They further noted that the Fund's net expense ratio of 0.93% was equal to the category median and slightly higher than the peer group median.
Ladenburg Growth. The Trustees considered the Fund's advisory fee, noting that the advisory fee of 0.50% was higher than its peer group and category medians, but within the range of both comparison groups and well below the category high of 1.75%. They further noted that the Fund's net expense ratio of 0.98% was higher than the peer group median and the category median of 0.94% and 0.85%, respectively.
Ladenburg Growth & Income. The Trustees considered the Fund's advisory fee, noting that the advisory fee of 0.50% was significantly higher than the median of its peer group (0.18%) and the category median (0.20%). The Trustees further noted that the Fund's net expense ratio of 0.98% was higher the peer group median and the category median of 0.80% and 0.74%, respectively.
Ladenburg Income & Growth. The Trustees considered the Fund's advisory fee, noting that the advisory fee of 0.50% was higher than the medians of both its peer group (0.15%) and category (0.30%), but well below the peer and category highs of 1.45%. They further noted that the Fund's net expense ratio of 1.02% was equal to the peer group median, but higher than the category median of 0.72%.
Ladenburg Income. The Trustees considered the Fund's advisory fee, noting that the advisory fee of 0.50% was significantly higher than the peer group median (0.14%) and category median (0.35%), and was within the range of the category, but tied with the peer group high of 0.50%. They further noted that the Fund's net expense ratio of 1.04% was higher than the peer group median (0.71%) and category median (0.66%), but within the range for both the peer group and category.
With respect to advisory fee comparisons, the Board noted that a meaningful number of each Fund's peers and Morningstar category funds listed advisory fees of 0.0%, which skewed both the peer group and category averages and medians. The Board also noted that funds within each peer group and category generally had higher assets and, therefore, were more likely than the Funds to have achieved economies of scale, and that the Adviser expected each Fund to achieve its own economies of scale through asset growth. The Trustees considered the Adviser's willingness to renew each Fund's expense limitation agreement. After discussion, the Trustees concluded that each Fund's advisory fee was not unreasonable.
Economies of Scale. The Trustees considered whether economies of scale had been reached with respect to the advisory services provided to each Fund. They noted that the Adviser had indicated its willingness to discuss breakpoints with the Trustees as each Fund grows to $250 million in assets, and anticipated realizing economies of scale once each Fund reached significantly greater assets. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Trustees that based on the current size of the Funds, the matter of economies of scale would be revisited at the next renewal of the New Agreement and as each of the Fund's size increases.
Profitability. The Trustees reviewed the profitability analysis provided by the Adviser for each of the Funds. They noted that the Adviser reported that it realized over the last year a modest profit from its relationship with Ladenburg Growth & Income, but a loss with respect to each of the other Funds. The Trustees reviewed projected pro-forma profit analysis for the first two years of the New Agreement, which indicated that the Adviser was not expected to realize any meaningful level of profit during the initial term of the New Agreement due to the limited estimated growth of each Fund. After discussion, they concluded that excessive profitability was not a concern at this time.
Conclusion. Having requested and received such information from the adviser as the Trustees believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the New Agreement, and as assisted by the advice of counsel, the Trustees concluded that the advisory fee structure was not unreasonable and that approval of the New Agreement was in the best interests of the shareholders of Ladenburg Aggressive, Ladenburg Growth, Ladenburg Growth & Income, Ladenburg Income & Growth, and Ladenburg Income Funds.
The Board, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of each Fund vote "FOR" approval of the New Agreement.
PROPOSAL II
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT OF ACCRUED BUT UNPAID ADVISORY FEES TO LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.
Since the date of the Transaction, fees that would have been paid to LTAM as adviser to each of the Funds have been withheld pending shareholder approval of the payment of the withheld fees to LTAM. LTAM's advisory fees have been accrued at its current investment advisory expense equal to an annual fee of 0.50% of each Fund's average daily net assets, subject to any required waivers pursuant to LTAM's expense limitation agreement, and withheld since December 24, 2018. As of February 4, 2019, the fees withheld from LTAM, with respect to each Fund, are as follows:
In connection with the approval of the New Agreement, the Trustees are requesting that shareholders approve the payment to LTAM of the investment advisory fees for LTAM's service to the Funds from December 24, 2018 until the New Agreement is approved by shareholders. Approval of payment to LTAM for its service as the investment adviser to the Funds since December 24, 2018 will not raise the fees paid by the Funds or the Funds' shareholders.
Evaluation by the Board of Trustees
At the Board Meeting, the Board discussed the appropriateness of ratifying the payment of fees accrued but withheld under the Current Agreement since December 24, 2018. The Board considered that LTAM had continued to manage the Funds with the same amount of resources and expertise as it had since the inception of each Fund. The Board noted that there had been no interruption in LTAM's management of the Funds since the date of the Transaction and that the Transaction did not appear to have had any effect on how LTAM managed the Funds. The Board further noted it would be unfair to LTAM to have to forfeit the accrued advisory fees and that the shareholders should not unjustly benefit from LTAM's management of each Fund's assets without paying for such services. Accordingly, the Trustees concluded that it was appropriate that any advisory fees withheld from LTAM, with respect to each Fund, since December 24, 2018 until the date on which the New Agreement is approved by each Fund's shareholders be paid to LTAM. In light of the fact that the Transaction may have resulted in the assignment of LTAM, and thus the Current Agreement as well, the Trustees considered that withholding payment of advisory fees to LTAM was reasonable.
The Board, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of the Funds vote "FOR" approval of the payment of amounts withheld to LTAM for its service to the Funds since December 24, 2018.
OTHER INFORMATION
OPERATION OF THE FUND
Each Fund is a diversified series of Northern Lights Fund Trust, an open-end investment management company organized as a Delaware statutory trust and formed by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust on January 19, 2005. The Trust's principal executive offices are located at 17605 Wright Street, Suite 2, Omaha, Nebraska 68130. The Board supervises the business activities of the Funds. Like other mutual funds, the Funds retain various organizations to perform specialized services. The Funds currently retain LTAM as investment adviser. LTCO, located at 277 Park Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10172, serves as principal underwriter and distributor of the Funds. Gemini Fund Services, LLC, with principal offices located at 17605 Wright Street, Suite 2, Omaha, Nebraska 68130 provides the Funds with transfer agent, accounting, compliance, and administrative services.  
THE PROXY
The Board solicits proxies so that each shareholder has the opportunity to vote on the proposals to be considered at the Meeting. A proxy for voting your shares at the Meeting is enclosed. The shares represented by each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the Meeting as specified. If no specification is made, the shares represented by a duly and timely executed proxy will be voted for approval of the proposed New Agreement, the payment of accrued but unpaid advisory fees to LTAM, and at the discretion of the holders of the proxy on any other matter that may come before the Meeting that the Trust did not have notice of a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (i) submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, (ii) submitting a written notice to the President of the Trust revoking the proxy, or (iii) attending and voting in person at the Meeting.
VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTING
As of the Record Date, the following numbers of shares of beneficial interest of each Fund were issued and outstanding:
All shareholders of record of the Funds on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Meeting on Proposals I and II.  Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately with respect to their share in each Fund. Each shareholder is entitled to one (1) vote per share held, and fractional votes for fractional shares held, on any matter submitted to a vote at the Meeting.
For each Fund, an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund is required for the approval of Proposals I and II. As defined in the 1940 Act, a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund means the vote of (i) 67% or more of the voting shares of the Fund present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the Fund, whichever is less.
Broker non-votes and abstentions will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum and the number of shares of each Fund represented at the Meeting, but they are not affirmative votes for any proposal. As a result, with respect to approval of Proposals I and II, non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposals because the required vote is a percentage of the shares present or outstanding.
Security Ownership of Management AND Certain Beneficial Owners
To the best knowledge of the Trust, as a group, the Trustees and officers of the Trust owned no shares of any of the Funds as of the Record Date.
As of the Record Date, the following shareholders of record owned 5% or more of the outstanding shares of each Fund:
FBO/Our Customers
P.O. Box 2226
Omaha, NE 68103
Shareholders owning more than 25% of the shares of a Fund are considered to "control" the Fund, as that term is defined under the 1940 Act. Persons controlling a Fund can determine the outcome of any proposal submitted to the shareholders for approval.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
The Trust has not received any shareholder proposals to be considered for presentation at the Meeting. Under the proxy rules of the SEC, shareholder proposals may, under certain conditions, be included in the Trust's Proxy Statement and proxy for a particular meeting. Under these rules, proposals submitted for inclusion in the Trust's proxy materials must be received by the Trust within a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. The fact that the Trust receives a shareholder proposal in a timely manner does not ensure its inclusion in its proxy materials, because there are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion. You should be aware that annual meetings of shareholders are not required as long as there is no particular requirement under the 1940 Act, which must be met by convening such a shareholder meeting. Any shareholder proposal should be sent to Kevin Wolf, President, Northern Lights Fund Trust, 80 Arkay Drive, Suite 110, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Shareholder proposals may also be raised from the floor at the Meeting without prior notice to the Trust.
COST OF SOLICITATION
The Board of Trustees is making this solicitation of proxies. The Trust has engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., a proxy solicitation firm (the "Proxy Solicitor"), to assist in the solicitation. The estimated fees anticipated to be paid to the Proxy Solicitor are approximately $56,418. The cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and proxy and any additional materials relating to the Meeting and the cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by LTAM. In addition to solicitation by mail, the Trust will request the insurance companies, banks, brokers and other custodial nominees and fiduciaries, to supply proxy materials to the respective beneficial owners of shares of a Fund of whom they have knowledge, and LTAM will reimburse them for their expenses in so doing. Certain officers, employees and agents of the Trust and LTAM may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, facsimile transmission, or mail, for which they will not receive any special compensation.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board knows of no other matters to be presented at the Meeting other than as set forth above. If any other matters properly come before the Meeting that the Trust did not have notice of a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement, the holders of the proxy will vote the shares represented by the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment, and discretionary authority to do so is included in the proxy.
PROXY DELIVERY
If you and another shareholder share the same address, the Trust may only send one Proxy Statement unless you or the other shareholder(s) request otherwise. Call or write to the Trust if you wish to receive a separate copy of the Proxy Statement, and the Trust will promptly mail a copy to you. You may also call or write to the Trust if you wish to receive a separate proxy in the future or if you are receiving multiple copies now and wish to receive a single copy in the future. For such requests, call the Trust at 1-631-470-2600, or write the Trust at 80 Arkay Drive, Suite 110, Hauppauge, NY 11788.

6. Reports to Adviser.
The Trust shall furnish or otherwise make available to the Adviser such copies of each Fund's Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, financial statements, proxy statements, reports and other information relating to its business and affairs as the Adviser may, at any time or from time to time, reasonably require in order to discharge its obligations under this Agreement.

Within 45 days of the last calendar quarter of each year while this Agreement is in effect, the Adviser will provide to the Board of Trustees of the Trust a written report that describes any issues arising under the code of ethics since the last report to the Board of Trustees, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the code and sanctions imposed in response to the material violations; and which certifies that the Adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent "access persons" (as that term is defined in Rule 17j-1) from violating the code.

In addition, the Adviser shall not seek satisfaction of any such obligations from the Trustees or any individual Trustee. The Adviser understands that the rights and obligations of any Fund under the Declaration of Trust are separate and distinct from those of any and all other Funds. The Adviser further understands and agrees that no Fund of the Trust shall be liable for any claims against any other Fund of the Trust and that the Adviser must look solely to the assets of the pertinent Fund of the Trust for the enforcement or satisfaction of any claims against the Trust with respect to that Fund.
18. Confidentiality.
The Adviser agrees to treat all records and other information relating to the Trust and the securities holdings of the Funds as confidential and shall not disclose any such records or information to any other person unless (i) the Board of Trustees of the Trust has approved the disclosure or (ii) such disclosure is compelled by law.
