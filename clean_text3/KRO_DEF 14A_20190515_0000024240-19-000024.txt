· a proxy card or voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
We are not incorporating the 2018 annual report into this proxy statement and you should not consider the       annual report as proxy solicitation material.  The accompanying notice of annual meeting of stockholders sets forth the time, place and purposes of the meeting.  Our principal executive offices are located at Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway,       Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas 75240‑2697.
Please refer to the Glossary of Terms on page ii for the definitions of certain terms       used in this proxy statement.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the purpose of the annual meeting?  
A:  At the annual meeting, stockholders will vote on the following, as described in this proxy statement:  
· Proposal 1 – the election of the seven director nominees named in this proxy statement; and  
· Proposal 2 – the adoption of a nonbinding advisory resolution that approves the named executive officer compensation                  described in this proxy statement (Say-on-Pay).  
[END TABLE]
In addition, stockholders will vote on any other matter that may properly come before the meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How does the board recommend that I vote?  
A:  The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR:  
· the election of each of the nominees for director named in this proxy statement; and  
· the approval and adoption of proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay).  
Q:  Who is allowed to vote at the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The board of directors has set the close of business on March 18, 2019 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to                    vote at the meeting.  Only holders of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote at the meeting.  On the record date, 115,907,698 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding.  Each                    share of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote.  
Q:  Why did I receive a notice regarding the internet availability                      of proxy materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials?  
A:  Pursuant to the SEC notice and access rules we furnish proxy materials                    over the internet to both our stockholders of record and our stockholders who hold our common stock through a brokerage firm or other nominee.  We                    believe that taking advantage of these rules expedites our stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, while also lowering the costs associated with conducting our annual meeting.  You can find instructions on how to access and review the                    proxy materials, and how to vote over the internet, on the notice of internet availability of proxy materials that you received.  The notice also contains                      instructions on how you can receive a paper copy of this proxy statement, our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders and a voting instruction form or proxy card.  
Q:  How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?  
A:  If you hold shares of our common stock in your name in certificate form or electronically with our transfer agent, Computershare, and not through a brokerage                    firm or other nominee, you are a stockholder of record.  As a stockholder of record, you may:  
· vote over the internet at www.aalvote.com/KRO;  
· vote by telephone using the voting procedures set forth on your proxy card;  
· instruct the agents named on your proxy card how to vote your shares by completing, signing and mailing the proxy                  card in the envelope provided; or  
· vote in person at the annual meeting.  
Q:  What are the consequences if I am a stockholder of record and I execute my proxy card but do not indicate how I would like my shares voted                    for one or more of the director nominees named in this proxy statement or proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay)?  
A:  If you are a stockholder of record the agents named on your proxy card will vote your shares on such uninstructed nominee or proposal as recommended by the                    board of directors in this proxy statement.  
Q:  How do I vote if my shares are held through a brokerage firm or other nominee?  
A:  If you hold your shares through a brokerage firm or other nominee, you must follow                      the instructions on your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or on your voting instruction form, on how to vote your shares.  In order to ensure your brokerage firm or other nominee votes your shares in the manner you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm or other nominee by the deadline provided                      on your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
Brokerage firms or other nominees may not vote your shares on the election of a director nominee or proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay) in the absence of your specific instructions as to how to vote.  We encourage you to provide instructions to your brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting         of your shares.  If you do not instruct your brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote with respect to the election of a director nominee or proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), your         brokerage firm or other nominee may not vote with respect to the election of such director nominee or on proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay) and your vote will be counted as a "broker/nominee non-vote."  "Broker/nominee non-votes" are non-votes by a brokerage firm or other nominee for shares held in a client's account for which the brokerage firm or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on a         particular matter and has not received instructions from the client.  How we treat broker/nominee non-votes is separately described in each of the answers below regarding what constitutes a quorum and the requisite votes necessary to elect a         director nominee or approve proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay).
- 2 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  If I hold my shares through a brokerage firm or other nominee, how may I vote in person at the annual meeting?  
A:  If you wish to vote in person at the annual meeting, you will need to follow the                      instructions on your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or voting instruction form on how to obtain the appropriate documents to vote in person at the meeting.  
Q:  Who will count the votes?  
A:  The board of directors has appointed Alliance Advisors to ascertain the number of shares represented, tabulate the vote and serve as inspector of election for                    the meeting.  
Q:  Is my vote confidential?  
A:  Yes.  All proxy cards, ballots or voting instructions will be kept confidential in accordance with our bylaws.  
Q:  How do I change or revoke my proxy instructions if I am a stockholder of record?  
A:  If you are a stockholder of record, you may change or revoke your proxy instructions in any of the following ways:  
· delivering to Alliance Advisors a written revocation;  
· submitting another proxy card bearing a later date;  
· changing your vote on www.aalvote.com/KRO;  
· using the telephone voting procedures set forth on your proxy card; or  
· voting in person at the annual meeting.  
Q:  How do I change or revoke my voting instructions if my shares are held through a brokerage firm or other nominee?  
A:  If your shares are held through a brokerage firm or other nominee, you must follow the instructions from your brokerage firm or other nominee on how to change                    or revoke your voting instructions or how to vote in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What constitutes a quorum?  
A:  A quorum is the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Shares that are voted         "abstain" or "withheld" are counted as present and entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.
As already discussed in the         previous answer regarding how to vote shares held through a brokerage firm or other nominee, there are no proposals for the 2019 annual meeting that would allow a         brokerage firm or nominee to vote uninstructed shares.  If a brokerage firm or other nominee receives no instruction for the election of any director nominee and receives no instruction for proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), such uninstructed shares will be counted as not entitled to vote and are, therefore, not considered for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.  If a         brokerage firm or other nominee receives instructions on the election of at least one director nominee or on proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), such instructed shares will         be counted as present and entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.
Together, Valhi and NLKW held approximately 80.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the       record date.  Valhi and NLKW have each indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the meeting.  If Valhi alone attends the meeting in person or by proxy, the meeting will have a quorum present.
- 3 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Assuming a quorum is present, what vote is required to elect a director nominee?  
A:  A plurality of affirmative votes of the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock represented and entitled to vote at the meeting is necessary to elect                    each director nominee.  You may indicate on your proxy card or in your voting instructions that you desire to withhold authority to vote for any of the director nominees.  Since director nominees need only receive a plurality of                    affirmative votes from the holders represented and entitled to vote at the meeting to be elected, a vote withheld or a broker/nominee non-vote regarding a particular nominee will not affect the election of such director nominee.  
[END TABLE]
Valhi and NLKW have each indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the       meeting and to vote such shares FOR the election of each of the director nominees named in this proxy statement.  If Valhi alone attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the stockholders will elect all of the nominees named       in this proxy statement to the board of directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Assuming a quorum is present, what vote is required to adopt and approve proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay)?  
A:  The stockholder resolution contained in this proposal provides that the nonbinding                    affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the requisite vote to adopt the resolution and approve the compensation of our named executive officers as such compensation is disclosed in this proxy statement.  Abstentions will be counted as                      represented and entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.  Broker/nominee non-votes will not be counted as entitled to vote and will have no effect on this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
Valhi and NLKW have each indicated its intention to have its shares of our common stock represented at the       meeting and to vote such shares FOR this nonbinding advisory proposal.  If Valhi alone attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the stockholders will, by a nonbinding advisory vote, approve this proposal.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Assuming a quorum is present, what vote is required to approve any other matter to come before the meeting?  
A:  Except as applicable laws may otherwise provide, the approval of any other matter that may properly come before the meeting will require the affirmative votes                    of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting.  Abstentions will be counted as represented and                      entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  If I am a stockholder of record, how will the agents named on my proxy card vote on any other matter to come before the meeting?  
A:  If you are a stockholder of record and to the extent allowed by applicable law, the agents named on your proxy card will vote in their discretion on any other                    matter that may properly come before the meeting.  
Q:  Who will pay for the cost of soliciting the proxies?  
A:  We will pay all expenses related to the solicitation, including charges for preparing, printing, assembling and distributing all materials delivered to                    stockholders.  In addition to the solicitation by mail, our directors, officers and regular employees may solicit proxies by telephone or in person for which such persons will receive no additional compensation.  Upon request, we will                    reimburse brokerage firms or other nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in distributing proxy materials and voting instruction forms to the beneficial owners of our common stock that hold such stock in accounts                    with such entities.

Valhi is the direct holder of approximately 82.9% of the outstanding shares of NL common stock as of the record       date.

If Valhi alone attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the meeting will have a quorum present and the stockholders will elect all of the nominees named in this proxy statement to the board of directors and       approve proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay).

Michael S. Simmons will also become vice president and chief accounting officer of Valhi effective as of June 1, 2019.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Controlled Company Status, Director Independence and Committees.  Because of Valhi's direct and indirect ownership of approximately 80.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, we are considered a controlled company under       the listing standards of the NYSE.  Pursuant to the listing standards, a controlled company may choose not to have a majority of independent directors, independent compensation, nominations or corporate governance committees or charters for these       committees.  While we currently have a majority of independent directors, we have chosen not to have an independent nominations or corporate governance committee or charters for these committees.  Our board of directors believes that the full board       of directors best represents the interests of all of our stockholders and that it is appropriate for all matters that would otherwise be considered by a nominations, corporate governance or risk oversight committee to be considered and acted upon by       the full board of directors.  Applying the NYSE director independence standards without any additional categorical standards, our board of directors has determined that Keith R. Coogan, John E. Harper, Meredith W. Mendes, Cecil H. Moore, Jr., Thomas       P. Stafford and R. Gerald Turner are independent and have no material relationship with us other than serving as our directors.  While the members of our management development and compensation committee currently satisfy the independence       requirements of the NYSE, we have chosen not to satisfy all of the NYSE corporate governance standards for a compensation committee, including not having a charter for our management development and compensation committee.
2018 Meetings and Standing Committees of the Board of Directors.  The board of directors held five meetings in 2018.  Each of our directors then in office attended at least 75% of such meetings and the 2018 meetings of the       committees on which he or she served at the time.  It is expected that each director nominee will attend our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, which is held immediately before the annual meeting of the board of directors.  All of our directors who       were elected at our 2018 annual stockholder meeting attended such meeting.
The board of directors has established and delegated authority to two standing committees, which are       described below.  The board of directors is expected to elect the members of the standing committees at the board of directors annual meeting immediately following the annual stockholder meeting.  The board of directors from time to time may       establish other committees to assist it in the discharge of its responsibilities.
Audit Committee.  Our audit committee assists with the board of directors' oversight responsibilities relating to our financial accounting and reporting processes and auditing processes.  The purpose, authority, resources and       responsibilities of our audit committee are more specifically set forth in its charter.  Applying the requirements of the NYSE corporate governance standards (without additional categorical standards) and SEC regulations, as applicable, the board of       directors has determined that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· each member of our audit committee is independent, financially literate and has no material relationship with us                  other than serving as our director; and  
· Cecil H. Moore, Jr., Meredith W. Mendes and John E. Harper are each an "audit committee financial expert."  
[END TABLE]
No member of our audit committee serves on more than three public company audit committees.  For further       information on the role of our audit committee, see the Audit Committee Report in this proxy statement.  The current members of our audit committee are Cecil H. Moore, Jr. (chairman), Keith R. Coogan (who is not standing for reelection as a       director), John E. Harper, Meredith W. Mendes, Thomas P. Stafford and R. Gerald Turner.  Our audit committee held seven meetings in 2018.
- 13 -
Management Development and Compensation Committee.  The principal responsibilities of our management development and compensation committee are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to recommend to the board of directors whether or not to approve any proposed charge to us or any of our privately                  held subsidiaries pursuant to our ISA with Contran;  
· to review certain matters regarding our employee benefit plans or programs, including discretionary incentive                  bonuses and salaries we pay;  
· to review, approve, administer and grant awards under our equity compensation plan; and  
· to review and administer such other compensation matters as the board of directors may direct from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
As discussed above, the board of directors has determined that each member of our management development       and compensation committee is independent by applying the NYSE director independence standards (without additional categorical standards).  The management development and compensation committee may delegate to its members or our officers any or all       of its authority as it may choose subject to certain limitations of Delaware law on what duties directors may delegate.  The committee has not exercised this right of delegation. With respect to the role of our executive officers in determining or       recommending the amount or form of executive compensation, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.  With respect to director cash compensation, our executive officers make recommendations on such compensation       directly to our board of directors for its consideration without involving the management development and compensation committee.  The current members of our management development and compensation committee are R. Gerald Turner (chairman), Keith R.       Coogan (who is not standing for reelection as a director) and Thomas P. Stafford.  Our management development and compensation committee held two meetings in 2018.
Risk Oversight.  Our board of directors oversees the actions we take in managing our material risks.  Our management is responsible for our day-to-day management of risk.  The board's oversight of our material risks is undertaken       through, among other things, various reports and assessments that management presents to the board and the related board discussions.  The board has delegated some of its primary risk oversight to our audit committee and management development and       compensation committee.  Our audit committee annually receives management's reports and assessments on, among other things, the risk of fraud, certain material business risks and a ranking of such material business risks and our insurance program.        The audit committee also receives reports from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding, among other things, financial risks and the risk of fraud.  Our management development and compensation committee receives management's       assessments on the likelihood that our compensation policies and practices could have a material adverse effect on us, as more fully described in the Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management section of this proxy       statement.  The audit committee and management development and compensation committee report to the board of directors about their meetings. We believe the leadership structure of the board of directors is appropriate for our risk oversight.
Identifying and Evaluating Director Nominees.  Historically, our management has recommended director nominees to the board of directors.  As stated in our corporate governance guidelines:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our board of directors has no                  specific minimum qualifications for director nominees;  
· each nominee should possess the necessary business background, skills and expertise at the policy-making level and                  a willingness to devote the required time to the duties and responsibilities of membership on the board of directors; and  
· the board of directors believes that experience as our director is a valuable asset and that directors who have                  served on the board for an extended period of time are able to provide important insight into our current and future operations.  
[END TABLE]
- 14 -
In identifying, evaluating and determining our director nominees, the board of directors follows such corporate governance       guidelines.  The board also considers the nominee's ability to satisfy the need, if any, for required expertise on the board of directors or one of its committees.  While we do not have any policy regarding the diversity of our nominees, the board       does consider diversity in the background, skills and expertise at the policy making level of our director nominees, and as a result our board believes our director nominees possess a diverse range of senior management experience that aids the board       in fulfilling its responsibilities.  The board of directors believes its procedures for identifying and evaluating director nominees are appropriate for a controlled company under the NYSE corporate governance standards.
Leadership               Structure of the Board of Directors and Independent Director Meetings.  Loretta J. Feehan serves as our chair of the board (non-executive), and Robert D. Graham         serves as our vice chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.  The board of directors believes our current leadership structure is appropriate for a controlled company under the NYSE corporate governance guidelines.        While there is no single organizational structure that is ideal in all circumstances, the board of directors believes that having different individuals serve as our chair of the board (non-executive) and as our chief executive officer reflects the       established working relationship for these positions regarding our business and provides an appropriate breadth of experience and perspective that effectively facilitates the formulation of our long-term strategic direction and business plans.  In       addition, the board of directors believes that since Ms. Feehan is a representative of Contran, her service as our chair of the board (non-executive) is beneficial in providing strategic leadership for us since there is a commonality of interest that       is closely aligned in building long-term stockholder value for all of our stockholders.  We have in the past, and may in the future, have a leadership structure in which the same individual serves as our chairman of the board and as our chief       executive officer. In those instances, the individual has been, or would be expected to be, an employee or representative of Contran.
Pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines, our independent directors are entitled to meet on a       regular basis throughout the year, and will meet at least once annually, without the participation of our other directors who are not independent.  We are not required to have a lead independent director under the NYSE corporate governance       standards.  While we do not have a lead independent director, the chairman of our audit committee presides at all of the meetings of our independent directors.   In 2018, we complied with the NYSE requirements for meetings of our independent       directors.
Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  Stockholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for stockholder action at our annual stockholder meetings, consistent with rules       adopted by the SEC.  We must receive such proposals not later than November 27, 2019 to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy card relating to our annual meeting of stockholders in 2020.  Our bylaws require that the       proposal must set forth a brief description of the proposal, the name and address of the proposing stockholder as they appear in our records, the number of shares of our common stock the stockholder holds and any material interest the stockholder has       in the proposal.
The board of directors will consider the director nominee recommendations of our stockholders in       accordance with the process discussed above.  Our bylaws require that a nomination set forth the name and address of the nominating stockholder, a representation that the stockholder will be a stockholder of record entitled to vote at the annual       stockholder meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the nominee, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and the nominee (or other persons pursuant to which the nomination is       to be made), such other information regarding the nominee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC and the consent of the nominee to serve as a director if elected.
For proposals or director nominations to be brought at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders but not       included in the proxy statement for such meeting, our bylaws require that the proposal or nomination must be delivered or mailed to our principal executive offices in most cases no later than February 16, 2020.  Proposals and nominations should be       addressed to our corporate secretary at Kronos Worldwide, Inc., Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas 75240‑2697.

Communications with Directors.  Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the board of directors or its independent directors may do so through the following procedures.  Such communications not       involving complaints or concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters related to us may be sent to the attention of our corporate         secretary at Kronos Worldwide, Inc., Three Lincoln Centre, 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1700, Dallas, Texas  75240-2697.  Provided that any such communication relates to our business or affairs and is within the function of our board of       directors or its committees, and does not relate to insignificant or inappropriate matters, such communication, or a summary of such communication, will be forwarded to the chairman of our audit committee, who also serves as the presiding director of       our independent director meetings.
Complaints or concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters, which may       be made anonymously, should be sent to the attention of our general counsel with a copy to our chief financial officer at the same address as our corporate secretary.  These complaints or concerns will be forwarded to the chairman of our audit       committee.  We will investigate and keep these complaints or concerns confidential and anonymous, to the extent feasible, subject to applicable law.  Information contained in such a complaint or concern may be summarized, abstracted and aggregated       for purposes of analysis and investigation.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation.  As discussed above, for 2018 the management development and compensation committee       was composed of R. Gerald Turner, Keith R. Coogan (who is not standing for reelection as a director) and Thomas P. Stafford.  No member of the committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· was an officer or employee of ours during 2018 or any prior year;  
· had any related party relationships with us that requires disclosure under applicable SEC rules; or  
· had any interlock relationships under applicable SEC rules.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, no executive officer of ours had any interlock relationships within the scope of the intent of applicable SEC       rules.  However, during 2018 Robert D. Graham was an executive officer of ours and on the board of directors of Contran when concurrently also serving as one of our directors.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics.  The code applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer,       principal accounting officer and controller.  Only the board of directors may amend the code.  Only our audit committee or other committee of the board of directors with specifically delegated authority may grant a waiver of this code.  We will       disclose amendments to or waivers of the code as required by law and the applicable rules of the NYSE.
Corporate Governance Guidelines.  We have adopted corporate governance guidelines to assist the board of directors in exercising its responsibilities.  Among other things, the corporate governance guidelines provide for director       qualifications, for independence standards and responsibilities, for approval procedures for ISAs and that our audit committee chairman preside at all meetings of the independent directors.
Availability               of Corporate Governance Documents.  A copy of each of our audit committee charter, code of business conduct and ethics and corporate governance guidelines is available on our website at www.kronostio2.com under the corporate governance section of the investor relations page.

COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS       AND DIRECTORSAND OTHER INFORMATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis.  This compensation discussion and analysis describes the key principles and factors underlying our executive compensation policies for our named executive officers.  In each of the last three       years, all of our named executive officers were employed by Contran and provided their services to us pursuant to our ISA with Contran.
As defined in the Glossary of Terms at the beginning of this proxy statement, the phrase "named executive       officers" refers to the five persons whose compensation is summarized in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.  Such phrase is not intended to refer, and does not refer, to all of our executive officers.
Nonbinding               Advisory Stockholder Vote on Executive Officer Compensation.  For the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we submitted a nonbinding advisory proposal recommending         the stockholders adopt a resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the 2018 proxy statement.  At the annual meeting, the resolution received the affirmative vote of 87.1% of the shares of our common stock eligible to vote at the annual meeting.  We considered the favorable result         and determined not to make any material changes to our compensation practices.
Intercorporate Services Agreement with Contran.  We pay Contran a fee for services provided by Contran to us pursuant to our ISA with Contran, which fee was approved by our independent directors after receiving the recommendation of       our management development and compensation committee and the concurrence of our chief financial officer.  Such services provided under this ISA included the services of our named executive officers, and as a result a portion of the aggregate ISA fee       we pay to Contran is paid with respect to the services provided to us by such named executive officers. The nature of the duties of each of our executive officers who are employees of Contran is consistent with the duties normally associated with the       officer titles and positions such officer holds with us.
The charge under this ISA reimburses Contran for its cost of employing the personnel who       provide the services by allocating such cost to us based on the estimated percentage of time such personnel were expected to devote to us over the year.  The amount of the fee we paid for each year under this ISA for a person who provided services to       us represents, in management's view, the reasonable equivalent of "compensation" for such services.  See the Intercorporate Services Agreements part of the Certain Relationships and Transactions section of this proxy statement for the aggregate       amount we paid to Contran in 2018 under this ISA.  Under the various ISAs among Contran and its subsidiaries and affiliates, we share the cost of the employment of our named executive officers with Contran and certain of its publicly and privately       held subsidiaries.  For our named executive officers, the portion of the annual charge we paid for each of the last three years to Contran under this ISA attributable to each of their services is set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in       this proxy statement.  As discussed further below, the amounts charged under the ISA are dependent upon Contran's cost of employing or engaging the personnel who provide the services to us (including the services of our named executive officers) by       allocating such cost to us based on the estimated percentage of time such personnel were expected to devote to us over the year.  The amount charged under the ISA is not dependent upon our financial performance.
We believe the cost of the services received under our ISA with Contran, after considering the quality of       the services received, is fair to us and is no less favorable to us than we could otherwise obtain from an unrelated third party for comparable services, based solely on our collective business judgment and experience without performing any       independent market research.
In the early part of each year, Contran's management, including certain of our named executive officers,       estimates the percentage of time that each Contran employee, including our named executive officers, is expected to devote in the upcoming year to Contran and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us.  Contran's management then allocates       Contran's cost of employing each of its employees among Contran and its various subsidiaries and affiliates based on such estimated percentages.  Contran's aggregate cost of employing each of its employees comprises:
- 17 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the annualized base salary of such employee at the beginning of the year;  
· an estimate of the bonus Contran will pay or accrue for such employee (other than bonuses, if any, for specific                  matters) for the year, using as a reasonable approximation for such bonus the actual bonus that Contran paid or accrued for such employee in the prior year; and  
· Contran's portion of the social security and medicare taxes on such base salary and an estimated overhead factor                  (25% for 2018 and 2017, and 23% for 2016) applied to the base salary for the cost of medical and life insurance benefits, unemployment taxes, disability insurance, defined benefit and defined contribution plan benefits, professional                  education and licensing and costs of providing an office, equipment and supplies related to providing such services.  
[END TABLE]
Contran's senior management subsequently made such adjustments to the details of the proposed ISA charge as they deemed       necessary for accuracy, overall reasonableness and fairness to us.
In the first quarter of each year, the proposed charge for that year under our ISA with Contran was       presented to our management development and compensation committee, and the committee considered whether to recommend that our board of directors approve the ISA charge.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the quality of the services Contran provides to us, including the quality of the services our executive officers                  provide to us;  
· the comparison of the ISA charge and number of full-time equivalent employees reflected in the charge by department                  for the prior year and proposed for the current year;  
· the comparison of the prior year and proposed current year charges by department and in total and such amounts as a                  percentage of Contran's similarly calculated costs for its departments and in total for those years;  
· the comparison of the prior year and proposed current year average hourly rate; and  
· the concurrence of our chief financial officer as to the reasonableness of the proposed charge.  
[END TABLE]
In determining whether to recommend that the board of directors approve the proposed ISA fee to be charged       to us, the management development and compensation committee considers the three elements of Contran's cost of employing the personnel who provide services to us, including the cost of employing our named executive officers, in the aggregate and not       individually.  After considering the information contained in such presentations, and following further discussion and review, our management development and compensation committee recommended that our board of directors approve the proposed ISA fee       after concluding that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the cost to employ the personnel necessary to provide the quality of the services provided by Contran would exceed                  the proposed aggregate fee to be charged by Contran to us under our ISA with Contran; and  
· the cost for such services would be no less favorable than could otherwise be obtained from an unrelated third                  party for comparable services in the committee's collective business judgment and experience, without performing any independent market research.  
[END TABLE]
- 18 -
In reaching its recommendation, our management development and compensation committee did not review:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any ISA charge from Contran to any other publicly held parent or sister company, although such charge was                  separately reviewed by the management development and compensation committee of the applicable company; and  
· the compensation policies of Contran or the amount of time our named executive officers are expected to devote to                  us because:  
 o   each of our named executive officers provides services to many companies related to Contran, including Contran                  itself;  
 o   the fee we pay to Contran under our ISA with Contran each year does not represent all of Contran's cost of                  employing each of such named executive officers;  
 o   Contran and these other companies related to Contran absorb the remaining amount of Contran's cost of employing                  each of such named executive officers; and o   the members of our management development and compensation committee consider the other factors discussed above in                  determining whether to recommend that the proposed ISA fee for each year be approved by the full board of directors.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the recommendation of our management development and compensation committee, as well as the       concurrence of our chief financial officer, our independent directors approved the proposed annual ISA charge effective January 1, 2018, with our other directors abstaining.
For financial reporting and income tax purposes, the ISA fee is expensed as incurred on a quarterly       basis.  Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows an income tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation over $1.0 million paid to the company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and three other most highly       compensated executive officers (during 2016 and 2017, the Code contained an exception to such limitation for performance-based compensation).  To the extent any individual's charge to a publicly held company under the ISA was in excess of $1.0       million, the deductibility by the company of the charge for income tax purposes would be limited under Section 162(m), if such section were to be deemed applicable as it relates to the ISA.  In 2016, the Contran ISA did not include charges in excess       of $1.0 million for any individual.  In 2017 and 2018 the ISA did include, and in 2019 the ISA will include, charges in excess of $1.0 million for certain individuals.  However, Contran has agreed to absorb the impact of any such income tax deduction       disallowance resulting from such charges in excess of $1.0 million.
Director         Fees, including Equity-Based Compensation.  Prior to July 2017, we paid director fees in the form of cash and stock compensation to Mr. Graham, who provided services to us pursuant to our ISA with Contran and who also served on our board of       directors.  Other than these director fees, we did not pay any compensation directly to Mr. Graham.  Effective July 2017, our executive officers, including our named executive officers, are no longer eligible to receive cash compensation for their       service on our board of directors.  Beginning in 2018, our executive officers, including our named executive officers, are no longer eligible to receive equity-based compensation for their service on our board of directors.
The 2018 Summary Compensation Table sets forth the cash fees that we paid to Mr. Graham for his director       services prior to July 2017.  The director fees paid to him were quarterly director retainer fees and fees for attending board meetings.  The cash director fees paid were not dependent upon our financial performance.
The 2018 Summary Compensation Table sets forth the director stock grants we paid to Mr. Graham for his       director services prior to July 2017.  See footnote 4 to the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for a discussion of the formula by which these stock awards were determined.  The stock grants Mr. Graham received prior to July 2017 were pursuant to the       same formula used for all directors at the time.  The dollar amount of the stock award appearing in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table represents the value recognized for financial statement reporting purposes of shares of common stock we granted to       Mr. Graham for his director services.
Prior to 2016, we decided to forgo the grant of any equity compensation other than annual awards of stock       to our directors, as discussed above.  We also do not have any security ownership requirements or guidelines for our management or directors.  We do not currently anticipate any equity-based compensation will be granted in 2019, other than the annual       grants of stock to our directors who are not employees of Contran or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates.

  (1)   Certain non-applicable columns have been omitted from this table.  
 (2)   Mr. Graham, who has served as our chief executive officer since January 20, 2017, is one of our named executive                  officers only for 2017 and 2018.  
 (3)   The amounts shown in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table as salary for each of these named executive officers                  include the portion of the fees we paid pursuant to our ISA with Contran with respect to the services such officer rendered to us and our subsidiaries.  The ISA charges disclosed for Contran employees who perform executive officer services                  for us and our subsidiaries are based on various factors described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.  Our management development and compensation committee considers the factors described in the                  Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement in determining whether to recommend that our board of directors approve the aggregate proposed ISA fee with Contran.  As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and                  Analysis section of this proxy statement, our management development and compensation committee does not consider any ISA charge from Contran to any other publicly held parent or sister company of ours, although such charge is separately                  reviewed by the management development and compensation committee of the applicable company.  The amounts shown in the table for salary for Mr. Graham also includes director cash compensation paid to him by us for his services as a                  director.  The components of salary shown in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for Mr. Graham are as follows.

 (a)   Effective July 2017, Mr. Graham, as an employee of Contran, was no longer eligible to receive cash                  compensation for his service on our board of directors and accordingly, his director compensation reflects that he did not receive director compensation after such date.  
 (4)   Stock awards to Mr. Graham in 2017 consisted of shares of our common stock we granted to him in 2017 for his                  director services.  We valued these stock awards at the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic                  718.  Beginning in 2018, Mr. Graham, as an employee of Contran, was no longer eligible for equity-based compensation as a director of us.  As preapproved by our management development and compensation committee, on the day of the 2017                  annual stockholder meeting, each director elected on that day received a grant of fully-vested shares of our common stock under our 2012 Director Stock Plan as determined by a formula based on the closing price of a share of our common                  stock on the date of such meeting, as follows:

No Grants of Plan-Based Awards.  During 2018, no named executive officer received any plan-based awards from us or our subsidiaries.
No Outstanding Equity Awards at December 31, 2018.  We have never granted any stock options to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of our common stock that were subject to vesting restrictions.  At December 31, 2018, none       of our named executive officers held any stock options exercisable for shares of common stock of our parent or subsidiary corporations or held any equity incentive awards for such shares.
No Option Exercises or Stock Vested.  None of our named executive officers held shares of our stock or of our parent or subsidiary corporations that were subject to vesting restrictions in 2018.  During 2018, no       named executive officer exercised any stock options issued by us.
Pension Benefits.  We do not have any defined benefit pension plans in which our named executive officers participate.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.  We do not owe any nonqualified deferred compensation to our named executive officers.

Pay Ratio Disclosure  In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted a rule         requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of a registrant's median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of its chief executive officer.  For 2018, the total annual compensation (as disclosed in the 2018 Summary         Compensation Table) of Robert D. Graham, our chief executive officer, is $2,631,000; the reasonable estimate of the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees except our chief executive officer, calculated in a manner         consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, is $92,020, and the ratio of such two amounts is 29 to 1.
For purposes of this disclosure, our "median employee" was estimated using a simple random sample       statistical sampling technique, pursuant to which we and each of our consolidated subsidiaries worldwide selected every seventh employee listed on their first payroll register for the month of October 2017.  Based on such random sample of our       employees, and using the 2017 base salary (or equivalent for hourly employees) for each employee in such random sample as reflected in our payroll records, the median employee was estimated by determining the employee in such random sample who had       the median 2017 base salary (or equivalent for hourly employees).  Base salary (or equivalent) amounts were annualized for any employee who had less than a full year of service during 2017.  In determining the median employee, we used the applicable       average exchange rates for the month of October 2017.   There has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since that median employee was identified that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio       disclosure.  For providing the median employee's annual total compensation in U.S. dollars, we used the applicable average exchange rate for all of 2018.  For this pay ratio disclosure we have used Mr. Graham's total annual compensation for 2018 as       disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.
Director         Compensation.  Our directors who are not employees of Contran or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates are eligible for cash compensation for service as one of our directors.  The table below reflects the annual rates of their retainers for       2018.
2018 Director Retainers
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Each director      $   25,000    
 Chair of our board      $   50,000    
 Chairman of our audit committee and any member of our audit committee whom the board identified as an "audit committee financial expert"                (provided that if one person served in both capacities only one such retainer was paid)     $   45,000    
 Other members of our audit committee      $   25,000    
 Members of our other committees      $   5,000    
[END TABLE]
Additionally, our eligible directors receive a fee of $1,000 per day for attendance at meetings of the board of directors or       its committees and an hourly rate (not to exceed $1,000 per day) for other services rendered on behalf of our board of directors or its committees.  If a director dies while serving on our board of directors, his or her designated beneficiary or       estate will be entitled to receive a death benefit equal to the annual retainer then in effect.  We reimburse our directors for reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings and in the performance of other services rendered on behalf of our       board of directors or its committees.
As preapproved by our management development and compensation committee, on the day of       each of our annual stockholder meetings, each of our eligible directors elected on that day receives a grant of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Director Stock Plan, with the number of shares received by each eligible director  equal in       value to $20,000 (rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares), based on the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, but not more than 10,000 shares.   These shares are fully vested and tradable immediately on their date of       grant, other than restrictions under applicable securities laws.

Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management.  We believe that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are         not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.  In reaching this conclusion, we considered the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· we do not grant equity awards to our employees, officers or other persons who provide services to us under our ISA                  with Contran, which mitigates taking excessive or inappropriate risk for short-term gain that might be rewarded by equity compensation;  
· our executive officers employed by us                    are eligible to receive incentive bonus payments that are determined on a discretionary basis and do not guarantee the employee a particular level of bonus based on the achievement of a specified performance or financial target, which                    also mitigates taking excessive or inappropriate risk for short-term gain;  
· our other key employees are eligible to receive bonuses determined in part on the achievement of specified                  performance or financial targets, but the chance of such employees undertaking actions with excessive or inappropriate risk for short-term gain in order to achieve such bonuses is mitigated because:  
 o   our executive officers employed by us who are responsible for setting the specified performance or financial                  targets are not eligible to receive bonuses based on the achievement of the targets, but instead are only eligible for the discretionary-based bonuses described above; and o   there exist ceilings for our other key                    employee bonuses (which are  not a significant part of their compensation) regardless of the actual level of our financial performance achieved;  
· our officers and other persons who                    provide services to us under our ISA with Contran do not receive compensation from us directly and are employed by Contran, one of our parent corporations, which aligns such officers and persons with the long-term interests of our                    stockholders;  
· since we are a controlled company, as                    previously discussed, management has a strong incentive to understand and perform in the long-term interests of our stockholders; and  
· our experience is that our employees                  are appropriately motivated by our compensation policies and practices to achieve profits and other business objectives in compliance with our oversight of material short and long-term risks.  
[END TABLE]
- 24 -
For a discussion of our compensation policies and practices for our executive officers, please see the Compensation       Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.
Compensation               Consultants.  Neither our board of directors, management development and compensation committee nor management has engaged any compensation consultants.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP       REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who       own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership with the SEC, the NYSE and us.  Based solely on the review of the copies of such forms and representations by certain reporting persons, we believe that for       2018 our executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders complied with all applicable filing requirements under section 16(a).
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS
Related Party Transaction Policy.  From time to time, we engage in transactions with affiliated companies.  Pursuant to our Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions, or RPT Policy, all related party transactions       to which we are or are proposed to be a party are approved or ratified by our audit committee (unless another committee of our board of directors composed solely of independent directors, or all of the independent directors of our board, shall have       approved or ratified the related party transaction).  For certain ongoing related party transactions to which we are a party (referred to as ordinary course of business related party transactions), such approval or ratification shall occur no less       frequently than once a year.  The RPT Policy is available on our website at www.kronostio2.com under the corporate governance section.
During 2018 our audit committee reviewed, adopted and ratified the following ordinary       course of business related party transactions to which we are a party in accordance with the terms of such RPT Policy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Risk Management Program – a program pursuant to which Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities,                  including us, as a group purchase third-party insurance policies and risk management services, with the costs thereof apportioned among the participating companies;  
· Tax Sharing Agreement– the cash payments for income taxes periodically paid by us to Valhi or received by us from                  Valhi, as applicable, and related items pursuant to the terms of our tax sharing agreement with Valhi (such tax sharing agreement being appropriate, given that we and our qualifying subsidiaries are members of the consolidated U.S. federal                  income tax return, and certain state and local jurisdiction income tax returns, of which Contran is the parent company);  
· Cash Management Loans – our unsecured revolving credit facility with Valhi, which provides for loans by us to Valhi                  of up to $60 million; and  
· Data Recovery Program - a program pursuant to which Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities,                  including us, as a group share third-party information technology data recovery services, with the costs thereof apportioned among the participating companies.  
[END TABLE]
Each of these ordinary course of business related party transactions, and the actions       taken by the audit committee in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities under the RPT Policy, are more fully described below.  Our audit committee was not required to approve and ratify the fee we paid to Contran in 2018 under our intercorporate       services agreement with Contran, because such intercorporate services fee is approved by all of the independent directors of our board, as more fully described below.  During 2018, we were not a party to any other related party transactions (ordinary       course of business related party transactions or otherwise) requiring approval or ratification under the RPT Policy.
- 25 -
Relationships with Related Parties.  As set forth under the Security Ownership section of this proxy statement, Lisa K. Simmons       and Serena Simmons Connelly may be deemed to control us.  We and other entities that may be deemed to be controlled by or related to Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly sometime engage in the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· intercorporate transactions, such as guarantees, management, expense and insurance sharing arrangements, tax                  sharing agreements, joint ventures, partnerships, loans, options, advances of funds on open account and sales, leases and exchanges of assets, including securities issued by both related and unrelated parties; and  
· common investment and acquisition strategies, business combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations, securities                  repurchases and purchases and sales (and other acquisitions and dispositions) of subsidiaries, divisions or other business units, which transactions have involved both related and unrelated parties and have included transactions that                  resulted in the acquisition by one related party of an equity interest in another related party.  
[END TABLE]
We periodically consider, review and evaluate and understand that Contran and related entities       periodically consider, review and evaluate such transactions.  Depending upon the business, tax and other objectives then relevant, and restrictions under indentures and other agreements, it is possible that we might be a party to one or more of such       transactions in the future.  In connection with these activities, we may consider issuing additional equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness.  Our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future include participation in       acquisition or restructuring activities conducted by other companies that may be deemed to be related to Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly.
Certain directors or executive officers of CompX, Contran, NL or Valhi also serve as our directors or       executive officers.  Such relationships may lead to possible conflicts of interest.  These possible conflicts of interest may arise under circumstances in which such companies may have adverse interests.  In such an event, we implement such       procedures as are appropriate for the particular transaction, and consistent with the provisions of the RPT Policy.
Intercorporate Services Agreements.  As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, we and certain related       companies have entered into ISAs.  Under the ISAs, employees of one company provide certain services, including executive officer services, to the other company on an annual fixed fee basis.  The services rendered under the ISAs may include       executive, management, financial, internal audit, accounting, tax, legal, insurance, real estate management, environmental management, risk management, treasury, human resources, technical, consulting, administrative, office, occupancy and other       services as required from time to time in the ordinary course of the recipient's business.  The fees paid pursuant to the ISAs are generally based upon an estimated percentage of the time devoted by employees of the provider of the services to the       business of the recipient and the employer's cost related to such employees, which includes the expense for the employees' compensation and an overhead component that takes into account other employment related costs.  Generally, each of the ISAs       renews on a quarterly basis subject to termination by either party pursuant to a written notice delivered 30 days prior to the start of the next quarter.  Because of the number of companies related to Contran and us, we believe we benefit from cost       savings and economies of scale gained by not having certain management, financial, legal, tax, real estate and administrative staffs duplicated at each company, thus allowing certain individuals to provide services to multiple companies.  With       respect to a publicly held company that is a party to an ISA, the ISA and the related aggregate annual charge are approved by the independent directors of the company after receiving the recommendation from the company's management development and       compensation committee as well as the concurrence of the chief financial officer.  See the Intercorporate Services Agreements part of the       Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion on the procedures and considerations taken by our independent directors in approving the aggregate 2018 fee charged to us under our ISA with Contran.
In 2018, we paid Contran fees of approximately $21.1 million for its services under our ISA with Contran,       including amounts for the services of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.  In 2019, we expect to pay Contran fees of approximately $22.8 million for its services under this ISA,       including the services of certain of our named executive officers that are employees of Contran.
- 26 -
Risk Management Program.  We and Contran participate in a combined risk management program.  Pursuant to the program, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities, including us and certain of our subsidiaries and       related entities, as a group, purchase insurance policies and risk management services.  The program apportions its costs among the participating companies.  Tall Pines and EWI provide for or broker the insurance policies.  Tall Pines purchases       reinsurance for substantially all of the risks it underwrites.  EWI also provides claims and risk management services and, where appropriate, engages certain third-party risk management consultants.  Tall Pines is a captive insurance company wholly       owned by Valhi.  EWI is a reinsurance brokerage and risk management company wholly owned by NL.  Tall Pines purchases reinsurance from third-party insurance carriers with an A.M. Best Company rating of generally at least an "A-" (excellent) for       substantially all of the risks it underwrites.  Consistent with insurance industry practices, Tall Pines and EWI receive commissions from insurance and reinsurance underwriters and/or assess fees for the policies that they provide or broker.
With respect to certain of such jointly owned insurance policies, it is possible that unusually large       losses incurred by one or more insureds during a given policy period could leave the other participating companies without adequate coverage under that policy for the balance of the policy period.  As a result, and in the event that the available       coverage under a particular policy would become exhausted by one or more claims, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us, have entered into a loss sharing agreement under which any uninsured loss arising because the       available coverage had been exhausted by one or more claims will be shared ratably amongst those entities that had submitted claims under the relevant policy.  We believe the benefits in the form of reduced premiums and broader coverage associated       with the group coverage for such policies justify the risk associated with the potential for any uninsured loss.
During 2018, we paid Tall Pines and EWI in the aggregate approximately $10.4 million, including       approximately $2.3 million paid by Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., a partnership of which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and a subsidiary of Venator Materials PLC each owns 50%.  These amounts principally represent payments for insurance       premiums, including premiums or fees paid to Tall Pines and commissions or fees paid to EWI.  These amounts also include payments to insurers or reinsurers through EWI for the reimbursement of claims within our applicable deductible or retention       ranges that such insurers and reinsurers paid to third parties on our behalf, as well as amounts for claims and risk management services and various other third-party fees and expenses incurred by the program.  We expect these relationships with Tall       Pines and EWI will continue in 2019.
In October 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our participation in the combined     risk management program.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the premiums for all of the insurance and reinsurance policies are set by third parties (the underwriters for the                  insurance or reinsurance carriers bearing the risk), without any markup by Tall Pines or EWI;  
· the method by which the insurance premiums are allocated among the companies participating in the risk management                  program is generally the same as the basis used by the insurance or reinsurance carriers to establish the premiums for such insurance/reinsurance (i.e. the dominant premium factor, which is the factor that has the greatest impact on the premium, such as revenues, payroll or employee headcount);  
· EWI provides claims and risk management services to each of the companies participating in the risk management                  program, including us, and where appropriate EWI engages third-party risk management consultants;  
· the commissions received by Tall Pines and EWI from the insurance or reinsurance underwriters, and the fees                  assessed for the policies they so provide or broker, are in amounts equal to the commissions or fees which would be received by third-party brokers or underwriters;  
· the insurance coverages provided to us by the risk management program are sufficient and adequate for our purposes;  
[END TABLE]
- 27 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the benefits to our participating in the risk management program include, among others, (a) the ability to obtain                  broader coverage, with strong/solvent underwriters, at a reduced cost as compared to the coverage and cost that would be available if we were to purchase insurance by itself, (b) the greater spread of risk among the companies participating                  in the risk management program, (c) the ability to obtain centralized premium and claim reporting, and (d) the ability to have access to the experienced risk management personnel of EWI, including in the areas of loss controls and claims                  processing; and  
· the "cost of risk" metric, as defined by the Risk and Insurance Management Society, or RIMS, for the Contran group                  is lower as compared to the cost of risk as reflected in a recent RIMS benchmark survey for certain groups of companies comparable to the Contran group.  
[END TABLE]
After considering the information contained in the presentations, including the recommendation of our       chief financial officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that our participation in the risk management program is fair and reasonable to us, and is on terms no less favorable than we       could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified our participation in the risk management program in all       respects.
Tax Matters.  We and our qualifying subsidiaries are members of the consolidated U.S. federal tax return of which Contran is the parent company, which we refer to as the "Contran Tax Group."  We are also a party to a tax sharing       agreement with Contran and Valhi.  As a member of the Contran Tax Group and pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, we and our qualifying subsidiaries compute our provision for U.S. income taxes on a separate company basis using tax elections made by       Contran.  Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and using tax elections made by Contran, we make payments to or receive payments from Valhi in amounts we would have paid to or received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service had we not been a member       of the Contran Tax Group but instead had been a separate taxpayer.  Refunds are limited to amounts previously paid under the tax sharing agreement.  We and our qualifying subsidiaries are also a part of consolidated tax returns filed by Contran in       certain U.S. state jurisdictions, and the terms of the tax sharing agreement also apply to state payments to these jurisdictions.
Under applicable law, we, as well as every other member of the Contran Tax Group, are each jointly and       severally liable for the aggregate federal income tax liability of Contran and the other companies included in the group for all periods in which we are included in the group.  Under our tax sharing agreement, Valhi has agreed to indemnify us for any       liability for income taxes of the Contran Tax Group in excess of our tax liability previously computed and paid by us in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.
Under certain circumstances, tax regulations could require Contran to treat items differently than we       would have treated them on a stand-alone basis.  In such instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to conform to Contran's tax elections.  For 2018, and pursuant to our tax sharing agreement, we       received net cash payments for income taxes from Valhi of approximately $1.9 million.
In February 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our tax sharing       agreement with Contran and Valhi.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
- 28 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the tax sharing agreement is consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of                  America, and consistent with applicable law and regulations; and  
· our income tax accounts are included in the scope of the annual audit of our consolidated financial statements                  performed by PwC, and PwC makes periodic reports to the committee regarding income tax matters related to us.  
[END TABLE]
As part of such presentation, our chief financial officer and our chief tax officer advised the committee       of their belief that the terms of the tax sharing agreement are consistent with the terms of applicable law and regulations, and are fair and reasonable to us, and are on terms no less favorable than would be present if we were not a party to the tax       sharing agreement, and provided the committee with their recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify the tax sharing agreement in all respects.
After considering the information contained in the presentation, including the recommendation of our chief       financial officer and our chief tax officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that the terms of the tax sharing agreement are fair and reasonable to us and on terms no less favorable       than would be present if we were not a party to the tax sharing agreement, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified the tax sharing agreement       in all respects.
Related         Party Loans for Cash Management Purposes.  From time to time, loans and advances are made between us and various related parties pursuant to term and demand notes.  These loans and advances are entered into principally for cash management       purposes pursuant to our cash management program.  When we loan funds to related parties, we are generally able to earn a higher rate of return on the loan than we would earn if the funds were invested in other instruments.  While certain of such       loans may be of a lesser credit quality than cash equivalent instruments otherwise available to us, we believe that we have evaluated the credit risks involved, and that those risks are reasonable and reflected in the terms of the applicable loans.        When we have outstanding indebtedness, we may still decide to enter into a loan to a related party either because the interest rate on the loan to the related party is at a higher rate of return as compared to the interest rate we are paying on our       outstanding indebtedness, or the funds we would be loaning to the related party would not otherwise be used to paydown the outstanding indebtedness (such as, for example, in the case when the outstanding indebtedness has a maturity longer than the       maturity of the loan to the related party).  When we borrow from related parties, we are generally able to pay a lower rate of interest than we would pay if we borrowed from unrelated parties.
During 2018, we had an unsecured revolving promissory note with Valhi whereby we agreed to loan Valhi up       to $60 million.  Our loan to Valhi, as amended, bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.00%, payable quarterly and all principal and unpaid interest due on demand, but in any event no earlier than December 31, 2020. The agreement contains no       financial covenants or other financial restrictions.  Loans made to Valhi at any time under the agreement are at our discretion.  During 2018, we made aggregate loans to Valhi of $2.6 million, Valhi repaid an aggregate of $16.2 million, and the       largest amount of principal outstanding under the loan was $14.4 million. At December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance of such loan to Valhi.  During 2018, we received aggregate interest under this note (including unused commitment fees) of       approximately $0.3 million.
In February 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our loan to Valhi.        Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· While Valhi has not borrowed any amounts in the last two years, we receive an unused commitment fee of 50 basis                  points per annum, payable quarterly;  
· The interest rate we would earn on any outstanding borrowings by Valhi would be higher than the rate of return we                  would earn on any of our funds available for investment;  
· The interest rate we would earn on any outstanding borrowings by Valhi would be an interest rate no less than (and                  generally greater than) the interest rate which a lender would be earning under either our North American revolving bank credit facility or the revolving credit facility of two of our competitors; and  
· Any amounts we might loan to Valhi would not otherwise be used to paydown the outstanding balance of our term loan                  indebtedness, in part since the maturity date of such term loan is over two years in excess of the maturity date of our loan to Valhi.  
[END TABLE]
- 29 -
As part of such presentation, our chief financial officer, after consultation with our treasurer and other       members of our management, advised the committee of his belief that the terms of our loan to Valhi are fair and reasonable to us, and are on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, and provided the committee       with his recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify our loan to Valhi in all respects.
After considering the information contained in the presentation, including the recommendation of our chief       financial officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that the terms of our loan to Valhi are fair and reasonable to us, and are on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain       from unrelated parties, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified our loan to Valhi in all respects.
Data Recovery Program.  We and Contran participate in a combined information technology data recovery program that Contran provides from a data recovery center that it established.  Pursuant to the program, Contran and certain of       its subsidiaries and related entities, including us and certain of our subsidiaries and related entities, as a group share information technology data recovery services.  The program apportions its costs among the participating companies.  We paid       Contran $0.3 million for such services in 2018.  We expect that this relationship with Contran will continue in 2019.
In February 2018, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our participation in       the combined data recovery program.  Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The third-party cost of the data recovery program is passed through to the companies participating in the data                  recovery program, including us, without markup;  
· Such third-party cost is allocated to the companies participating in the data recovery program, including us, based                  on the number of information technology data racks used by each of the companies participating in the data recovery program;  
· The back-up site made available to us under the data recovery program is sufficient and adequate for our purposes;                  and  
· The benefits to our participating in the data recovery program include, among others, the ability to share in the                  cost of a third-party, off-site data recovery center at a reduced cost as compared to the cost to be incurred if we were to obtain a third-party, off-site data recovery center by ourselves, as well as the shared administration of the                  third-party, off-site data recovery center as compared to the cost of administering such a site by ourselves.  
[END TABLE]
As part of such presentation, our chief financial officer, after consultation with other members of our       management, advised the committee of his belief that our participation in the data recovery program, including the allocation of its costs among us and the other entities participating in the data recovery program, is fair and reasonable to us, and       is on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, and provided the committee with his recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify our participation in the data recovery program in all respects.
After considering the information contained in the presentation, including the recommendation of our chief financial officer, and following       further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that our participation in the data recovery program is fair and reasonable to us, and is on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated       parties, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified our participation in the data recovery program in all respects.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Our audit committee of the board of directors is composed of six directors and operates under a written       charter adopted by the board of directors.  All members of our audit committee meet the independence standards established by the board of directors and the NYSE and promulgated by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Three members of our       audit committee meet the audit committee financial expert requirements under the applicable SEC rules.  The audit committee charter is available on our website www.kronostio2.com under the corporate governance section, and our audit committee reviews the adequacy of and compliance with       such charter annually.
Our management is responsible for, among other things, preparing our consolidated financial statements in       accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or "GAAP," establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) and evaluating the       effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, and for expressing an       opinion on the conformity of the financial statements with GAAP.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is also responsible for auditing our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with such standards and for expressing an       opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee       management's implementation of our financial reporting process and the audits of our consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation,       retention and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm.  As part of fulfilling this responsibility, our audit committee engages in an annual evaluation of, among other things, the firm's qualifications, competence, integrity,       expertise, performance, independence and communications with the committee (including these factors as they relate specifically to the firm's lead audit engagement partner), and whether the current firm should be retained for the upcoming year's       audit.  Our audit committee discusses with our independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for the audits they will perform, and the committee meets with the firm throughout the year, both with and without management       being present, to monitor the firm's execution of and results obtained from their audits.  Our audit committee performs other activities throughout the year, in accordance with the responsibilities of the audit committee specified in the audit       committee charter, including the approval or ratification of certain related party transactions in accordance with the terms of our RPT Policy, as discussed above in the Certain Relationships and Transactions section in this proxy statement.
In its oversight role, our audit committee reviewed and discussed our audited consolidated financial       statements and our internal control over financial reporting with management and with PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for 2018.  Management and PwC indicated that our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year       ended December 31, 2018 were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP and that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.  Our audit committee discussed with PwC and management the significant accounting       policies used and significant estimates made by management in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements, and the overall quality of management's financial reporting process.  Our audit committee and PwC also discussed any       issues deemed significant by PwC or the committee, including the matters required to be discussed pursuant to the standards of the PCAOB, the rules of the SEC and other         applicable regulations.  PwC has provided to our audit committee written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit       committee concerning independence, and our audit committee discussed with PwC the firm's independence.  Our audit committee also concluded that       PwC's provision of other permitted non-audit services to us and our related entities is compatible with PwC's independence.
Based upon the foregoing considerations, our audit committee recommended to the board of directors that       our audited consolidated financial statements be included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC.
The members of our audit committee submit the foregoing report as of March 11, 2019.

Preapproval Policies and Procedures.  For the purpose of maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, our audit committee has adopted policies and procedures for the preapproval of audit and       other permitted services the firm provides to us or any of our subsidiaries.  We may not engage the firm to render any audit or other permitted service unless the service is approved in advance by our audit committee pursuant to the committee's       preapproval policy.  Pursuant to the policy:
- 32 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the committee must specifically preapprove, among other things, the engagement of our independent registered public                  accounting firm for audits and quarterly reviews of our financial statements, services associated with certain regulatory filings, including the filing of registration statements with the SEC, and services associated with potential business                  acquisitions and dispositions involving us; and  
· for certain categories of other permitted services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm,                  the committee may preapprove limits on the aggregate fees in any calendar year without specific approval of the service.  
[END TABLE]
These other permitted services include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· audit-related services, such as certain consultations regarding accounting treatments or interpretations and                  assistance in responding to certain SEC comment letters;  
· audit-related services, such as certain other consultations regarding accounting treatments or interpretations,                  employee benefit plan audits, due diligence and control reviews;  
· tax services, such as tax compliance and consulting, transfer pricing, customs and duties and expatriate tax                  services; and  
· assistance with corporate governance matters and filing documents in foreign jurisdictions not involving the                  practice of law.  
[END TABLE]
The policy also lists certain services for which the independent auditor is always prohibited from providing us under       applicable requirements of the SEC or the PCAOB.
Pursuant to the policy, our audit committee has delegated preapproval authority to the chairman of the       committee or his designee to approve any fees in excess of the annual preapproved limits for these categories of other permitted services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.  The chairman must report any action taken       pursuant to this delegated authority at the next meeting of the committee.
For 2018, our audit committee preapproved all of PwC's services provided to us or any of our subsidiaries       in compliance with our preapproval policy without the use of the SEC's de minimis exception to such preapproval requirement.

PROPOSAL 2
NONBINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
Background.  Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, a publicly held company is required to       submit to its stockholders a nonbinding advisory vote to approve the compensation of its named executive officers, commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal.  At our 2018 Annual Meeting our stockholders approved, on a nonbinding advisory basis, an       annual Say-on-Pay.  The next nonbinding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of a Say-on-Pay proposal will be at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Say-on-Pay Proposal.  This proposal affords our stockholders the opportunity to submit a nonbinding advisory vote on our named executive officer compensation.  The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the tabular disclosure       regarding our named executive officer compensation and the related disclosure in this proxy statement describe our named executive officer compensation and the compensation decisions made by our management and our management development and       compensation committee of the board of directors with respect to our named executive officers.  This proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement, but       the compensation of our named executive officers in general.  Our board of directors requests that each stockholder cast a nonbinding advisory vote to adopt the following         resolution:
RESOLVED, that, by the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or       represented by proxy at the 2019 annual stockholder meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, the stockholders of Kronos Worldwide, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the compensation of its executive officers named in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in the 2019 annual meeting proxy statement of Kronos         Worldwide, Inc. as such compensation is disclosed in the proxy statement pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which disclosure includes the compensation discussion and analysis, the         compensation tables and any related disclosure in the proxy statement.
Effect of the Proposal.  The Say-on-Pay proposal is nonbinding and advisory.  Our stockholders' approval or disapproval of this proposal will not require         our board of directors, its management development and compensation committee or our management to take any action regarding our executive compensation practices.
Vote Required.  Because this proposal is a nonbinding advisory vote, there is no minimum requisite vote to approve the Say-on-Pay proposal.  The proposed resolution provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the 2019 annual stockholder meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the requisite         vote to adopt the resolution and approve the compensation of our named executive officers as such compensation is disclosed in this proxy statement.  Accordingly, abstentions will be counted as represented and entitled to vote and will therefore         have the effect of a negative vote.  Broker/nominee non-votes will not be counted as entitled to vote and will have no effect on this proposal.
Valhi and NLKW have each indicated their intention to have their shares of our common stock represented at       the meeting and to vote such shares FOR the Say-on-Pay proposal and adoption of the resolution that approves the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement.  If Valhi alone attends the meeting in person or by proxy and votes as indicated, the meeting will have a quorum present and the stockholders will adopt the resolution and approve the nonbinding advisory Say-on-Pay       proposal.
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE SAY-ON-PAY PROPOSAL AS SET FORTH IN THE NONBINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION APPROVING OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
OTHER MATTERS
The board of directors knows of no other business that will be presented for consideration at the annual       meeting.  If any other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons designated as agents in the enclosed proxy card will vote on such matters in their discretion.

STOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS
Stockholders who share an address and hold shares through a brokerage firm or other nominee may receive       only one copy of the notice of internet availability of proxy materials.  This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces mailing and printing expenses.  A number of brokerage       firms have instituted householding.  You should notify your brokerage firm or other nominee if:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate notice of internet                  availability of proxy materials; or  
· you receive multiple copies of the notice of internet availability of proxy materials at your address and would                  like to request householding of our communications.
