PROXY STATEMENT AND NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING
TABLE OF CONTENTS
March 22, 2019
Dear fellow shareholders:
We begin 2019 with great excitement after announcing our 2018 results which saw record earnings and our ninth consecutive year of adjusted EPS growth. Our financial results demonstrate the outstanding work of our over 16,000 dedicated employees who are consistently focused on our strategy of product and technology leadership along with operational excellence.
Our marine propulsion and parts and accessories businesses continue to excel, with significant growth in 2018. During the year, Mercury completed the largest ever marine product launch with the introduction of the highly successful 175HP-300HP outboard engine platformâ€”26 new models in total. We also completed the acquisition of Power Products, the largest acquisition in Brunswick's history, further strengthening our leading parts and accessories business. The Boat Segment also had strong sales growth and continued operating margin expansion, with contributions from all brands, while Boston Whaler, Lund, and Sea Ray all remain market leaders in their respective premium categories. All in all, the marine segments delivered 12 percent adjusted top-line growth over 2017.
In 2019, we plan to build on these achievements as we transition to an exclusively marine-focused operating model, further enhancing the value of our marine franchise for shareholders. We will continue to lead with product innovation and engineering bringing to market new products and services to make boating easier and more accessible. We will connect even more closely to consumers with leading marine technology and integrated experiences. Finally, we will grow boating participation, expanding our customer base with unique participation opportunities across the recreational marine spectrum.
At the end of 2018, we saw the retirement of our Chairman and CEO Mark Schwabero. We thank Mark for his years of service to Brunswick and leadership on the many significant initiatives completed last year, including several executive leadership changes and a smooth CEO transition. Finally, our Fitness business remains on track to be separated from the portfolio, with refocused efforts on cost improvement and investment in products and technology. 2019 looks to be a year of growth and exciting changes at Brunswick.
Your Board remains committed to delivering long-term, sustainable shareholder value. As part of that commitment, the Board continually evaluates and strengthens Brunswick's governance practices. In the past three years, we adopted bylaw amendments that include proxy access provisions and proposed a plan (approved by shareholders in 2018) to declassify the Board. Your Board also decided to separate the roles of Board Chairman and CEO. We look forward to working in close collaboration as the year progresses. Your Board of Directors is changing, as two of our long-serving Directors, Nolan Archibald and Ralph Stayer, will be retiring from the Board. We want to thank them for their valuable service to the Company. We have also added two new Directors to the Board in anticipation of these retirements and we look forward to the insights, perspective, and expertise they will bring to Brunswick.
Brunswick will begin mailing a notice to our shareholders on March 22, 2019 containing instructions about online access to our 2019 Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as instructions regarding how to receive paper copies of these documents if you prefer.
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please vote via the Internet, by telephone, or by signing and returning a proxy card.
The Board and management team remain committed to delivering long-term value to our investors. Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,

[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee, that institution will instruct you as to how your shares may be voted by proxy, including whether telephone or Internet voting options are available. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee and would like to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must first obtain a proxy issued in your name from the institution that holds your shares.
If you hold any shares in the Brunswick Retirement Savings Plan or the Brunswick Rewards Plan, you must direct the trustee of these plans how to vote these shares by following the instructions on your Notice for voting by telephone at 1-800-690-6903 or via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, or by signing, dating, and mailing in a proxy card. The deadline for voting shares held in the Brunswick Retirement Savings Plan or the Brunswick Rewards Plan is 5:00 p.m. EDT on May 3, 2019. The trustee will vote these shares as you direct. The trustee will vote allocated shares of Common Stock for which proxies are not received in direct proportion to voting by allocated shares for which proxies are received.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEETING
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting, including voting via the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy that is timely submitted prior to the meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date, or by attending the meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked.
If you sign, date, and return a proxy card and indicate how you would like your shares to be voted, your shares will be voted as you have instructed. If you sign, date, and return a proxy card but do not indicate how you would like your shares to be voted, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations. With respect to any other matter that is properly brought before the meeting, the proxy holders will vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their best judgment.
Election of Directors. Brunswick has adopted a majority voting standard for the uncontested election of Directors and, therefore, the four Director nominees shall be elected to the Board of Directors if they each receive a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. Under Brunswick's majority voting standard for uncontested elections, if the number of votes cast "For" a Director nominee's election does not exceed the number of votes cast "Against" election, then the Director nominee must tender his or her resignation from the Board promptly after certification of the shareholders' vote. The Board will decide within 120 days of that certification, through a process managed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and excluding the Director nominee in question, whether to accept the resignation. Because Brunswick has adopted a majority voting standard for the uncontested election of Directors, abstentions will have no effect on the election of Director nominees. If any one or more of the Director nominees is unable to serve, votes will be cast, pursuant to authority granted by the enclosed proxy, for the alternate individual or individuals the Board designates.
Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares having voting power, represented in person or by proxy, will be required for the approval of the non-binding resolution relating to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (NEOs). Because approval of this resolution requires a majority of the shares having voting power and represented at the Annual Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as votes against approval.
Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares having voting power, represented in person or by proxy, will be required for the ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of Deloitte as Brunswick's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Because the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm requires a majority of the shares having voting power and represented at the Annual Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as votes against ratification.
The Annual Meeting will be held only if a quorum is present. A quorum will be present if a majority of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date are represented, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by properly completed proxy cards or ballots marked "Abstain" or returned without voting instructions are counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
Broker non-votes occur when a broker lacks discretionary authority to vote on a proposal and the beneficial owner has not provided instructions about how to vote. Brunswick will treat broker non-votes as present to determine whether or not there is a quorum at the Annual Meeting, but they will not be treated as having voting power on the proposals, if any, for which the broker indicates it does not have discretionary authority. This means that broker non-votes will not have any effect on whether a proposal passes.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEETING
We expect that brokers will have discretionary authority with respect to the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm but will lack discretionary authority with respect to the election of Directors and the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Accordingly, broker non-votes may occur as to these two proposals.
Yes. As a matter of policy, shareholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify individual shareholders are kept confidential and are available only to our tabulator and inspectors of election, who are obligated to keep your vote confidential.
If any matters other than those referred to in the Notice properly come before the meeting, the individuals named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their best judgment. We are not aware of any business other than the items referred to in the Notice that may be considered at the meeting.
Brunswick pays all of the costs of preparing, mailing, and soliciting proxies. We ask brokers, banks, voting trustees, and other nominees and fiduciaries to forward notices and, when requested, proxy materials to the beneficial owners and to obtain authority to execute proxies. We reimburse the brokers, banks, voting trustees, and other nominees and fiduciaries upon request. In addition to solicitation by mail, telephone, facsimile, Internet, or personal contact by our designated officers and employees (who will not receive additional compensation for their solicitation efforts), we have retained the services of Georgeson Inc. to solicit proxies for a fee of $10,500 plus expenses.
Pursuant to SEC rules, we are providing access to our proxy materials via the Internet and have elected to use the SEC's Notice and Access Rules for soliciting proxies. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice to all of our shareholders as of the Record Date. All shareholders may access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice. You may also request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. You can find instructions regarding how to access our proxy materials via the Internet and how to request a printed copy in the Notice. Additionally, by following the instructions in the Notice, you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our Annual Meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it.
Brunswick is sending only one envelope with multiple Notices to you if you share a single address with another shareholder, unless we have received instructions to the contrary from you. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to eliminate duplicate mailings, conserve natural resources, and reduce our printing and mailing costs. We will promptly deliver a separate Notice to you upon written or verbal request. If you wish to receive separate mailings in the future, you may contact Brunswick Shareholder Services by telephone at 847.735.4294, by mail at 26125 N. Riverwoods Blvd., Ste 500, Mettawa, IL 60045, or by email at services@brunswick.com.
If you currently receive multiple Notices, you can request householding by contacting Shareholder Services as described above. If you own your shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee, you can request householding by contacting the holder of record.
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
What am I voting on? Shareholders are being asked to elect four individuals to serve on the Board of Directors.
Recommendation: Your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of the nominees.
The current Board of Directors has nominated:
for election as Directors. If elected by our shareholders, each nominee will serve for a one-year term expiring at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Each Director will hold office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until the Director's earlier resignation or removal. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee engaged a third-party search firm to assist it in recruiting and assessing potential director candidates. Ms. Flaherty and Mr. McClanathan were recruited by the third-party search firm to be nominated to the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors currently has 12 members divided among three classes. In 2018, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved amendments to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the Board of Directors. Therefore, the Directors whose terms expire in 2019 will, if elected, serve for a one-year term, except for Mr. Archibald, who is retiring at the Annual Meeting. Mses. Cooper and Warner will serve until their terms expire in 2020 and will be elected annually thereafter (Mr. Stayer, whose term would otherwise expire in 2020, will retire at the 2019 Annual meeting as well). Messrs. Fernandez, Foulkes, who was appointed to Mr. Schwabero's term, Singer, and Whisler will serve until their terms expire in 2021 and will be elected annually thereafter. After the May 2019 planned retirements of Messrs. Archibald and Stayer, the Board will return to its previous size of ten Directors.
Biographical information follows for each nominee and each Director whose term of office will continue after the Annual Meeting. Additional information is set forth below regarding the specific experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills of the nominees to the Board of Directors that led the Board to conclude that such individuals should serve on the Board in light of our business and leadership structure.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board of Directors has adopted written Principles and Practices (the Principles) which are available on the Brunswick website, www.brunswick.com/company/governance/principlespractices.php, or in print upon request by any Brunswick shareholder. The Principles set the framework for our governance structure. The Board believes that good corporate governance is a source of competitive advantage for Brunswick. Good governance allows the skills, experience, and judgment of the Board to support our executive management team, enabling management to improve our performance and maximize shareholder value.
As set forth in the Principles, the Board's responsibilities include overseeing and directing management in building long-term value for shareholders. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the senior management team are responsible for managing day-to-day business operations and for presenting regular updates to the Board about our business. The Board offers the CEO and management constructive advice and counsel and may, in its sole discretion and at the Company's expense, obtain advice and counsel from independent legal, financial, accounting, compensation, and other advisors.
The Board of Directors met nine times during 2018. Our Directors collectively attended 93% percent of the 2018 Board and committee meetings. The Principles provide that all members of the Board are requested to attend Brunswick's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All Directors then on the Board attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
The independent Directors regularly meet in executive session without members of management present. The Chairman of the Board, Manuel A. Fernandez, presides and acts as the Board's leader. Additionally, the Chairman serves as a liaison between management and the Board and is responsible for consulting with the CEO regarding Board and committee meeting agendas and Board governance matters.

BOARD QUALIFICATIONS
Among other things, the Board expects each Director to understand our business and the markets in which we operate, monitor economic and business trends, and use his or her perspective, background, experience, and knowledge to provide management with insights and guidance. To that end, the Board is comprised of business savvy Directors with strategic mindsets and meaningful operational skills. The Board continually monitors its members' skills and experience and considers its members' expertise for succession planning and committee assignments.
As part of this evaluation process, the Board and its committees conduct annual self-evaluations and the Chairman of the Board may also engage individual Board members regarding Board or Committee performance. Every three years, the Board engages an independent third party to interview Directors. This third party also provides feedback on Board performance relative to peers.

BOARD SELECTION AND REFRESHMENT
THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE   CANDIDATE SELECTION PROCESS
IDENTIFY SCREEN INTERVIEW RECOMMEND TO BOARD
DIRECTOR CANDIDATE CONSIDERATIONS
The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ("Governance Committee") believe that a diverse Board of Directors is important. Therefore, additional consideration is given to achieving an overall diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences in Board membership. The Governance Committee may retain a third-party search firm to assist it with identifying or recruiting qualified candidates.
The Principles require a non-employee Director to retire from the Board at the first annual meeting of shareholders following his or her 75th birthday, and for an employee Director to resign when he or she ceases employment with Brunswick. In 2019, two of our Directors, Nolan Archibald and Ralph Stayer, will retire at the Annual Meeting (the first annual meeting since their 75th birthdays) and our former Chairman and CEO, Mark Schwabero, retired at the end of 2018. After the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board will revert to ten members, its historical size.
The Governance Committee will consider qualified Director candidates who shareholders suggest by written submissions to:
Brunswick Corporation
26125 N. Riverwoods Blvd., Suite 500   Mettawa, IL 60045
Attention: Corporate Secretary's Office fax: 847.735.4433 or email: corporate.secretary@brunswick.com
Any recommendation a shareholder submits must include the name of the candidate, a description of the candidate's educational and professional background, contact information for the candidate, and a brief explanation of why the shareholder believes the candidate is suitable for election. The Governance Committee will apply the same standards in considering Director candidates recommended by shareholders as it applies to other candidates.
In addition to recommending Director candidates to the Governance Committee, shareholders may also, pursuant to procedures established in our Amended By-Laws, directly nominate one or more Director candidates to stand for election through our advance notice or proxy access procedures. In order for a shareholder nominee to be included in our Proxy Statement for an annual meeting, the nomination notice must be provided between 120 and 150 days before the anniversary date that we first mailed our Proxy Statement for the annual meeting of the previous year, and must comply with all applicable requirements in the Amended By-Laws. To nominate Director candidates to stand for election at an annual meeting of shareholders without including them in our proxy materials, a shareholder must deliver written notice of the nomination to Brunswick's Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. For a special meeting of shareholders, a shareholder wishing to make such a nomination must deliver written notice of the nomination to Brunswick's Secretary no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of the meeting is first given to shareholders. In any case, a notice of nomination submitted by a shareholder must include information concerning the nominating shareholder and the shareholder's nominee(s) as required by our Amended By-Laws.
BOARD LEADERSHIP
The Board remains committed to increasing shareholder value, in part by continually evaluating its own leadership and governance structure. In 2018, the Board prepared for significant executive changes as well as Board refreshment activities, in anticipation of the retirement of two senior Directors and the former CEO. In light of these changes, the Board decided to separate the Chairman and CEO roles, appointing David Foulkes as CEO and Manuel Fernandez, former Lead Independent Director, as non-executive Chairman of the Board, both effective January 2019. The Board believes this structure is optimal at this time, and will leverage both Mr. Fernandez's extensive Board leadership experience in a variety of businesses with strong commercial product offerings and Mr. Foulkes' significant experience with the Company and its operations.
Although the CEO is the Director most familiar with our business, industry, and day-to-day operations, the Chairman of the Board and the independent Directors have invaluable experience and expertise from outside the Company, giving them different perspectives regarding our strategic goals and objectives. As a Director, Mr. Foulkes is well-positioned to bring Company-specific experience to help the Board focus on those issues of greatest importance to the Company and its shareholders.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
As noted in the Principles, the Board believes that independent Directors should constitute a substantial majority of the Board and that no more than two members of management may serve on the Board at the same time. The Principles provide that a Director shall be considered to be independent if he or she satisfies the general Director independence standards established by the NYSE. The NYSE standards provide that a Director will not be independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the Director has no material relationship with Brunswick (either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Brunswick).
Applying the NYSE standards, and considering all relevant facts and circumstances, the Board has made an affirmative determination that none of the non-management Directors has a material relationship with Brunswick and that all non-management Directors, comprised of Mr. Archibald, Ms. Cooper, Mr. Everitt, Mr. Fernandez, Ms. Flaherty, Mr. McClanathan, Mr. Singer, Mr. Stayer, Ms. Warner, Mr. Whisler, and Mr. Wood are independent. Mr. Foulkes is not independent due to his position as CEO of Brunswick. Mr. Schwabero, a former Director and former CEO, was also not independent due to his role with the Company.
RECENT FOCUS AREAS
Our Board is active and engaged, not only providing outstanding oversight and governance, but also refining procedures consistent with current best practices.
TRANSITION TO MARINE OPERATING MODEL WITH FITNESS SEPARATION ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC GROWTH PLANS BOARD LEADERSHIP, REFRESHMENT, AND EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA SECURITY INITIATIVES
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our active investor relations efforts include regular and ongoing engagement with current and potential investors, financial analysts, and the media through conference calls, face-to-face investor meetings, correspondence, conferences, and other events. This ensures that management and the Board understand, consider, and address the issues that matter most to our shareholders. Since 2012, Brunswick has held an Investor Day at least every two years, most recently in February 2019. These Investor Days allow investor access to our top managers to discuss and explain our businesses, update the live and webcast audience on our progress against our current long-term plan, and outline our future plans, strategies, and commitments.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION
The Principles provide that our shareholders or other interested parties may, at any time, communicate in writing with the Board, the Chairman of the Board, or the other Independent Directors as a group, by writing to:
Brunswick Corporation  26125 N. Riverwoods Blvd., Suite 500  Mettawa, IL 60045  Attention: Corporate Secretary's Office fax: 847.735.4433 or email: corporate.secretary@brunswick.com
The General Counsel will review and distribute to the Board, the Chairman of the Board, or the other independent Directors as a group, as appropriate, copies of written communications received by any of these means, depending on the subject matter and facts and circumstances described in the communication. Communications that are not related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board, or are otherwise considered to be improper for submission to the intended recipient(s), will not be forwarded to the Board, the Chairman of the Board, or the non-management Directors.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board of Directors has five committees: Audit, Finance, Human Resources and Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Executive. In addition, two Directors (D. Everitt and D. Singer) are currently serving as Fitness Transaction Leaders, leading the Fitness business separation. Each committee is comprised solely of independent Directors, as that standard is determined by the Principles and the NYSE Listed Company Manual, with the exception of the Executive Committee, of which Mr. Schwabero was a member in 2018 and of which Mr. Foulkes became a member in 2019. Each of the committees may, at its sole discretion and at Brunswick's expense, obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, financial, accounting, or other experts and advisors.
The following table shows the current membership of these committees:
BOARD COMMITTEES
The principal responsibilities of each of these committees are described generally below and in detail in their respective committee charters, which are available at www.brunswick.com/company/governance/committees.html, or in print upon request by any Brunswick shareholder.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing:
The Committee reviews certain regulatory and compliance matters, policies regarding risk assessment and risk management, corporate tax strategy, cybersecurity, and our Information Security programs. The Audit Committee also receives and investigates any reports made to it concerning possible material violations of law or breaches of fiduciary duty by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, or agents. The Audit Committee maintains free and open communication, and meets separately at each regularly scheduled Board meeting with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, its internal auditors, and management.
The Finance Committee assists the Board as follows:
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) assists the Board as follows:
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Compensation Committee continues to engage Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook) to provide advice on various aspects of Brunswick's executive compensation programs. The Committee meets with FW Cook in executive session on a regular basis and FW Cook reports directly to the Committee. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of FW Cook pursuant to applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards and has concluded that FW Cook's work for the Compensation Committee does not raise any conflict of interest.
The Governance Committee assists the Board as follows:
The Governance Committee has responsibility for making recommendations regarding director compensation design to the Board of Directors for review and action. Our Human Resources Department and outside consultants provide the Governance Committee with director compensation data as publicly reported, including data relating to peer group and other similarly-sized companies, as well as data from published surveys.
In addition to its standing committees, the Board of Directors has an Executive Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board, and the Chairs of the Audit, Finance, Compensation, and Governance Committees. The Executive Committee meets from time to time at the request of the Chairman of the Board and, in 2018, the Executive Committee met to consider matters related to the separation of the Fitness business.
GOVERNANCE POLICIES & PRACTICES
BRUNSWICK ETHICS PROGRAM
Brunswick has adopted the Brunswick Code of Conduct (the Code), which applies to all employees, officers, directors, vendors, suppliers, and agents, and includes standards and procedures for reporting and addressing potential conflicts of interest, as well as a general code of conduct that provides guidelines regarding how to conduct business in an ethical manner. The Board has adopted an additional Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Managers (the Financial Officer Code of Ethics). The Financial Officer Code of Ethics applies to Brunswick's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice Presidentâ€”Treasurer, Vice Presidentâ€”Tax, Vice Presidentâ€”Internal Audit, Vice President and Controller, and other designated Brunswick employees, and sets forth standards to which these officers and employees are to adhere in areas such as conflicts of interest, disclosure of information, and compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. The Financial Officer Code of Ethics supplements the Code. The Governance Committee, Audit Committee, and our Ethics Office oversee and administer these policies. The Code and the Financial Officer Code of Ethics are available at www.brunswick.com/company/ethics/codeofethics.php, and any Brunswick shareholder may obtain them in print upon request. If Brunswick grants a waiver of the policies set forth in the Code or the Financial Officer Code of Ethics, or materially amends either, we will, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation, or NYSE listing standard, disclose that waiver or amendment by making an appropriate statement on our website at www.brunswick.com.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
Pursuant to its charter, the Governance Committee is tasked with the recommendation and review of corporate governance principles, policies, and programs designed to ensure our compliance with high ethical standards and with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including those relating to conflicts of interest and other business practices that reflect upon our role as a responsible corporate citizen. The Governance Committee oversees the implementation of the Code, which contains our conflicts of interest policy. The Governance Committee reports on these compliance matters to the Board of Directors, which is ultimately responsible for overseeing the Company's ethical and legal compliance, including transactions with "related persons."
Our policy regarding related person transactions (the Related Person Transactions Policy) defines "related persons" to include all Directors and Executive Officers of the Company, all beneficial owners of more than 5 percent of any class of voting securities of the Company, and the immediate family members of any such persons. On a regular basis, we request Directors and Executive Officers to complete a questionnaire including questions designed to identify related persons and any potential related person transactions. Our General Counsel and Controller, or their delegates, review and update a listing of those individuals identified as related persons and provide a copy of this listing to our external auditors on at least an annual basis and more often as warranted. According to the Related Person Transactions Policy, a related person transaction includes certain transactions in which the Company is a participant and in which a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest, including any financial transaction, arrangement, or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships. Certain transactions are excluded from the Related Person Transactions Policy.
If a related person transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC rules is identified, the Related Person Transactions Policy requires that the General Counsel and Controller review the transaction and advise the Chair of the Governance Committee as well as the Chair of the Audit Committee, if appropriate. The Governance Committee may approve or ratify such transaction or, if it determines that the transaction should be considered by the Board of Directors, submit it for consideration by all disinterested members of the Board (the Reviewing Directors). In determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Governance Committee and/or the Reviewing Directors will consider relevant factors, including:
The Related Person Transactions Policy was formally codified in a written document in July 2010. Since January 1, 2018, no transaction has been identified as a related person transaction and, therefore, no transaction was referred to the Board or any Board committee for review in that time period.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board of Directors has an active role in overseeing effective management of our risks and regularly reviews information regarding our credit, liquidity, cash flow, and business operations, including any associated risks, such as cybersecurity and regulatory risks. The Board conducts an annual, in-depth review of our business, which includes detailed analysis and consideration of strategic, operational, financial, legal, competitive, compliance, and compensation risk areas. Although the Board as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, each Board Committee addresses relevant risk topics as part of its Committee responsibilities. The Committees oversee our risk profile and exposures relating to matters within the scope of their authority and provide periodic reports to the full Board about their deliberations and recommendations. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and overall compensation philosophy.
Historically, in an ongoing effort to manage risk, we have maintained a level of financial prudence associated with our compensation programs which we plan to continue. In assessing whether risks arising from our compensation programs or policies were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, senior management reviewed our compensation programs and practices for all employees, the potential risk exposure presented by those programs and practices, and the factors, tools, and processes that mitigate those risks. As part of its 2018 review, management considered the compensation arrangements currently in place for employees and officers and, following this review, management determined, and the Compensation Committee agreed, that none of our compensation programs or policies creates risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
As part of this process, management presented a summary to the Compensation Committee for discussion. The summary listed each compensation program and policy applicable to the various groups of Brunswick employees and officers, the potential risks presented by that program or policy, and the risk mitigation tools or processes employed by the Company to mitigate the related risks.
The compensation programs and policies covered by the summary included payments in the forms of base salaries, annual incentive compensation, and equity-based awards. The risk mitigation tools covered by the summary included the following: (1) the plans were capped at maximum payout levels that, while creating incentives for superior business performance, were not so great as to entice undue risk-taking; (2) the performance metrics to achieve above-target payouts under the plans were not unduly leveraged (that is, small increments of above-target performance would not result in disproportionate increases in calculated plan bonus amounts); and (3) the annual incentive plans contain negative discretion provisions that can be (and have been) exercised to reduce or eliminate calculated payout results. This mechanism places final control of plan payouts with our Board of Directors. Other compensation risk mitigants in place include robust stock ownership requirements for Executives, an established clawback policy, and no hedging or pledging of shares by employees.
In addition to senior management's review, members of our Human Resources Department conduct an annual assessment of all executive and non-executive incentive plans to ensure that they are aligned with our strategic business objectives. In 2018, our Human Resources representatives conducted a full review of the potential risks associated with our incentive plans and engaged in the following analysis:
The Human Resources representatives considered all of the foregoing information, specifically assessing each of our incentive plans to identify any provisions that might cause employees to act in a manner that would create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. No such provisions were identified.
In addition, the Compensation Committee engages in a comprehensive annual review of the Brunswick Performance Plan (BPP), our primary annual incentive plan, and its performance measures. The Compensation Committee assesses the BPP in conjunction with our overall strategic business objectives, as well as its forecast and budget. In 2018, the Committee also assessed each of our compensation programs, ensuring that they were consistent with and aligned with our short- and long-term business objectives. The Compensation Committee reviewed the 2018 BPP and determined that its plan design would effectively encourage employees to engage in appropriate and responsible behavior without unnecessary risk-taking that could have a negative impact on the Company. In addition, the BPP contains a negative discretion clause that expressly empowers the Compensation Committee to limit or reduce the BPP payout under the BPP's formula, based on extenuating circumstances and business outlook.
The majority of our non-executive incentive plans adopt the BPP's performance metrics, ensuring that the plans encourage and reward appropriate behavior throughout the organization. For those few incentive plans at the division level that do not mirror the BPP, Brunswick management performs a similar analysis of the plans on an annual basis in order to identify and remediate any potential negative behaviors that might result.
SUSTAINABILITY, SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
We remain committed to social and environmental responsibility and global sustainability. Our programs are active and gaining momentum as we continue to address environmental, social, and governance objectives. We have undertaken initiatives to reduce our environmental impact and to ensure a healthy and safe workplace. For example, for the eighth consecutive year, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council awarded our largest division, Mercury Marine, which maintains a significant manufacturing presence in Wisconsin a "Green Masters" designation in its program measuring a broad range of sustainability measures including energy and water conservation, waste management, community outreach, and education. Using our environmental management system processes, we continue to develop technologies to reduce engine and air emissions both in the production of our products and during their use. In recognition of its effort in this regard, Mercury Marine was awarded the Wisconsin Business Friend of the Environment Award in 2018 for the development of products that reduce the carbon footprint of boats and engines in use.
Further, across all Company operations, we actively maintain policies and best practices regarding workplace health and safety that promote the operation of our businesses in a manner that is environmentally responsible and protects the health and safety of our employees and the public. These include commitments from all of our employees through our Code of Conduct and commitments from our suppliers through our Supplier Code of Conduct. Please see our website, www.brunswick.com, under the "Ethics" and "Governance" sections to review these policies.
In 2019, Brunswick will undertake a broader, enterprise-wide sustainability initiative related to our marine operations, setting forth long-term goals for energy use, the environment, our products, and employee health and well-being. Since 2011, Mercury Marine has produced a sustainability report detailing specific program results and longer-term objectives related to energy, environment, products, and people. Mercury Marine has met or exceeded these goals. To learn more about Mercury Marine's sustainability program, see Mercury Marine's 2018 Sustainability Report on the Mercury Marine website at www.mercurymarine.com.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE
The table below summarizes the compensation we paid to non-employee Directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
The grant date fair value of awards in this column is as follows:
The following table sets forth the aggregate number of outstanding stock awards held by each non-employee Director as of December 31, 2018:
NARRATIVE TO DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE
ANNUAL FEES AND DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS
Non-employee Directors are entitled to an annual retainer of $225,000, with $95,000 payable in cash and $130,000 payable in Common Stock. In 2018, the Lead Independent Director received $50,000 paid in Brunswick stock. Effective in 2019, the Chairman of the Board will receive an annual retainer of $150,000 paid in Brunswick stock. The Fitness Transaction Leaders receive $15,000 per month, payable in cash, during the time period in which they serve in this capacity.
Chairs of committees and members of certain committees receive additional annual retainers paid in Brunswick stock, as follows:
For the portion of each Director's total annual fee paid in Common Stock, the number of shares is determined by the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the award and is reported in the "Stock Awards" column of the Director Compensation Table. The receipt of these shares may be deferred until a Director retires from the Board. Each Director may elect to have the cash portion of the annual fee paid as follows:
For Directors who elect to receive the cash portion in deferred Common Stock, the number of shares to be received upon retirement is determined by multiplying the cash amount by 1.2, then dividing that amount by the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the award.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
As set forth in the Principles, within five years after the date on which a Director first became a Director, and thereafter for so long as each Director is a Director of the Company, each Director is required to own Common Stock and deferred stock units of the Company equal to five times the amount of the Director's annual cash retainer. Once having met this threshold, if a Director falls below the threshold as a result of a decline in our stock price, the Director shall have a two-year period within which to once again achieve the threshold. We calculate compliance with these guidelines annually, using the average Brunswick stock price for the prior calendar year. As of December 31, 2018, all Directors were in compliance with the share ownership requirements.
BRUNSWICK PRODUCT PROGRAM
Directors are encouraged to use Brunswick products to enhance their understanding and appreciation of Brunswick's business. Directors receive an annual allowance of up to $30,000 which may be applied to purchase Brunswick products at discounted rates and/or fund expenses incurred with regard to the ownership of such products. The value of the products is included in the Directors' taxable income. Directors may also purchase additional Brunswick products at their own expense, at discounted rates.
STOCK HELD BY DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS
Each Director, each Executive Officer listed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, and all Directors and Executive Officers as a group owned the number of shares of Common Stock set forth in the following table as of March 11, 2019, with sole voting and investment power except as otherwise noted:
These shareholders known to us to beneficially own more than 5 percent of our outstanding Common Stock as of March 11, 2019 are:
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our Directors, Executive Officers, and beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of Common Stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Based on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company and written representations from the Company's Directors and Executive Officers, the Company believes that all forms were filed in a timely manner during 2018.

2018 SAY-ON-PAY EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION VOTE
At its 2018 Annual Meeting, shareholders overwhelmingly approved our "say on pay" proposal (shareholders cast 91.75 percent of votes for the proposal). We were pleased with this significant vote of confidence in our pay practices and did not make any direct changes to our compensation programs as a result of the vote. Nevertheless, we did make some changes to our compensation programs in 2018 to further reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy and align management compensation with shareholder interests.
KEY COMPENSATION DECISIONS IN 2018
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
All NEOs participated in the annual incentive plan called the Brunswick Performance Plan (BPP) which included divisional EBIT to reward division performance, while maintaining a meaningful portion of the award tied to overall Brunswick Earnings Per Share (EPS). Specifically, the 2018 BPP for the NEOs contained performance measures attributable to each of the divisions in addition to corporate EPS. On an enterprise basis, actual performance in 2018 was above the performance targets set for the 2018 BPP, and we paid NEOs aggregate awards under the plan at approximately 101 percent of target opportunity. For additional information on the annual incentive plan, see "Achievement of Targeted Results" on page 36 below.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
We grant performance-based equity in the form of Performance Shares to certain key senior executives, including each of the NEOs. Starting with the awards granted in 2015, performance underlying the awards is measured based on Cash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI) and Operating Margin and Brunswick's total shareholder return performance relative to the TSR of an established peer group, as measured over a three-year performance period. We believe Performance Shares strengthen our pay-for-performance philosophy and align management's long-term goals with our key strategic initiatives. Actual performance for the 2016 Performance Shares award fell below the three-year targets and awards paid under the plan were at 84 percent of target opportunity. For additional information, see page 38. In addition, the Company continues to provide Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) as part of equity compensation delivered to reinforce key retention initiatives and to align with shareholder interests.
MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION ACTIVITIES
The following management changes occurred during the year all of which was part of the Board's succession planning process:
OVERALL PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
The overall philosophy of our compensation programs for the NEOs and other senior executives is to encourage and reward the creation of sustainable, long-term shareholder value. Specifically, we have identified the following objectives to help realize this goal:

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DESIGN PRINCIPLES
In support of our objectives, the framework of our executive compensation programs incorporates the following design principles.
FOCUS ON THE CREATION OF LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Our senior executives are responsible for achieving long-term strategic goals. Accordingly, compensation is weighted more heavily towards rewarding long-term value creation for shareholders as an individual rises within the organization.
Our emphasis on long-term shareholder value creation is best illustrated in the following chart, which shows the portion of total targeted compensation that is attributable to our long-term incentive compensation and the portion attributable to other key elements of our compensation programs. As shown in the chart, long-term incentive compensation accounts for the largest percentage of overall compensation when compared to base salary and annual incentives (bonus). In addition, as a result of the compensation structure, a majority of senior executive compensation is deemed performance-based or "at risk," with such amounts constituting approximately 86 percent of Mr. Schwabero's total compensation and approximately 73 percent of total compensation for our other NEOs in 2018.
Below is a chart comparing the targeted compensation mix of the former CEO and other NEOs, excluding Mr. Irick:
PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR GOALS
We charge our senior executives with the responsibility for meeting our strategic, financial, and operational goals which we believe are key drivers to long-term shareholder value creation. As a result, we have linked executive compensation to business performance by establishing measurable business metrics against which we measure performance, and which the Board has determined are important to our key stakeholders.
We establish variable compensation targets (individual BPP targets and long-term incentive targets) for NEOs and other employees with reference to market median for each separate compensation component and evaluate overall competitiveness of Total Direct Compensation (TDC) (base salary plus annual bonus opportunity plus long-term incentives) for each individual as compared to the market TDC.
We base annual incentive metrics on a combination of division and overall Brunswick results. Long-term incentives are based on our consolidated results and total shareholder return (TSR).
Base a very high percentage of executive pay on performance through annual and long-term incentives
Require executives to achieve performance-based goals tied to shareholder return
Target median compensation levels and benchmark market data of our peer group when making executive compensation decisions
Apply strict share ownership guidelines to NEOs and Directors
Require vested shares from our equity compensation programs to be held until share ownership guidelines are met
Disclose complete information on annual and long-term incentives
Evaluate, and manage, risk in our compensation programs
Use an independent compensation consultant
Have an established clawback policy
Maintain double-trigger equity award vesting acceleration upon involuntary termination following a Change in Control (CIC)
Engage in a rigorous and thoughtful executive succession planning process with the Board
No excise tax gross-ups
No modified single-trigger or single-trigger CIC severance agreements (we only use double-trigger CIC severance provisions)
Expressly forbid option repricing not in accordance with plans already approved by shareholders
Expressly forbid exchanges of underwater options for cash in all of our active equity plans
No hedging of shares by our Directors or employees
No pledging of shares by our Directors or employees
No dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned Performance Shares
COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION
We recognize that, in order to attract and retain the level of talent that is essential to achieving our established objectives, we must maintain a competitive executive compensation program. Each year, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, provides a detailed peer analysis regarding proposed CEO compensation levels and other plan design elements. We are the largest domestic, publicly-traded company in the recreational marine industry, with total revenues significantly higher than other publicly-traded U.S. recreational boat manufacturers and as a result, there are no direct competitors in the compensation peer group. Criteria used to identify the peer group include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Companies with revenues that generally range from one-half to two times our          total annual revenue.       Publicly-traded manufacturing companies.      The peer group should be relatively stable. Companies historically have been eliminated  if they were acquired or if their revenue was outside the range referenced to the left.

[END TABLE]
Consistent with past practice, Brunswick assessed the appropriateness of the peer group during 2017, which resulted in changes to the peer group composition. The result of these peer company changes took effect for 2018 compensation planning purposes. The next review of the peer group is scheduled for later this year.
For all other NEOs, we assess the competitiveness of executive compensation every two years using manufacturing industry survey data purchased from Aon Hewitt. Each position is benchmarked based on scope of responsibilities, revenue size of the applicable business unit, and level within the organizational hierarchy. We design our target pay mix and total compensation opportunities to approximate the median of the market. In 2017, we completed a competitive benchmark assessment which confirmed that, on average, our target total direct compensation (base salary, annual bonus, and long-term incentives) for senior management positions, including the NEOs, approximates the median of competitive practice. We will complete the analysis again this year.
The chart to the right summarizes the CEO's target total direct compensation as compared to the median of the market data for his role as well as the average NEO target total direct compensation compared to the average applicable market data job matches for each of their respective roles. This chart reinforces that we are generally aligned with our market median pay philosophy.
INTERNAL EQUITY
We establish compensation ranges for positions with similar characteristics and scope of responsibility, including NEO positions. Balancing competitiveness with internal equity helps support management development and movement of talent throughout our worldwide operations. Differences in actual compensation between employees in similar positions result from individual performance, future potential, and division financial results. This effort also helps us promote talented managers to positions with increased responsibilities and provides meaningful developmental opportunities for our employees.
REWARD CORPORATE, DIVISION, AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE
Recognizing corporate, division, and individual performance in compensation helps reinforce the importance of working together and furthers our pay-for-performance philosophy. For 2018, we funded incentives for all participants based on the achievement of corporate and division performance goals and allocated incentives based on individual contributions. For those NEOs with division responsibility, we focused incentives on the financial performance of their divisions, but also included a meaningful portion tied to overall corporate results.

WHAT IS REWARDED?
We design NEO compensation to reward achievement of budgeted financial results, namely EPS, EBIT, Cash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI), Operating Margin, Brunswick total shareholder return (both absolute and on a relative basis), and individual performance.
ACHIEVEMENT OF TARGETED RESULTS
We established the 2018 BPP annual incentive formula to recognize and reward outstanding performance by both the overall Company and our divisions. Specifically, the BPP for the NEOs provides that funding is based on the achievement of corporate EPS and division-specific EBIT as shown in the following chart, other than for Mr. Irick, who did not receive a BPP payment because he separated from the Company before the end of the performance period.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CORPORATE   (Messrs.  Schwabero and  Metzger)    Boat Group: 16.67% EBIT 
 CORPORATE   (Messrs.  Schwabero and  Metzger)    Boat Group: 16.67% EBIT 
 CORPORATE   (Messrs.  Schwabero and  Metzger)    Boat Group: 16.67% EBIT 
 DIVISION   (Messrs. Foulkes  â€“ prorated for  time at Mercury  and Boat Group  during plan year,  Pfeifer â€“ Mercury,  and Bower â€“ Boat  Group)  50% EPS 50% EBIT of their Division 
 DIVISION   (Messrs. Foulkes  â€“ prorated for  time at Mercury  and Boat Group  during plan year,  Pfeifer â€“ Mercury,  and Bower â€“ Boat  Group)  50% EPS 50% EBIT of their Division 
 DIVISION   (Messrs. Foulkes  â€“ prorated for  time at Mercury  and Boat Group  during plan year,  Pfeifer â€“ Mercury,  and Bower â€“ Boat  Group)  50% EPS 50% EBIT of their Division 
[END TABLE]
Each of the NEOs also participates in the Performance Share plan, which rewards performance based on the achievement of both CFROI and Operating Margin over a three-year period in addition to a potential modifier at the end of the performance period based on Brunswick's three-year TSR performance against the TSR of certain companies in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) "Leisure Products" sub-industry.
The Compensation Committee believes that EPS and division EBIT are appropriate measures to use in our annual incentive plan. Earnings figures, specifically EPS, are widely tracked and reported by analysts and used as a measure to evaluate our performance. Division EBIT is important as it shows each division's contribution to our overall earnings performance. Both CFROI and Operating Margin are appropriate within the long-term performance share plan to measure how effectively we manage our cash and business to create long-term sustainable performance for our shareholders.
Our grants of Performance Shares and RSUs inherently reward absolute TSR because the ultimate earned value of each share will depend on our TSR during the performance/vesting period. In addition, the number of Performance Shares actually earned will depend on our relative TSR performance against other leisure products companies. We use absolute and relative TSR metrics because they align the earned compensation amounts with our market performance and our shareholders' experience.
STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION
Stock price appreciation is a significant component of total shareholder return and thus shareholder value creation. Stock price appreciation affects the value of our equity grants, including RSUs and Performance Shares.
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE
Individual performance affects base salary increases, annual incentives, and equity grant decision-making. As part of the compensation planning process, managers have the ability to adjust all elements of compensation based on the individual's attainment of annual goals and performance against critical competencies.
The Compensation Committee and the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors jointly assess the CEO's performance with input from all members of the Board of Directors. The CEO assesses performance of other NEOs with review by the Compensation Committee.
COMPENSATION ELEMENTS
We structure our compensation to reflect our business objectives and compensation philosophy. The particular elements that comprise our compensation programs for senior executives are summarized below along with an explanation of why we selected each compensation element; how the amount and formula are determined; and how decisions regarding that compensation element fit into our overall compensation objectives and programs.
BASE SALARY
Base salary is fixed compensation for our NEOs. It is designed to provide a minimum level of pay that reflects each executive's position and scope of responsibility, leadership skills, and individual performance, as demonstrated over time. When establishing an executive's base salary, we also target the median pay level within the market for positions with similar responsibilities and business size. A competitive base salary is important for attracting and retaining the executives needed to lead the business.
We review salaries on an annual basis to ensure they are externally competitive, reflect individual performance, and are internally equitable in relation to other Brunswick executives. We make salary adjustments on a periodic basis in response to market practices and to provide merit increases. Additionally, the base salary component serves as the foundation of executives' total pay, as incentives and benefits are generally computed as a function of base salary, which allows us to link performance and pay. As illustrated by the following chart, the average merit increase, excluding promotional or market adjustments, of NEO salary (excluding Mr. Irick) from 2016 to 2018 was 2.7 percent.
Average Merit Increase: 2.7%
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
Our annual incentive plan, the BPP, is the primary compensation element used to reward accomplishments against established business goals within a given year.
We set the BPP target funding based on budgeted performance for the year, as approved by the Board of Directors. The BPP limits funding to no more than 200 percent of target funding, with the Compensation Committee approving corporate and division plan metric amounts within a range from 0 percent to 200 percent based on its review of our performance against pre-established targets. The threshold payout level for bonus awards is 25% of final blended corporate and division performance. Target funding is equal to salary paid in the year multiplied by the target BPP percentage for each participant. For 2018, the percentage of salary targets under the BPP for NEOs ranged from 75 percent to 125 percent.
We determine individual awards using: overall funding as approved by the Compensation Committee; the individual's pro-rata portion of approved funding as adjusted for individual performance; and other factors deemed to be relevant. For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved NEO payouts ranging from 89 percent to 113 percent of target opportunity. The performance measures required to support funding for all NEOs in 2018 were:
and the following internal EBIT target levels for the business units:
The BPP plays an important role in our overall compensation structure, as it signals "what is important" and "what is expected" for the year from the standpoint of corporate, division, and/or individual results. Additionally, the BPP serves to focus executives on achieving current objectives, which are deemed necessary to attain long-term goals, and it establishes appropriate performance and annual incentives by rewarding divisions and individuals within those units for actual performance.
We enhanced the 2018 BPP terms and conditions to provide a pro-rata payment for those who meet the Rule of 70 or Age 62 (rule defined under the "Rule of 70 or Age 62" section on page 46) and retire during the second half of the plan year, subject to Committee approval for NEOs. Providing a pro-rata bonus payment (distributed at the same time as active employee bonus awards) provides flexibility for the timing of retirements and enables the Company to effectively transition key successors. This will be included in the plan terms for subsequent years.
After a thorough review of competitive practice and in consultation with FW Cook, the design of the 2019 annual incentive plan has evolved to support the progression of our marine strategy and the planned separation of the Fitness division in 2019. We believe this design prioritizes metrics that are important to shareholders while maintaining alignment to the key performance goals of the organization. The design of the 2019 BPP is as follows:
*FCF: Free Cash Flow
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
We continually monitor what might be the most appropriate design of our long-term incentive plans, taking into consideration both competitive practice and what would drive the most appropriate behavior of the participants. To reinforce the use of performance-based compensation, certain senior executives, including the NEOs, have had 50 percent of their target long-term incentive opportunity granted in Performance Shares and the balance in RSUs. The use of Performance Shares and RSUs in our long-term incentive mix is designed to align our incentive program with competitive pay practices, to reinforce pay for performance, and to encourage retention due to the three-year cliff vesting schedule for RSUs.
Performance Shares. In 2018, we granted all NEOs Performance Share awards. The 2018 Performance Shares are earned over a three-year performance period based on achievement of two financial metrics, with payout between 0 percent and 200 percent of the target opportunity. 75 percent of the award will be based on three-year annual average CFROI achievement and 25 percent will be earned based on three-year annual average Operating Margin attainment. The level of performance required for target payout is based on three-year strategic plan targets. The Compensation Committee believes these targets are challenging yet reasonably attainable. The final payout at the end of the three-year period may be increased or decreased by an additional 20 percent based on Brunswick's three-year TSR performance against the TSR of certain companies in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) "Leisure Products" sub-industry. Performance in the bottom quartile against the GICS comparator group reduces the Performance Share award payout by 20 percent and performance in the top quartile increases the Performance Share award payout by 20 percent, with a payout cap of 200 percent of target. Performance between the 25th and 75th percentile of the GICS comparator group results in no modification of the award payout. The design of the Performance Share award provides multiple benefits, including focusing management on the success of key strategic initiatives and their impact on CFROI and Operating Margin metrics, as well as strengthening the alignment with long-term shareholder interests through use of the TSR modifier at the conclusion of the three-year performance period.
The design of the 2019 Performance Share award is similar to that of 2018.
Completed 2016-2018 Performance Share Award. The 2016 Performance Share award was earned over a three-year performance period which ended on December 31, 2018. The plan design of these awards is similar to that of the 2018 Performance Share award described above. The targets required to support funding for all NEOs for the 2016-2018 performance period were:
Based on performance against these targets, the Compensation Committee approved an initial share determination of 84 percent of target opportunity. TSR performance against the established peer group for the performance period resulted in Company performance between the 25th and 75th percentile of the peer group. Therefore, this did not result in additional modification of +/- 20 percent of the award and the final award payout was 84 percent.
Other Long-Term Incentives. In addition to Performance Shares, we currently use RSUs. We believe that RSUs are an important component of our compensation structure because each award increases linkage to shareholder interests by rewarding stock price appreciation and tying wealth accumulation to performance. Additionally, RSUs help reinforce team performance, encourage senior executives to focus on long-term performance, and function as a retention incentive through the vesting period.
We base the size of long-term incentive awards for NEOs on a fixed dollar target that is established every two years when competitive benchmark compensation information is updated. The market median for long-term incentives for each NEO's position determines a reference point for the dollar value of the total equity grant target and is consistent with targeting median pay for consistently solid Company and individual performance. We determined the actual share award amounts for each NEO using a Monte Carlo valuation for Performance Shares and the Company's stock price on the date of the grant for RSUs.
SHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
In order to ensure continual alignment with our shareholders, we maintain share ownership requirements for our officers. This share ownership policy calculates minimum required ownership levels as a multiple of the officer's base salary.
The current NEO share ownership requirements for our actively serving NEOs are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
MANAGEMENT LEVEL:  Chief  Financial Officer and Designated Executive Officers  
[END TABLE]
Officers who do not meet the ownership requirements must retain shares having a value equal to 50 percent of the after-tax profit from the Common Stock acquired under our equity plans. For purposes of calculating compliance with the requirements, "shares owned" include shares directly owned, shares owned by immediate family members residing in the same household, shares held in trust, share equivalents held in our tax-qualified defined contribution plans and deferred compensation plans, and RSUs. Unexercised stock options and SARs and outstanding Performance Shares do not count as "shares owned." For those officers approaching retirement, ownership requirements are reduced as follows: 80 percent of target for those age 63; 60 percent of target for those age 64; and 50 percent of target for those age 65 and older.
The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with these share ownership requirements on an annual basis effective as of December 31. Messrs. Metzger and Pfeifer are currently in compliance with the stated requirements. Messrs. Foulkes and Bower will be subject to the retention ratio until they achieve the required ownership level. Please see the Narrative to Director Compensation Table for information regarding share ownership guidelines for Directors.
CLAWBACKS
The Compensation Committee can require the repayment of all or a portion of previous BPP awards as it deems appropriate in the event of certain misconduct, including misconduct that causes a restatement of financial results. In addition, for those who have entered into Terms and Conditions of Employment with Brunswick, including each of the NEOs, the Compensation Committee has expanded the types of payments the Company can recover in the event of a violation of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Terms and Conditions of Employment to include any severance payments received by the executive and any gain realized as a result of the exercise or vesting of equity awards beginning 12 months prior to termination.
ANTI-HEDGING AND ANTI-PLEDGING POLICY
No Director, NEO, or other employee may engage in hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Common Stock, including the purchase or sale of puts, calls, or options on Common Stock (other than options granted by Brunswick), or the use of any other derivative instruments to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Common Stock. In addition, no Director, NEO, or other employee may pledge Common Stock as collateral.
POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION
Post-employment compensation elements that are not currently offered to salaried employees in general are summarized below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 BRUNSWICK          RESTORATION PLAN   All NEOs  The Restoration Plan ensures that employees with covered compensation or retirement plan contributions above IRS qualified defined contribution plan limits receive the full amount of their intended retirement benefits. If an employee elects to participate in the Restoration Plan, 401(k) contributions and Brunswick's match on these contributions above the IRS limit are credited to this plan.

PERQUISITES AND OTHER BENEFITS
We extend certain benefits to NEOs that we do not offer to salaried employees in general. These programs help NEOs enhance their understanding of our products, protect their physical health, and maximize their productivity.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT
All NEOs maintain agreements setting forth their terms and conditions of employment (Agreements). The Agreements memorialize the "at will" nature of the employment relationship, and describe each Executive's duties, compensation, benefits, and perquisites. Additionally, the Agreements consolidate the restrictive covenants that exist during and after employment (e.g., non-competition, confidentiality, non-solicitation). Finally, the Agreements establish and limit the compensation and benefits to which an executive is entitled in the event of termination.
We believe that offering Agreements to our executives helps to ensure the retention of executive experience, skills, knowledge, and background for the benefit of the Company, and the efficient achievement of our long-term goals and strategy. Additionally, the Agreements reinforce and encourage the Executives' continued attention and dedication to duties without the distraction arising from the possibility of a Change in Control. The Agreements do not provide excise tax gross-ups.
DETERMINING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Decisions with respect to specific BPP awards, equity awards, and base salary increases for the current year are normally made at the first Compensation Committee and Board meeting of each year. At this meeting, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors also make decisions with respect to the prior year's performance and BPP funding. Base salary increases are generally effective as of the first full pay period in April.
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves equity grant terms and conditions and grant size for NEOs and other senior executives at its first meeting of the year, which is generally held following our public disclosure of our financial results for the prior year.
HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.
Based on that review and discussion, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors of Brunswick Corporation that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the Company's Proxy Statement to be filed in conjunction with the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting.
2018 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE
The table below summarizes the total compensation earned by each of our NEOs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Annual salaries as of December 31, 2018 were:
Effective upon his promotion to CEO on January 1, 2019, Mr. Foulkes's current base salary is $1,000,000.
For Mr. Metzger, the actuarial value of benefits under Brunswick's qualified pension plans and the Supplemental Pension Plan on December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was as follows:
Defined Contribution Plan Contributions: Brunswick contributions to defined contribution programs, including both qualified and non-qualified programs (to provide for contributions in excess of IRS limits) per the contribution formulas detailed in the Narrative to Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table are as follows:
Amounts contributed to the qualified plan include Company match and a Retirement Profit Sharing Contribution of four percent and six percent, respectively, on qualified plan limit earnings.
Mr. Irick forfeited the Brunswick contribution to his qualified plan account in Fiscal 2018 as a result of his termination of employment.
Product Program: Brunswick provides a product program for Company officers. This program is designed to encourage the use of our products to enhance understanding and appreciation of our businesses and identify product integration opportunities. Each year, officers are eligible to select products with an aggregate annual value of up to $30,000. The allowance may be applied toward the purchase of our products at the discounted rates established pursuant to the Brunswick Employee Purchase Program, as well as any freight costs, parts and accessories, service fees, and other expenses related to the ownership of the Brunswick products purchased. However, we do not reimburse executives for the associated tax liability as a result of the purchases or value received from the program.
The incremental cost of products selected, which is based on the discounted prices established pursuant to the Brunswick Employee Purchase Program, is as follows:
Life Insurance: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits loans to executive officers. As a result of this loan prohibition, combined with changes in taxation of split-dollar life insurance, we restructured existing Split-Dollar Life Insurance policies in 2004 such that the net present value cost to Brunswick did not increase. Mr. Metzger is now responsible for payment of the annual premium and keeping his policy current. Annual payments to Mr. Metzger in connection with his payment of premiums are:
Mr. Metzger is not provided any life insurance through the Company's basic life program for employees.
Brunswick paid an annual premium of $9,300 for Mr. Schwabero to continue a life insurance policy provided by his former employer which concluded on his retirement date.
Personal Usage of Company Aircraft: Mr. Schwabero utilized the Company aircraft for personal use on a limited basis. The incremental cost to Brunswick for such use during 2018 was $24,102. This incremental cost to the Company for use of the corporate aircraft is based on the variable operational costs of all flights, including fuel, maintenance, flight crew travel expense, catering, communications, and fees, including flight planning, ground handling, and landing permits.
Relocation: Mr. Bower received cost of living adjustments from his 2016 move during 2018. The incremental costs to Brunswick of these payments was $1,236. Brunswick also paid incremental costs relating to Mr. Irick's relocation in connection with his 2017 move of $16,287 during 2018. Mr. Irick also received tax gross-ups in the amount of $60 related to his relocation benefits.
Severance Payments: In November 2018, the Company made severance payments to Mr. Irick pursuant to his Separation Agreement as a result of his departure from the Company in the amount of $988,084, which amount includes a payment of $798,084 pursuant to Mr. Irick's Terms and Conditions of Employment ("Ts&Cs") and an additional payment of $190,000. For additional information related to Mr. Irick's Separation Agreement, see page 54.
Other Benefits: Each of the NEOs, except for Mr. Irick who separated from the Company on October 29, 2018, received the following perquisites and other personal benefits, none of which exceeded $25,000: (a) an annual executive physical examination; and (b) a service providing 24-hour access to immediate healthcare.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION AND AWARDS
Brunswick granted Performance Shares and RSUs to all NEOs in 2018 pursuant to the Brunswick Corporation 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. Performance Shares are generally granted annually and, if earned, typically vest 100 percent at the end of a three-year performance period. Brunswick generally grants RSUs annually and they typically vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date. The terms of the awards reflect the use of the "Rule of 70 or Age 62" (as described to the right), along with the inclusion of an additional provision that would pro-rate the grant in the event of termination before December 31 in the year the grant is awarded, provided the participant had met the appropriate retirement definition in the terms and conditions of the award. Providing for a "prorated" grant serves to keep the decision about retirement timing independent of the vesting schedule of equity-based compensation. Of the NEOs, Mr. Schwabero and Mr. Metzger meet the Rule of 70 or Age 62 provision. Please see the "Other Potential Post-Employment Payments" section for a description of the treatment of equity awards following an involuntary termination of employment or a Change in Control.
RULE OF 70 OR AGE 62
The terms and conditions of SARs, RSUs, and Performance Shares each provide for forfeiture of the award if an executive terminates employment before the end of the vesting period, except if: (i) the sum of the individual's age plus years of service is equal to or greater than 70; or (ii) the individual is age 62 or over (Rule of 70 or Age 62). Once the Rule of 70 or Age 62 is met, and if the employee's employment is terminated (other than for cause or due to death or permanent disability), the applicable awards are treated as follows:
Please see the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement for a detailed description of awards granted to the NEOs during 2018.

2018 OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED
2018 PENSION BENEFITS
NARRATIVE TO PENSION BENEFITS TABLE
Supplemental Pension Plan: Effective December 31, 2009, the Company froze the Supplemental Pension Plan and ceased all benefit accruals. Participation thereafter in any supplemental pension plan has been through the Brunswick Restoration Plan.
The Supplemental Pension Plan is described on page 40.
The formula for determining benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan is the same formula used for the qualified pension plans, specifically a formula based upon age, years of participation in the plan up to 30 years, and the average of the three highest consecutive years' earnings (salaries, annual BPP, and commissions, but excluding payouts under the Strategic Incentive Plan, which has been eliminated).
2018 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
RESTORATION PLAN
2005 ELECTIVE DEFERRED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
2005 AUTOMATIC DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
NARRATIVE TO NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLES
The Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation tables show amounts deferred in 2018 under Restoration (non-qualified plan to provide for contributions in excess of IRS limits), the Elective Deferred Incentive Compensation, and Automatic Deferred Compensation plans and includes previous deferrals.
Under the Restoration Plan, participants may defer up to 40 percent of their base salary and BPP awards. These deferrals are credited with earnings and losses based on the rate of return of mutual funds selected by the participant. The investment options and Company matching formula mirror those of the qualified 401(k) plan, which the participant manages in the same manner. Brunswick contributes to this plan according to the following formula:
Under the 2005 Elective Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan, participants were allowed to defer up to 100 percent of BPP awards in either cash or stock. The Company calculated the value of cash deferrals based on the rate of return of mutual funds selected by the participant. The investment options mirror those of the qualified 401(k) plan and participants manage fund elections in the same manner. The Company calculated the value of stock deferrals on the same basis as Brunswick Common Stock. In 2008, the Company suspended participation in the plan. Distributions under the 2005 Elective Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan will be made as soon as administratively practicable after the participant's termination from the Company or in accordance with the participant's stated elections.
Under the 2005 Automatic Deferred Compensation Plan, participants are required to defer certain compensation in excess of $1.5 million to protect the tax deductibility to the Company of such compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. For cash balances, deferred cash equivalent balances are credited with: (i) an interest rate equal to the greater of the prime rate at JP Morgan Chase plus two percent, or Brunswick's short-term borrowing rate; or (ii) returns on securities selected by the executive. For amounts deferred in stock, the account is credited with the number of share units equal to the number of shares of Company stock as of the date on which the shares would otherwise have been paid. Distributions of deferrals are made as soon as reasonably practicable after the six-month anniversary of the participant's date of termination.
As discussed on page 40, this plan has been amended to cease deferrals of compensation earned on or after January 1, 2018, except for incentive awards that were outstanding prior to November 2, 2017.
The rates of return in 2018 for each fund in the Restoration Plan and 2005 Elective Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan are stated in the following table:
OTHER POTENTIAL POST-EMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS
Brunswick has entered into severance and Change in Control agreements which are incorporated in the Terms and Conditions of Employment (Agreements) with each NEO.
Below is a discussion of the benefits that our NEOs who were actively employed with the Company on December 31, 2018 would have received upon a Change in Control or termination of employment under various circumstances on such date. Mr. Irick is not included due to his termination of employment with the Company prior to such date, but a discussion of the severance benefits that Mr. Irick actually became entitled to upon his termination of employment is included under "Separation Arrangement with Mr. Irick" on page 54 of this Proxy Statement.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT
The Agreements confirm that employment is at will and outline the NEO's roles and responsibilities and compensation, benefits, and eligibility for certain perquisites provided in exchange for their services. The Agreements also contain provisions regarding termination of employment and reflect a "double-trigger" Change in Control severance and equity provision (effective upon termination of employment by the Company following a Change in Control of the Company) for all NEOs, including the CEO.
The Company modified its equity vesting provision for 2016 equity grants such that they will be subject to double-trigger vesting. Therefore a termination must occur following a Change in Control in order for the equity awards to vest. This modification was to align with competitive best practice. There are no longer any legacy awards with single-trigger vesting upon a Change in Control as the 2015 equity awards (which vested in 2018) were the last awards granted with single-trigger vesting.
With Mr. Foulkes's promotion to CEO effective January 1, 2019, his terms and conditions of employment reflect his new position and mirror the benefits outlined below for Mr. Schwabero as it relates to severance benefits in the event of a Change in Control or a qualifying termination other than following a Change in Control. The information below provides his terms and conditions of employment in place as of December 31, 2018. Upon retirement on December 31, 2018, Mr. Schwabero did not receive any additional separation benefits from the Company.
CHANGE IN CONTROL AND SEVERANCE
Each NEO is entitled to certain severance benefits in the event of a Change in Control (as defined below), if Brunswick terminates his employment for reasons other than for Cause (as defined below) or disability or if the executive terminates for Good Reason (as defined below):
The three (3) times severance calculation is a grandfathered practice and new officers to the Company are set at two (2) times severance calculation following a Change in Control.
In addition to the payments described above, in each scenario, the NEO would be entitled to receive any annual BPP award earned for the preceding year that had not yet been paid at the time of termination as well as outplacement services.
In 2012, we eliminated the practice of providing indemnification or any "gross-up" of taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on "excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code). As a result, all executives at Brunswick who have an Agreement, including each NEO, are no longer entitled to a gross-up for any excise tax imposed on "excess parachute payments." Instead, such executives will either be required to pay the excise tax or have their payments reduced if it would be more favorable to them on an after-tax basis.
Brunswick may terminate the Agreements upon six months' notice, except that after a Change in Control, Brunswick may not terminate the Agreements until the second anniversary of the Change in Control.
The Agreements contain non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants effective during the two-year period following termination of employment for the CEO, and for 18 months following termination for all other NEOs, and non-disclosure and non-disparagement restrictive covenants effective at all times. Upon termination following a Change in Control, the non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants are not applicable. In the event of a violation of the restrictive covenants, we may recover any severance payments received by the executive and any gain realized as a result of the exercise or vesting of equity awards beginning 12 months prior to termination and ending on the date that the Company makes full recovery of such payments.
The terms of the Agreements require the NEOs to execute a general release. Severance benefits are not available for those individuals terminating due to retirement, death, long-term disability, or for Cause.
Termination for "Cause" means the NEO's:
"Good Reason" means any of the following without the NEO's express written consent:
The Good Reason provision protects executives from being effectively demoted or having their pay reduced in an effort to force them to quit.
The definition of Change in Control includes: (i) the acquisition of 25 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of Brunswick by any person other than an employee benefit plan of Brunswick; (ii) the failure of the incumbent Board of Directors to constitute a majority of Brunswick's Board, excluding new directors who (a) are approved by a vote of at least 50 percent of the members of the incumbent Board and (b) did not join the Board following a contested election of directors; (iii) a merger of Brunswick with another corporation, other than a merger in which Brunswick's shareholders receive at least 60 percent of the voting stock outstanding after the merger or a merger effected to implement a recapitalization of Brunswick in which no person acquires more than 25 percent of Brunswick's voting stock and the Board is comprised of a majority incumbent directors; or (iv) a complete liquidation or dissolution of Brunswick.
PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER TERMINATION SCENARIOS
The following tables show our estimated payment obligations resulting from effective termination before and after a Change in Control, using December 31, 2018 as the hypothetical termination date.
INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OTHER THAN FOR DEATH, DISABILITY, OR CAUSE
TERMINATION FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL
SEPARATION ARRANGEMENT WITH MR. IRICK
On October 29, 2018, Mr. Irick's employment terminated and Brunswick and Mr. Irick entered into a Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") which contained a mutual release of claims and provided, among other things:
For additional information, see the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2018.
CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
For 2018, the ratio of CEO total compensation ($8,243,580) to the median worker total compensation ($50,543) is 163:1. The ratio is a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner consistent with applicable SEC rules.
2018 Median Employee Review
We evaluated our workforce as of October 1, 2018 and determined that there were no changes to our employee composition or compensation arrangements that would warrant a re-calculation of the median employee or would significantly affect our pay ratio calculation. We conducted a workforce comparison review between 2017 and 2018 and determined that there have been no significant changes in the median employee compensation level. We did provide for an exclusion for 600 employees who were previously employees of Power Products, which we acquired in August 2018. Therefore, we are utilizing the same median employee that was identified last year utilizing the methodology described below. We calculated the 2018 compensation details for the same median employee utilizing the methodology that is used for NEOs as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table to determine the pay ratio.
Median Employee Determination
As indicated above, for the 2018 calculation, we are using the same median employee that was used for 2017. To determine the median employee in 2017, we completed the data gathering and analysis for our global employee population. We utilized a measurement date of October 1, 2017, and used a total compensation definition that consisted of actual base pay earnings, overtime earnings, and annual incentives paid to all employees from the beginning of the 2017 year through the measurement date. We annualized pay for those who commenced work or were on an unpaid leave of absence during 2017. This data was gathered for our entire global workforce to identify the median employee, except that an exclusion was made for 51 employees who were previously employees of Lankhorst Taselaar, which we acquired in September 2017.
Brunswick Total Rewards Philosophy Overview
As part of Brunswick's total rewards philosophy, we strive to attract and retain our workforce with market competitive compensation and benefits which will motivate performance and provide alignment with the Brunswick strategic goals for the organization. We strive to be an employer of choice and provide a differentiated and fulfilling employment experience to each of our 16,000 talented employees located in 32 countries, of which 60% are hourly, manufacturing, and distribution employees. Part of that strategy is to provide a compensation package that is determined based on the individual's role within the organization. We set pay levels based on the respective labor markets in which our various employee segments operate to ensure that we can attract and retain the best talent for each role within the organization. We believe that our current talent and workforce compensation strategy meets the needs of the business, shareholders, and employees.
What am I voting on? Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of our NEOs on an advisory basis.
Voting Recommendation: Your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of compensation of our Named Executive Officers.
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Board of Directors seeks your advisory vote to approve our compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers (commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay vote"). We encourage shareholders to review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 31 to 54 of this Proxy Statement. We ask that you approve the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying tables contained in this Proxy Statement. Because this vote is advisory in nature, it will not be binding on the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee, or the Company; however, the Board and the Compensation Committee will closely review the voting results and carefully consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions regarding executive compensation.
Consistent with the direction of our shareholders at our 2017 annual meeting, the say-on-pay vote will continue to be held on an annual basis. At our 2018 annual meeting, we received overwhelming shareholder approval on the "say on pay" proposal (91.75 percent of votes were cast for the proposal). We were pleased with this significant vote of confidence in our pay practices and made no direct changes to our compensation programs as a result of this vote.
We have a long-standing tradition of delivering financial results for our shareholders and our customers and aligning pay with those results. We believe we are a market leader in the marine and fitness industries, with business locations in many countries. Our executive team continues to successfully execute its growth plan, generating strong free cash flow and demonstrating outstanding operating leverage.
We have designed our executive compensation programs to drive strong financial results and to attract, reward, and retain a highly experienced, successful senior management team to achieve our corporate objectives and increase shareholder value. We believe our programs are structured in the best manner possible to support our Company and our business objectives and we believe that they strike an appropriate balance between implementing responsible, measured pay practices and providing effective incentives designed to encourage our executives to perform at their best. This balance is illustrated by the following factors, which we urge you to consider:

AUDIT-RELATED MATTERS
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following is the Audit Committee report with respect to Brunswick's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Overview of Audit Committee Function: The Audit Committee, composed of independent directors who are all Audit Committee financial experts under SEC rules, oversees Brunswick's financial reporting process. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
Audit Committee Charter: The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, a copy of which is available on Brunswick's website, www.brunswick.com.
Independence of Audit Committee Members: The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are independent, within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
Review with Management: The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed Brunswick's audited financial statements with management.
Review and Discussions with Independent Auditors: The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, termination, compensation, and oversight of Brunswick's independent auditors. Deloitte and Touche, LLP was Brunswick's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and has served in that capacity since 2014. The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of Brunswick's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of Brunswick's internal control over financial reporting, the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC, and other professional standards and regulatory requirements currently in effect.
The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures from Deloitte required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Deloitte's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Deloitte its independence from Brunswick. The Audit Committee has also reviewed the non-audit services Deloitte provided and has considered whether the provision of those services was compatible with maintaining Deloitte's independence.
Conclusion: Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to Brunswick's Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Brunswick's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

FEES INCURRED FOR DELOITTE SERVICES
Brunswick incurred the following fees for services rendered by Deloitte, our current independent registered public accounting firm, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018:
APPROVAL OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee is responsible for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services that our independent registered public accounting firm performs; accordingly, the Committee pre-approved Deloitte's services in 2017 and 2018. The Audit Committee has adopted a two-tiered approach for pre-approving fees. Each year it approves an overall budget for specified audit and non-audit services, after which the Audit Committee must pre-approve either: (i) any proposed specified service that would result in total fees exceeding the budget; or (ii) any proposed service not specified in the budget.
Voting Recommendation: Your Board of Directors and the Audit Committee recommend     a vote FOR the approval and ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's Independent Registered Public     Accounting Firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte as the independent registered public accounting firm for Brunswick and its subsidiaries for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although it is not required to seek shareholder approval of this appointment, the Board of Directors has determined that, in keeping with the principles of sound corporate governance, the appointment will be submitted for ratification by the shareholders. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee recommend that shareholders ratify the appointment of Deloitte as the independent registered accounting firm for Brunswick and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will investigate the basis for the negative vote and will reconsider its appointment in light of the results of such investigation.
Representatives of Deloitte will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be afforded an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to respond to questions from shareholders.
2019 will be the sixth year that Deloitte is anticipated to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for Brunswick and its subsidiaries.
