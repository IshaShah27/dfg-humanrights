Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement 
March 28, 2019 
Dear Stockholder: 
On behalf of the Board of Directors and the management of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., I am pleased to invite you to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Annual Meeting will be held at the St. Regis Atlanta, Eighty-Eight West Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30305 on Friday, May 17, 2019 at 8:30 a.m., local time. 
The attached Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement describe the formal business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors and senior officers, as well as representatives from our independent registered public accounting firm, will be present to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
Again this year, we are delivering proxy materials for the Annual Meeting under the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Notice and Access" rules. These rules permit us to furnish proxy materials, including the attached Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report, to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. The rules also allow us to help the environment by reducing the consumption of paper, energy and other natural resources and to lower our printing and distribution expenses. Our stockholders will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"), which provides instructions on how to access and review all of our proxy materials on the Internet. Our stockholders will not receive printed copies unless they request them. The Notice also explains how you may submit your proxy on the Internet. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided or vote telephonically or electronically using the telephone and Internet voting procedures described on the proxy card at your earliest convenience.

Corporate Governance Developments and Highlights 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The current directors that are nominated for re-election will serve a  one-year term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, has determined that ten of our  eleven director nominees are independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange LLC (NYSE) and the governance guidelines and independence policy adopted by our Board of Directors.   Our Board of Directors continues to be led by Mr. Jeffrey C. Sprecher, who serves as  Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Mr. Frederic V. Salerno, who has been elected as lead independent director for 2019. Mr. Salerno has served as the lead independent director of our Board of Directors since 2008. As lead  independent director, Mr. Salerno presides at all executive sessions of the non-management directors and helps set the agenda for our Board of Director meetings.   There have been several important developments regarding the composition of our Board of Directors  and governance matters.      The Board of Directors has nominated eleven director nominees. The Board  of Directors believes that the eleven director nominees collectively have the expertise and diversity of experience to effectively oversee and guide our business.      As part of the Board of Directors focus on board refreshment,  including a focus on diversity and on succession for Board leadership positions, three of our long standing directors did not stand for re-election in 2016. Because the Board of Directors voted to increase the  total number of directors constituting the Board from eleven to twelve in December 2017, we were able to add four new directors to our Board of Directors between September 2016 and the end of 2017 to fill specific needs deemed important by our  Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and our stockholders.      Ann Cairns, who joined our Board of Directors in March 2017, will not be  standing for re-election due to a conflict of interest that exists between Mastercard, where Ms. Cairns is currently employed as Vice Chair, and Bakkt Holdings, LLC, a majority owned subsidiary of  ICE.

Highlights of Our 2018 Performance 
ICE continued to deliver strong annual operating results as evidenced by the following 2018 performance highlights: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Thirteenth consecutive year of record revenue and adjusted earnings, including record financial results each year as a  public company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record 2018 consolidated revenues less transaction-based expenses of $5 billion and 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per  share ("Adjusted EPS") of $3.59, up 21% year-over-year;1  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Returned nearly $1.8 billion to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2018, more than any year in our  history, and increased first quarter 2019 quarterly dividend by 15% relative to 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Three-year total stockholder return ("TSR") of 53% (based on stock price increase from $51.25 on December 31,  2015 to $75.33 on December 31, 2018, plus quarterly dividend payments); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Expanded and strengthened markets served and range of data and risk management services through organic growth and strategic  acquisitions.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Developments and Highlights 
We continue to maintain a well-balanced and performance-based executive compensation program, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• More than 85% of named executive officer ("NEO") targeted compensation delivered through variable,  performance-based compensation programs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• More than 65% of NEO targeted compensation delivered through equity compensation programs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash bonus opportunity and performance stock units ("PSUs") capped at 200% of the established target  opportunity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mandatory and competitive stock ownership requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A robust compensation clawback policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in control protection that requires a "double-trigger" (i.e., there must be a change in control and a  termination of the executive's employment) for payment to be provided; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No "golden parachute" excise tax gross-up provisions in employment  agreements with our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
In February 2019, annual bonuses for 2018 performance were paid at 102% of target for our NEOs. Additionally, in February 2019, performance achievement for the PSUs granted in January 2018 that are subject to a one-year EBITDA performance measure (the "EBITDA-based PSUs") was calculated at 102% due to our 2018 EBITDA2 growth exceeding our pre-established goals and such awards were earned at 112% of target for our executives, including our NEOs. ICE had historically used a one-year EBITDA performance measure for the PSU plan. Beginning in 2017, we introduced a PSU with a performance measure that is tied to our three-year TSR performance against the S&P 500 (the "TSR-based PSUs") to introduce a longer-term measure in our performance-based stock awards. In 2019, we increased the portion of our NEOs' long-term incentive compensation delivered in the form of three-year TSR PSUs and decreased the portion delivered in the form of one-year EBITDA PSUs. Each of these items is discussed in more detail below in Compensation Matters — Compensation Discussion & Analysis. 
We believe that our mix of cash/non-cash and short-term/long-term incentives provides an appropriate balance between our longer-term business objectives and shorter-term retention and competitive needs. We also believe that providing the majority of our NEOs' compensation in the form of long-term equity awards, when combined with our clawback policy and stock ownership requirements, both of which are described below, has the additional benefit of discouraging employees from taking inappropriate risks. 
You should review Compensation Matters — Compensation Discussion & Analysis and Compensation Matters — Executive Compensation below and the compensation-related tables for a complete understanding of our compensation program, including a detailed review of the philosophy, process, considerations and analysis involved in the determination of compensation granted or paid to our NEOs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   Adjusted EPS is a non-generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP")  metric. Please refer to the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in ICE's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") on February 7, 2019 for the equivalent GAAP term and reconciliation to the GAAP term.  
2   EBITDA is "earnings before interest and other non-operating income and  expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization," which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and serves as a performance target for ICE. For information on the calculation of EBITDA, please see Compensation  Matters — Compensation Discussion & Analysis — 2018 Direct Compensation — Equity Compensation below.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Board of Directors 
Under our current Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our current Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Board of Directors sets the number of directors who may serve on the Board of Directors through resolutions adopted by a majority of the directors then in office. The size of our Board of Directors is currently set at twelve directors and presently consists of twelve directors. We have nominated eleven of our current twelve directors for re-election at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and plan to reduce our board size to eleven directors after the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of our nominees, if elected, will serve for a one-year term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Each director will hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until the director's earlier resignation or removal. 
Each of our directors is elected by majority vote in an uncontested election. A director who fails to receive a majority of "FOR" votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote will be required to tender his or her resignation to our Board of Directors. Our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will then act on an expedited basis to determine whether to accept the director's resignation and will submit such recommendation for prompt consideration by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors expects the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain from participating in any decision regarding that resignation. Our Board of Directors and our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation. 
Nominees for Election as Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting 
On the recommendation of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, our Board of Directors has nominated the persons named below for election as directors at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each to serve for a one-year term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of the nominees currently are members of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, has determined that each of our non-employee directors is independent in accordance with NYSE listing standards and our Board of Directors Governance Guidelines as described below under Corporate Governance — Structure and Role of Our Board — Independent Non-Employee Directors. 
Each of the nominees has confirmed that he or she expects to be able to continue to serve as a director until the end of his or her term. If, however, at the time of the Annual Meeting, any of the nominees named below is not available to serve as a director (an event which the Board of Directors does not anticipate), all the proxies granted to vote in favor of such director's election will be voted for the election of such other person or persons, if any, recommended by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of directors than the eleven nominees named in this Proxy Statement. For a discussion of our policy regarding qualification and nomination of director candidates, see Corporate Governance — Structure and Role of Our Board — Nomination of Directors below.

In 2018, our Board of Directors held seven meetings, the Audit Committee held six meetings, the Compensation Committee held five meetings, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee held four meetings and the Risk Committee held four meetings. In addition, our non-management directors met periodically in executive session without management participation, as required by NYSE listing standards. Mr. Salerno has been appointed by the Board of Directors as the non-management lead independent director presiding at these meetings. 
As a matter of Board policy, it is expected that each director will be available to attend substantially all of the meetings of the Board of Directors and any committees on which the director serves. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors and meetings of the committees of which he or she is a member. As a matter of policy, it is expected that each director and nominee will attend the Annual Meetings of Stockholders. Eleven of our twelve directors at the time of last year's annual meeting attended the meeting in-person and one director attended the annual meeting telephonically.

12  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
STRUCTURE AND ROLE OF OUR BOARD 
Independent Non-Employee Directors 
The Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. Board of Directors Governance Guidelines (the "Governance Guidelines") were adopted by our Board of Directors. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Governance Guidelines, which are described below, provide that a majority of our directors must be "independent directors" and specify independence standards consistent with NYSE listing standards. Assuming the election of the nominees to the Board of Directors, all of our directors holding office, with the exception of Mr. Sprecher, will be independent directors. Our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, has determined that each non-management director and nominee is independent in accordance with NYSE listing standards, our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Independence Policy of the Board of Directors of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (the "Independence Policy") and our Governance Guidelines, and does not have any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. 
In making their independence determinations, our Board of Directors and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee considered transactions, if any, between each non-employee director and ICE and determined that there are no transactions that give rise to any independence issues. 
Requirements for Directors 
Our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that no person who is subject to any statutory disqualification (as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act) may be permitted to serve as a director on our Board of Directors. 
Board Evaluations and Succession Planning 
Each year, the members of the Board of Directors and each Board committee conduct a confidential oral assessment of their performance with a member of our legal department. As part of the evaluation process, the Board reviews its overall composition, including director tenure, board leadership structure, diversity and individual skill sets, to ensure it serves the best interests of stockholders and positions the company for future success. The results of the oral assessments are then summarized and communicated back to the appropriate chairpersons and our lead independent director. After the evaluations, the Board, committees and management work to improve upon any issues or focus points disclosed during the evaluation process. We believe that conducting these evaluations through a discussion with our Board members leads to more meaningful results that are more likely to result in changes when compared to conducting evaluations through a written process or completion of a questionnaire. As part of the evaluation process, each committee reviews its charter annually. 
Our Board is committed to effective board succession planning and refreshment, including having honest and difficult conversations with individual directors as may be deemed necessary. We may have these conversations in connection with ongoing Board self-evaluations, Board refreshment processes, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and Board consideration of the annual slate of Board nominees. As a result of these different processes in the past, directors have decided (for personal or professional reasons) or have been asked (for reasons related to their ongoing contributions to the Board and Company) not to stand for re-election at the next annual meeting of stockholders. It is expected that such refreshment practices will continue in the future. 
Nomination of Directors 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for approving candidates for board membership and has delegated the screening and recruitment process to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee. In furtherance of this process, our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and Board of Directors have adopted the Independence Policy and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee Charter. The Independence Policy and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee Charter do not set specific, minimum qualifications that nominees must meet, but rather specify that each nominee should be evaluated on his or her individual merit taking into account the factors described below. 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee seeks to create a Board of Directors that consists of a diverse group of qualified individuals that function effectively as a group. Qualified candidates for director are those who, in the judgment of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, possess strong personal attributes and relevant business experience to assure effective service on our Board of Directors. Personal attributes considered by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee when evaluating a board candidate include leadership, integrity, ethics, contributing nature, independence, interpersonal skills and effectiveness. Experience and qualifications considered by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee when evaluating a board candidate include financial acumen, general business experience, industry knowledge, diversity of viewpoints, special business experience and expertise in an area relevant to ICE. When the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee reviews a potential new candidate, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee looks specifically at the candidate's qualifications in light of the needs of our Board of Directors and ICE at that time given the then current make-up of our Board of Directors. 
2019 Proxy Statement  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  13
STRUCTURE AND ROLE OF OUR BOARD 
Diversity is an important factor in our consideration of potential and incumbent directors. Our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee considers a number of demographics including, but not limited to, race, gender, ethnicity, culture and nationality in seeking to develop a board that, as a whole, reflects diverse viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experiences and expertise. When the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee has conducted recent searches for new directors, including through the use of a third-party recruiting firm, it has focused on pools of qualified directors that have also added additional diversity to the ICE Board and subsidiary boards, when the director candidates' skill sets qualify them to also serve on a subsidiary board of directors. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee considers the same factors in determining whether to re-nominate an incumbent director. Diversity is also considered as part of the annual Board evaluation. 
We believe that ICE benefits from having directors with diverse viewpoints, backgrounds, experiences, skill sets and other demographics. As noted above, one of the factors that the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee considers in identifying and evaluating a potential nominee is the extent to which the nominee would add to the diversity of our Board, and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee assesses the composition of our Board and how a nominee would enhance that diversity. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety of methods to identify and evaluate nominees for director. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses the appropriate size of the Board of Directors and whether any vacancies on the Board of Directors are expected. In the event that vacancies are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will seek to identify director candidates, subject to the restrictions described below, based on input provided by a number of sources, including: (i) Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee members; (ii) other directors; (iii) management; and (iv) our stockholders. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee also has the authority to consult with or retain advisors or search firms to assist in the identification of qualified director candidates and used a search firm over the last year to assist in the Board's desire to increase diversity on the Board of Directors. 
Once director candidates have been identified, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate each candidate in light of his or her qualifications and credentials, and any additional factors that the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee deems necessary or appropriate, including those set forth above. Qualified prospective candidates will be interviewed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and at least one member of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee. The full Board of Directors will be kept informed of the candidate's progress. Using input from such interviews and other information obtained by it, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate whether a prospective candidate is qualified to serve as a director and, if so qualified, will seek the approval of the full Board of Directors for the nomination of the candidate or the election of such candidate to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors. 
Existing directors who are being considered for re-nomination will be re-evaluated by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee based on each director's satisfaction of the qualifications described above and his or her prior performance as a director. All candidates submitted by stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as candidates recommended from other sources, provided that the procedures set forth below under Corporate Governance — Structure and Role of Our Board — Stockholder Recommendations for Director Candidates have been followed. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors shall nominate for election or re-election as directors only candidates who agree to tender, promptly following the annual meeting at which they are elected or re-elected as a director, irrevocable resignations that will be effective upon (i) the failure to receive the required vote at the next annual meeting at which they stand for re-election and (ii) acceptance by our Board of Directors of such resignation. Our Board of Directors shall fill director vacancies and newly created directorships only with candidates who agree to tender promptly following their appointment to the Board of Directors the same form of resignation tendered by other directors in accordance with the Governance Guidelines promulgated by our Board of Directors. 
All of the current nominees for directors recommended for election by the stockholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting are current members of the Board of Directors. Based on the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee's evaluation of each nominee's satisfaction of the qualifications described above and their past performance as directors, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee has decided to recommend the nominees for re-election and the Board of Directors has approved such recommendation. For the reasons specified in the profile of each director identified above under Corporate Governance — Proposal 1 — Election of Directors — Nominees for Election as Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting, our Board has concluded that each director nominee should be re-elected to our Board of Directors. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee has not received any nominations from stockholders for the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Governance Guidelines provide for (i) the role of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be combined, (ii) a lead independent director and (iii) strong active independent directors. Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Chairman of the Board, or our lead independent director if the Chairman is unavailable, presides over meetings of the Board of Directors, presides over meetings of stockholders, consults and advises the Board of Directors and its committees on our business and affairs, and performs such other duties as may be assigned by the Board. The Chairman of the Board, in consultation with the lead independent director, establishes the 
14  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
STRUCTURE AND ROLE OF OUR BOARD 
agenda for Board of Director meetings and facilitates constructive and useful communication between management and the Board of Directors. We provide agendas to our lead independent director in advance of meetings and solicit input from the lead independent director regarding topics of discussion and agenda items. Our independent directors have elected Mr. Salerno as the lead independent director for 2019, a position he has held since 2008. As lead independent director, Mr. Salerno presides at all executive sessions of the non-management directors. 
Our Chief Executive Officer is in charge of our business affairs, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board of Directors and its committees and subject to such powers as reserved by the Board of Directors. Mr. Sprecher serves as both Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and he is the only member of our management team that serves on the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors believes that this leadership structure — a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, a lead independent director, active and strong non-employee directors, and committees led and comprised of independent directors — is the most effective structure for us. 
Our Board of Directors believes that the Chief Executive Officer is in the best position to most effectively serve as the Chairman of the Board for many reasons as he is closest to many facets of our business, including his frequent contact with our customers, regulators and stockholders. In addition, his direct involvement in the strategic and day-to-day management of our business ensures timely communication with the Board of Directors on critical business matters, which is important given the complexity and global nature of our business. Further, much of our business is conducted through our operating subsidiaries, which are overseen by their own boards of directors on which Mr. Sprecher serves. Serving in multiple roles allows Mr. Sprecher to be a primary point of contact for these boards of directors and facilitates effective communication regarding our strategic goals, key issues and topics of importance. The Board of Directors believes this structure has functioned well, produced strong financial and operating results, and effectively balances a highly capable management team with appropriate safeguards and oversight by non-employee directors. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing ICE's risk management process, which includes management of general risks as well as particular risks facing our business. With the assistance of our Audit and Risk Committees, the Board oversees that our assets are properly safeguarded, appropriate financial and other controls are maintained, and our business is conducted prudently and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our corporate governance guidelines. In this regard, our Board of Directors seeks to understand and oversee critical business risks and does not view the risks facing our business in isolation. While risks are considered in business decision-making and as part of our overall business strategy, the Board of Directors recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all business risk. Our Board of Directors believes that purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for our business to be competitive on a global basis, to continue to grow and diversify, and to achieve our overall business objectives. 
While the Board of Directors oversees ICE's risk management practices, our management team is charged with managing risks. We have adopted internal processes and internal controls to identify and manage operational and financial risks. The Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls and the risk management program and management communicates routinely with the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee on the risks identified and how they are being managed. 
Directors may, and often do, communicate directly with senior management on any areas of our business for which they would like additional information. 
Board of Directors Governance Guidelines 
We have adopted the Governance Guidelines that guide the Board of Directors on matters of corporate governance, including:

STRUCTURE AND ROLE OF OUR BOARD 
The Governance Guidelines also provide that non-management directors meet in executive sessions without the participation of management at all regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors as deemed necessary and at any other time as necessary to fulfill the Board of Directors' responsibilities. In addition, the Governance Guidelines also state that if all non-management directors are not independent directors, then the independent directors will meet at least once annually. Our Governance Guidelines require that our directors limit their other directorships of public companies to five. Further, our Governance Guidelines require that employee directors tender their resignation from the Board of Directors coincident with their termination, resignation or retirement as employees. 
A copy of the Governance Guidelines is available on our website at www.intercontinentalexchange.com under the links "Investors & Media — Governance — Governance & Charter Documents — Board of Directors Corporate Governance Guidelines." We will provide a printed copy of the Governance Guidelines to stockholders upon request. 
Board Education 
For new directors, we provide onboarding materials that are helpful in educating the Board member about our business and operations and our policies and charters. We also have one-on-one meetings with the new director and each of our Chief Financial Officer, a member of the legal department and a member of the compliance team to review information in an informal setting where the director can ask questions in a private session. Our new directors typically serve on the Board for up to one year before joining any committees of the Board of Directors. 
We also conduct at least one annual continuing education session with our full Board of Directors. In recent years, we have had experts present to our Board of Directors on various topics and trends, including a detailed review of our Major Incident Response Plan, use of capital, regulatory changes due to changing U.S. presidential administrations and the U.K.'s referendum vote to leave the European Union and cybersecurity. We also conduct internal training for our directors with respect to business lines or products that may be new or different or areas of emphasis within our operations.

In this section, we discuss our executive compensation program as it relates to our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Position 
 Jeffrey C. Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
 Scott A. Hill    Chief Financial Officer 
 Charles A. Vice    Vice Chairman 
 David S. Goone    Chief Strategy Officer 
 Benjamin R. Jackson    President 
[END TABLE]
We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, exchange traded funds, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer end to end data services and solutions to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world across major asset classes. 
Our executive compensation philosophy is to link compensation with individual achievement, company performance, and the creation of stockholder value. This philosophy manifests itself in the following four primary objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, retain and reward executive officers capable of achieving our business objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• offer competitive compensation opportunities that reward individual contribution and company performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of executive officers and stockholders over the long-term; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• pay total compensation that is commensurate with the performance achieved and value created for stockholders.   
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation program offers three distinct direct compensation elements that are consistent with the objectives outlined above: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary: A cash base salary enables us to recruit and retain qualified executives by  providing regular, stable compensation for their service during the year. We offer base salaries that are competitive with our peers and commensurate with the industry, the experience of the executive and the scope of the role.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual bonus: Our cash bonus plan is designed to reward the achievement of our annual  performance targets, which align with our strategic business priorities. These targets are based primarily on objective and quantitative components, but also include qualitative components for measuring both corporate and individual achievement  relative to pre-established objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity compensation: We use multiple equity vehicles, including stock options and PSUs  for our officers, to deliver long-term incentive compensation in a manner that aligns employee interests with the interests of our stockholders, and serves as a retention tool through multi-year vesting schedules.

2018 Direct Compensation 
2018 Target Direct Compensation 
The Compensation Committee, with the help of its independent compensation consultant, reviews the target direct compensation for our NEOs each year. We have historically aimed to set targets for each element of total direct compensation between the median and 75th percentile of the market relative to our peer group, depending upon factors including the NEO's experience in his or her respective position, individual performance and impact on the organization, company performance, retention objectives and internal pay equity considerations. The Compensation Committee considers each NEO's total compensation package when making changes to the individual elements that comprise the NEO's compensation. For example, if the Compensation Committee makes a change to an officer's base salary, the Compensation Committee reviews the change in light of the other elements of compensation, including the annual bonus and equity compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP metric. Please refer to the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in ICE's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 7, 2019 for the equivalent GAAP term and reconciliation to  the GAAP term.

(1)  For each NEO, the Compensation Committee determined that no adjustments would be made in 2018 to base salary or target  annual bonus.  
(2)  For Messrs. Sprecher, Hill, Vice, and Goone the Compensation Committee determined there would be no increase to 2018  target equity compensation from 2017 target levels. For Mr. Jackson, the Compensation Committee increased his equity target in connection with his promotion to President from the 2017 target level of $1,500,000.  
[END TABLE]
Annual Bonus 
Our NEOs participate in our stockholder approved Executive Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are earned between 0% and 200% of target based on performance measures established at the beginning of each year. Any potential payments are limited according to the terms of the Executive Bonus Plan. Furthermore, the impact of mid-year merger and acquisition activity is excluded from results and cannot be used to meet quantitative financial performance targets established at the beginning of the year. 
At the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee and, as it relates to financial and strategic metrics, the Board of Directors approves company and individual goals for the year. From these goals, management business objectives ("MBOs"), are established that serve as the performance measures for the annual bonus. At the end of each year, the Compensation Committee evaluates the Executive Bonus Plan funding (which is equal to 3% of EBITDA) and awards annual bonus payments to the NEOs based on company and individual achievement of the pre-established MBOs. The Compensation Committee also determines the overall bonus pool available for our broad-based employee annual bonus plan, based on the same MBO achievement criteria. 
2019 Proxy Statement  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  21
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
MBOs for our executive officers, including our NEOs, are made up of financial measures (90%) and non-financial measures (10%). For purposes of 2018 annual bonuses, the financial measures consisted of revenue performance (weighted 30% of the total annual bonus) and adjusted net income performance (weighted 60% of the total annual bonus). The Compensation Committee and management believe that revenue is the right measure for annual performance given our focus on growth. Adjusted net income, which is weighted more heavily, was chosen as it is tied to our overall profitability. The non-financial performance measures included items such as product launches, integration of acquisitions, key technology initiatives, and leadership development. Determining achievement of the non-financial measures necessarily involves a subjective assessment of corporate and individual performance by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee believes that it is appropriate to use some subjective assessments (within the context of the objective EBITDA-based funding formula and maximum bonus amounts) as part of the annual bonus determination in light of ICE's growth, its rapidly evolving industry, the existence of few direct peer companies and the challenges inherent in establishing objective and strictly budget-based goals in a dynamic environment. 
The Compensation Committee strives to set the performance targets for the annual bonus plan at levels that are challenging but achievable, and incorporates a significant degree of "stretch" to encourage and reward outstanding corporate performance. The payouts are leveraged to provide higher payments in years of exceptional performance and lower payments in years where performance is below the target level. For 2018, our target goals for revenue and adjusted net income represented an approximately 5% and 7% increase, respectively, over 2017 actual results, which the Compensation Committee believes were properly challenging given the economic and competitive conditions facing ICE. 
In December 2018 and February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed ICE's performance and determined that the 2018 financial performance MBOs were achieved as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial Metric    2018 Goal    2018 Actual*    2018 Actual Compared to 2018 Goal 
 Consolidated Revenues (weighted 30%)    $4,874 Million    $4,979 Million    102% 
 Adj. Consolidated Net Income Attributable to ICE (weighted  60%)    $1,997 Million    $2,077 Million    104% 
*  The 2018 actual adjusted consolidated net income attributable to ICE is equal to the adjusted consolidated net income  attributable to ICE included in ICE's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on February 7, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
The above weighted financial performance achievement yields an achievement of approximately 103% of the 2018 financial performance MBOs, which accounts for 90% of the overall annual bonus determination. 
In determining achievement of the 2018 non-financial performance MBOs, the Compensation Committee considered the following individual contributions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Sprecher: leadership on continued development of data services business; leadership at NYSE, including the  transition of the senior leadership team; strategic foresight and market leadership; significant work with global regulators, lawmakers and investors; leadership on cryptocurrency matters, including the formation of Bakkt; and his assessment of, and  leadership on, human capital management.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Based on these factors and accomplishments, the Compensation Committee determined that the NEOs achieved their 2018 non-financial performance MBOs, which accounts for 10% of the overall annual bonus determination, at target (100%). Upon evaluating both the financial and non-financial performance, the Compensation Committee determined the final overall 2018 annual bonus achievement to be 102% of target. 
Based on the performance and considerations described above, the following annual bonus awards for fiscal year 2018 were approved by the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name and Position     2018 Annual Bonus

[END TABLE]
All annual bonus awards for the NEOs were paid in cash during February 2019, and are included in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
As noted above, the Compensation Committee seeks to set annual bonus performance targets at levels that incorporate a significant degree of "stretch". Based on our history of achievement under the annual bonus plan, we believe that we have succeeded in setting targets that represent stretch but achievable goals. As illustrated by the below chart, we have performed close to the target level in most of the last five years notwithstanding the fact that we experienced a significant amount of growth during the five-year period, which further illustrates the stretch built into each year's target goals.

For purposes of the 2019 Annual Incentive Plan, the Company will utilize the same financial measures and weightings as used in 2018. With regard to specific performance goals for 2019, we note that because the Company does not provide detailed revenue or earnings guidance, the specific 2019 financial goals are not detailed in this filing. We will publish the 2019 targets and the corresponding 2019 achievement in our 2020 Proxy Statement filing. Please refer to our Investor Relations website at www.ir.theice.com for publicly available information related to our financial performance. 
Equity Compensation 
The Compensation Committee believes that equity awards are an effective vehicle to align the interests of executive officers with those of our stockholders, serve as a retention tool through multi-year vesting schedules and discourage employees from taking inappropriate business risks. ICE is sensitive to the concerns of its stockholders regarding the potential dilutive impact of equity awards, and also takes into account the relevant accounting and tax impact of all potential forms of equity awards in designing its grants. 
2019 Proxy Statement  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  23
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
When determining the form in which to deliver equity compensation, the Compensation Committee seeks to maintain a focus on both growth and financial performance. For purposes of the 2018 equity award, the Compensation Committee used the same equity vehicles and mix to deliver equity compensation to our NEO's as in 2017 as follows: 
We chose stock options as a means of linking a portion of the long-term incentive awards for our most senior executives directly to our Company's stock price growth and performance. For the 2018 award, the Compensation Committee determined the options would vest ratably over a period of three years following the grant date. The Compensation Committee believes the use of stock options is appropriate given the Company's continued positioning as a growth company. 
We introduced TSR-based PSUs in 2017 as a means of creating an even greater link between long-term stockholder value creation and executive rewards. Consistent with 2017, TSR-based PSUs were used to deliver 20% of the 2018 targeted long-term incentive awards to NEOs. As illustrated below, the number of shares ultimately earned under these PSUs will vary based on the Company's cumulative TSR performance over the three-year period from 2018 – 2020 relative to that of the S&P 500. The 2018 TSR-based PSU awards will cliff vest in February 2021 upon the Compensation Committee's determination of performance achievement.

 PSUs earned (as% of target)    50%    100%    200% 
[END TABLE]
We chose EBITDA-based PSUs as a means of rewarding senior executives for delivering on important pre-established financial performance goals. The Compensation Committee continues to believe that EBITDA is a very strong indicator of Company performance and stockholder value, and is the most prominent measure evaluated when determining the financial impact of actual and potential acquisitions. The Compensation Committee determined that a one-year performance period was appropriate again in 2018 for this portion of the long-term incentive awards because of the Company's continued growth trajectory due, in part, to our acquisitive nature. The Compensation Committee determined that as a growth company that is continually developing new products and services and entering new markets, the one-year measure provides the Compensation Committee the opportunity to reset targeted EBITDA performance each year to account for the impact and financial expectations of new products, services, markets and acquisitions. Because EBITDA has been utilized as a consistent measure for these types of awards, the Compensation Committee has the opportunity to ensure the year-over-year targets have a sufficient degree of stretch. 
The EBITDA-based PSUs were subject to ICE's 2018 EBITDA performance as well as a stock market condition that could have reduced the number of shares that were earned above target based on ICE's 2018 TSR as compared to the S&P 500 index. The number of shares that could have been earned based on ICE's 2018 EBITDA performance ranged from zero for performance below the threshold performance target, 50% of the target award for performance at the threshold (85% of the EBITDA goal), 100% of the target award for performance at the target and 200% of the target award for performance at the maximum (113% of the EBITDA goal) performance level. EBITDA results excluded the impact of mid-year M&A activity, which could not be used to meet EBITDA performance targets. In the 
24  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
event ICE achieved above-target EBITDA performance, the stock market condition would have reduced the number of shares earned above target by 10 percentage points if ICE's 2018 TSR was below the S&P 500 index's 2018 TSR by 10% or less, or reduced such shares by 20 percentage points if ICE's 2018 TSR was below the S&P 500 index's 2018 TSR by more than 10%. The table below illustrates the number of PSUs earned based on EBITDA performance and the impact of the stock market condition. Earned awards vest in three equal annual installments beginning in February 2019.

At a meeting in early February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that ICE's EBITDA for 2018 was approximately 102% of target, as illustrated below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial Metric    2018 Goal    2018 Actual*    2018 Actual Compared to 2018 Goal 
 Consolidated EBITDA    $3,154 Million    $3,203 Million    101.6% 
*  The 2018 actual consolidated EBITDA is equal to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted  for the non-GAAP measures described in ICE's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on February 7, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the terms of the awards, certain costs attributable to merger and acquisition activity were excluded based on the rationale that ICE does not want to discourage future acquisition attempts when opportunities arise. Because ICE's 2018 EBITDA performance was above target, ICE's 2018 TSR relative to that of the S&P 500 was reviewed to determine whether any downward modification to the award was required in accordance with the terms of the award. ICE's 2018 TSR exceeded the performance of the S&P 500 resulting in full payout of the award as earned based on EBTIDA performance. Accordingly, EBITDA-based PSUs were earned at 112.31% of the target level resulting in each NEO earning 112.31% of EBITDA-based PSUs set forth in the table above. The first tranche (1/3) of shares earned pursuant to 2018 EBITDA-based PSUs vested on February 11, 2019. Subject to continued employment, the second and third tranches of shares earned are scheduled to vest in equal portions in February 2020 and February 2021. We do not pay any dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned PSUs. 
As with the annual bonus, the Compensation Committee seeks to set equity compensation performance goals at levels that incorporate a significant degree of "stretch". Based on our history of achievement with respect to EBITDA-based PSUs, we believe that we have succeeded in setting targets that challenge our NEOs, and reward exceptional performance. As illustrated by the below chart, we have

performed close to the target level in most of the last five years notwithstanding the fact that we experienced a significant amount of growth during the five-year period, which further illustrates the stretch built into each year's target goals.

2019 Equity Award Structure 
In 2019, the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to continue to award equity compensation in the form of EBITDA-based PSUs, TSR-based PSUs and stock options, but shifted the mix in order to align more of the award with a longer performance period. Accordingly, for 2019, equity awards were delivered to our NEOs 30% in the form of three-year TSR-based PSUs (vs. 20% in 2018) and 50% in the form of one-year EBITDA-based PSUs (vs. 60% in 2018), with the remaining 20% of the award delivered in the form of stock options. 
For the 2019 TSR-based PSU award, we used the same performance measure of ICE's three-year TSR relative to that of the S&P 500, and the same threshold, target and maximum criteria, as utilized in 2018. 
With regard to the specific performance goals for purposes of the 2019 EBITDA-based PSU award, we note that because the Company does not provide detailed revenue or earnings guidance, the specific 2019 EBITDA goal is not detailed in this filing. 
Please refer to our Investor Relations website at www.ir.theice.com for publicly available information related to our financial performance. As we have done in this filing with respect to the 2018 award, we will publish the 2019 EBITDA target for our 2019 PSU awards and the corresponding 2019 achievement in our 2020 Proxy Statement filing. 
Other Compensation and Benefits 
Perquisites 
ICE provides medical insurance, life and disability insurance and other benefits to executives that are generally available to other employees. For certain grandfathered U.S. executive officers, including the NEOs, ICE provides an enhanced term life insurance benefit (calculated at five times salary less $100,000) and a supplemental disability insurance benefit that is designed to approximate the total benefit level (60% of eligible compensation) that cannot be provided pursuant to the limits in our group disability plans ($10,000 per month). Our contributions to these benefits programs are included in the 2018 All Other Compensation section of the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Our Compensation Committee has approved a Corporate Aircraft Policy which, among other things, includes the authorization of up to $75,000 of incremental cost per year to ICE for personal use of company-owned or leased aircraft by each of Mr. Sprecher and Mr. Vice. In 2018, Messrs. Sprecher and Vice did not use any of the $75,000 allotted to them under the Corporate Aircraft Policy. However, Mr. Sprecher did have personal use of the aircraft in 2018 and reimbursed the Company for the full value of this usage as permitted by the Corporate Aircraft Policy. The amount reimbursed by Mr. Sprecher equaled the incremental costs to the Company for such flights as computed from data from an independent third-party. The Corporate Aircraft Policy was modified in February 2019 to permit personal use of the aircraft by the remaining named executive officers, as defined in the Company's Annual Proxy Statement, during their employment, in any calendar year in an amount up to $50,000 of incremental cost to the Company. 
There were no other perquisites provided to any of our executive officers in 2018 that would require disclosure in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Retirement Plans 
We provide retirement benefits to U.S. corporate officers through a 401(k) retirement plan on the same terms and conditions as those offered to all ICE employees. Generally, in 2018, we provided an immediately vested matching contribution of 100% of the first 6% of employee 
26  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
deferrals of eligible compensation to all participants in the plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits ($275,000 per individual in 2018). We do not offer an active defined benefit pension plan or any other form of active supplemental executive retirement plan. 
2018 "Say-on-Pay" Vote Result and Stockholder Engagement 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 18, 2018, approximately 96% of stockholders voted to approve the non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition to seeking stockholder feedback through our "say-on-pay" votes, we reached out to stockholders representing about 48% of our outstanding shares and also held meetings with approximately 10 of our largest stockholders to obtain their views on our executive compensation program and governance matters. The Compensation Committee will continue to review our executive compensation program as well as consider stockholder input and consider the outcome of our "say-on-pay" votes when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs. 
Compensation Practices 
We do not maintain formal targets for the allocation of total compensation through each compensation element. We do strive to maintain a low fixed-cost compensation structure (i.e., base salary, benefits and perquisites) and to deliver the majority of value through variable pay elements (i.e., annual bonus and performance-based equity compensation). We have maintained this "pay for performance" orientation since our founding and believe it is an important element of our entrepreneurial culture. 
Based on a review by Compensation Advisory Partners, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, our mix of compensation continues to emphasize variable incentive compensation, rather than fixed compensation, to a greater degree than our peers. This focus on variable incentive compensation is consistent with the Compensation Committee's emphasis on performance-based awards for officers and our compensation philosophy. 
We believe that our mix of cash/non-cash and short-term/long-term incentives provides an appropriate balance between our longer-term business objectives and shorter-term retention and competitive needs. We also believe that providing the majority of our NEOs' compensation in the form of long-term incentive awards, when combined with our clawback policy and stock ownership requirements, each discussed below, has the additional benefit of discouraging employees from taking inappropriate risks. 
Compensation Committee Role 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for designing, administering and implementing our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee is composed of four directors and each of the four directors is a "non-employee director," as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and an "outside director," as defined pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. The Compensation Committee determines the type and level of compensation for executive officers (generally defined as Section 16 officers under the Exchange Act, but the Compensation Committee has historically included all corporate officers under this definition), reviews the performance of the Chief Executive Officer, and oversees the administration of ICE's Executive Bonus Plan, ICE's broad-based employee annual bonus plan and all of ICE's equity compensation plans. The Compensation Committee Charter, which is periodically reviewed and revised by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors, outlines the specific responsibilities of the Compensation Committee. 
Our Annual Review Process 
The Compensation Committee reviews our executive compensation programs and practices each year with the help of its independent compensation consultant, Compensation Advisory Partners. Reviews were completed in both 2017 and 2018 that informed decision making for 2018 compensation levels. Generally, the 2017 review informed decision making regarding target 2018 equity awards granted in January of 2018, and the 2018 review informed decision making regarding 2018 salary adjustments as well as target 2018 annual incentive opportunities. As discussed above, for 2018 the Compensation Committee decided to increase target values for 2018 equity compensation for Mr. Jackson in connection with his promotion to President. No other adjustments to target compensation were made in connection with our 2018 review. The next review will be completed in 2019. 
In setting target direct compensation levels for each NEO, the Compensation Committee reviews an analysis of individual compensation levels prepared by Compensation Advisory Partners that reports compensation paid to the NEO and compares base salary, total cash compensation (base salary plus annual bonus) and total direct compensation (total cash compensation plus equity compensation) against relevant market data, including peer group data. 
For Mr. Sprecher, our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee determines individual performance and conducts an annual review of his salary, bonuses and equity awards. For other NEOs, Mr. Sprecher provides input to the Compensation Committee regarding his views on the performance of these other officers during the Compensation Committee's annual review of salary, bonuses and equity awards. 
2019 Proxy Statement  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  27
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
In addition to examining market data on individual positions, the Compensation Committee also focuses on the "total cost of management," which is an aggregation of total direct annual compensation for the NEOs, excluding any special one-time awards. Based on the analysis prepared in 2018 by Compensation Advisory Partners, our "total cost of management" is between median and the 75th percentile of the peer group. Our revenue and EBITDA performance was in the top quartile relative to our peer group over a three-year period which demonstrates our alignment of executive compensation with long-term company performance. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Compensation Advisory Partners, which has served the Compensation Committee since 2011, to advise on executive compensation matters. The information provided by Compensation Advisory Partners in 2018 included: competitive salary, bonus and equity data for certain positions within ICE and benchmarking analysis against our peers. In addition, Compensation Advisory Partners helped analyze our bonus and equity award programs, provided advice regarding the selection of our peer group, provided updates to the Compensation Committee on trends and regulatory developments, analyzed director compensation and assisted in the review of our compensation plans to determine if the arrangements incented inappropriate risk taking. 
The NEOs have not participated in the selection of Compensation Advisory Partners or any other compensation consultant in connection with advice regarding executive and director compensation matters. A representative from the compensation consultant attends most Compensation Committee meetings and is available between meetings as a resource for the Compensation Committee and management. The Compensation Committee determines in its sole discretion which compensation consultant to retain for various services, and the consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee. Use of a particular consulting firm by the Compensation Committee does not preclude management from hiring the same consulting firm. In 2018, Compensation Advisory Partners did not provide any other services to ICE. In compliance with the SEC and NYSE requirements regarding the independence of compensation consultants, Compensation Advisory Partners provided the Compensation Committee with a letter addressing each of the six independence factors. Their responses affirm the independence of the firm and its partners, consultants, and employees who service the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters and governance issues.  
Compensation Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee utilizes a peer group to assess ICE's executive compensation program. ICE's peer group includes comparable financial exchanges, financial services providers, technology companies and related companies based on metrics such as revenue and market capitalization. The peer group is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, with assistance and recommendations from its independent compensation consultant, and adjustments are made as necessary. The Compensation Committee reviews annually the executive pay practices of these peer companies as reported in industry surveys, public filings and reports from compensation consulting firms. This information is considered when making recommendations for ICE's compensation programs and practices. 
The 2018 peer group was the same as the 2017 peer group, comprised of the following companies:

Risk Assessment with Respect to Compensation 
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant and management, has completed a review of compensation policies and programs, including those not applicable to NEOs, and does not believe there are circumstances where the risks arising from these policies or programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ICE. The review examined the balance of fixed and variable elements of compensation, mix of cash and non-cash components and focus on both annual 
28  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
and longer-term operational and financial performance alignment with stockholder interests. Moreover, we designed into our compensation program certain structural features that align our NEOs' financial incentives with those of our stockholders and mitigate inappropriate risk-taking by our executives, including our NEOs, such as a clawback policy, stock ownership requirements, and a total compensation mix weighted in favor of long-term, equity-based awards. The Compensation Committee continues to monitor the risk exposure of our compensation policies and programs. 
Clawback Policy 
We have adopted a compensation recoupment, or "clawback" policy, to permit ICE to seek recovery of performance-based incentive awards in the event of certain financial statement restatements. The clawback policy states: 
Effective December 9, 2010, it is ICE's policy that if ICE's financial statements are required to be restated due to intentional misconduct and/or fraud, the Compensation Committee will, when deemed appropriate in its discretion, direct that ICE seek to recover all or a portion of any affected award made to officers who have engaged in the intentional misconduct and/or fraud that caused the need for the restatement with respect to any fiscal period of ICE. An "affected award" includes any cash or equity-based bonus or incentive compensation payment awarded or given to the employee after the effective date of this policy, and the net proceeds of any stock options exercised after the effective date of this policy, that were advantaged by the filing of the financial statements that were required to be restated. 
The amount to be recovered from such individual shall be the estimated amount up to which the affected award exceeded the amount that would have been paid to (or received by) the employee had ICE's financial statements been properly stated. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine an appropriate recovery amount, if any, under the circumstances, and whether to initiate or continue pursuing a recovery, based upon factors consistent with the Compensation Committee's exercise of its fiduciary duties and the Compensation Committee's good faith reliance upon information, opinions or advice from professional advisors, consultants or experts. 
When the clawback provision under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is finalized and adopted, we will update our policy, as necessary. 
Termination of Employment and Change of Control Payments 
We have entered into employment agreements with each of our NEOs that provide benefits upon certain employment terminations, including certain terminations in connection with a "Change in Control" of ICE. The terms of these employment agreements are discussed in more detail below under the heading "Employment Agreements and Other Factors Affecting 2018 Compensation". The Compensation Committee believes that employment agreements with termination and certain Change in Control protections are appropriate and necessary to attract and retain executive level talent and to mitigate uncertainty and distraction of our management team in the event that the employment of any of our NEOs terminates. The Compensation Committee intends that the terms of NEO employment agreements be consistent with market practice, as adjusted for our business considerations, and periodically reviews the terms of our NEOs' employment agreements compared to market practice. The employment agreements with our NEOs do not include any Code Section 280G "golden parachute" excise tax gross-up provisions. 
The Change in Control protections for NEOs require a "double-trigger" before a payment is provided, meaning that in the context of a Change in Control of the Company, the executive officer's employment must be involuntarily terminated before any severance is paid. The Compensation Committee opted for "double-trigger" arrangements, rather than providing for payments solely on the basis of a Change in Control, because the Compensation Committee believes this to be more consistent with the purpose of encouraging the continued employment of our NEOs following a Change in Control and with market practice. Furthermore, the Change in Control provisions provide significant retention value with respect to our NEOs. 
Stock Ownership Policy, Retention Recommendations and Global Personal Trading Policy 
Stock Ownership Policy 
The Compensation Committee believes that it is in the best interests of stockholders for ICE's executives and directors to own a significant amount of ICE Common Stock because a meaningful direct ownership stake by our executives and directors demonstrates to our other investors and stockholders a strong alignment of interests and commitment to ICE's success, and also provides a structural mechanism to discourage our executives from taking inappropriate business risks. Accordingly, ICE's Stock Ownership Policy is applicable to all ICE officers (including all of the NEOs, but excluding officers for whom a significant portion of their compensation is commission-based or

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
who work in a jurisdiction where ICE does not typically grant equity awards) and directors, and requires the following level of ownership (expressed as a multiple of base salary for executives and a multiple of annual cash retainer for directors): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position    Ownership Multiple Policy Requirement    Average Stock Ownership Multiple* 
 Chief Executive Officer    10 times base salary    451 times (Sprecher) 
 Executive Vice Chairman & President    4 times base salary    32 times (Vice/Jackson) 
 C-Level Executives and Senior Vice Presidents    2 times base salary    52 times (Hill/Goone) 
 Vice Presidents and any other corporate officers    1 times base salary    All in compliance 
 Members of the Board of Directors of ICE    5 times annual cash retainer    All in compliance 
*  As defined in the Stock Ownership Policy and summarized below as of the record date. New officers and directors have five  and three years, respectively, to comply with ownership requirements.  
[END TABLE]
In establishing the ownership multiple, the Compensation Committee considered information about ownership multiples at its peer companies and recommendations from third-party groups such as Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS, and its external compensation consultant. "Ownership," for purposes of this Stock Ownership Policy, includes: (i) shares of ICE Common Stock that are owned outright (including those held by a spouse or dependent children), (ii) vested "in-the-money" stock options and (iii) unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units that are not subject to any performance-based vesting metric. All unvested stock options, "underwater" stock options and unearned performance-based equity awards (including EBITDA-based PSUs and TSR-based PSUs) do not count towards the ownership targets. A newly appointed corporate officer, or newly elected director, will have five years from his or her date of hire or appointment as an officer or director to comply with this Stock Ownership Policy. The Compensation Committee will monitor the ownership levels of such executives and directors during this transition period. 
The Compensation Committee monitors the stock ownership levels of our officers and directors on at least an annual basis. In the event of a corporate officer or director's noncompliance with ICE's stock ownership policy, the Compensation Committee will review the facts and circumstances regarding the noncompliance and will use its discretion in determining the appropriate corrective actions and/or penalties. Such corrective actions and penalties include, but are not limited to, instructing the officer or director to buy shares of our Common Stock in the open market to comply with the Stock Ownership Policy, reducing or eliminating future equity grants to the officer or director until they comply with the Stock Ownership Policy or issuing a warning to the officer or director. To date, there have been no instances of noncompliance with the Stock Ownership Policy. 
Retention Recommendations 
To facilitate meeting the minimum holding requirements as specified in this Stock Ownership Policy in a timely fashion, the Compensation Committee recommends that all corporate officers and directors retain a minimum of 50% of the net value of shares obtained pursuant to each stock option exercise and the vesting of stock units for all future grants of stock options or restricted stock until such corporate officer or director has satisfied the minimum stock ownership targets for his or her position. 
Global Personal Trading Policy 
Our Global Personal Trading Policy prohibits employees and directors from entering into hedging transactions in our securities, as well as pledging our securities. 
Policy on Deductibility of Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally provides that publicly held companies may not deduct compensation paid to certain of its top executive officers to the extent that such compensation exceeds $1 million per officer in a calendar year. Prior to the federal tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code included an exception to this $1 million limit for compensation that is "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of the Code. Under this exception, performance-based compensation paid under a plan that had been approved by ICE's stockholders could be excluded from the $1 million limit if, among other requirements, the compensation was payable only upon attainment of pre-established, objective performance goals and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors that establishes such goals consists only of "outside directors" (as defined for purposes of Section 162(m)). However, the new tax legislation removed the exception for "performance-based compensation" (unless the compensation qualifies for certain transition relief, the scope of which is currently uncertain) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Therefore, compensation (including "performance-based compensation") paid to covered executive officers in excess of $1 million in calendar year 2018 and subsequent calendar years generally will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief. The Compensation Committee continues to consider the tax consequences when determining named executive officer compensation, including in light of changes to Section 162(m), and sets executive compensation in accordance with our compensation philosophies. The Compensation Committee 
30  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
believes that retaining and motivating our employees with a competitive compensation program that is aligned with our strategic business objectives is in the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly retains discretion to award compensation that exceeds deductibility limitations if it deems appropriate in the circumstances. 
To effect this policy, we delivered 2018 performance-based compensation to our NEOs through two incentive plans (the 2017 Omnibus Employee Incentive Plan and the Executive Bonus Plan, which were approved by stockholders in 2017 and 2009, respectively) designed to be compliant with Section 162(m)'s requirements for deductibility in order to preserve ICE's ability to provide compensation that is "performance-based" within the meaning of the Code and therefore preserve ICE's ability to maximize the deductibility of executive compensation.

2018 Nonqualified Defined Contribution and Other Deferred Compensation Plans 
We do not maintain any nonqualified defined contribution plans or active nonqualified deferred compensation plans, such as a supplemental executive retirement plan, 401(k) excess plan, or other vehicles to defer the receipt of cash or equity compensation. 
Employment Agreements and Other Factors Affecting 2018 Compensation 
We have entered into employment agreements with each of the NEOs that contain provisions that govern compensation in the event of termination for cause, termination by ICE unrelated to a Change in Control, and termination by ICE after a Change in Control. The material provisions regarding the employment agreements and the provisions governing these termination scenarios are described below. 
Term of Employment 
The employment agreements for the NEOs, other than Mr. Jackson, provide for an initial employment term of three years, which will be automatically extended every six months during the term of each agreement so that the remaining term of the agreement is never more than three years or less than two and a half years, unless either ICE or the executive, prior to the date of extension, give written notice to the other that there will be no extension. The effect of this provision is to ensure that the term remaining under any of these agreements is never more than the initial term and never less than six months less than the initial term. The employment agreement for Mr. Jackson provides for an initial employment term of two years. Each day, this term will be automatically extended for one day so that there are always two years remaining in the term at any time. 
2019 Proxy Statement  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  37
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Base and Bonus Compensation 
The employment agreements for the NEOs provide for an initial annual base salary, subject to increase, and an annual bonus that is reasonable in light of his contribution for that year and contributions made by and bonuses paid to ICE's other senior executives for such year. In addition, each of the NEOs is also entitled to receive, from time to time, grants of awards under our equity plans, in each case as determined by the Compensation Committee or by the Board of Directors as a whole. 
Non-competition 
Each of the NEOs agrees under his employment agreement that for the term of his employment agreement or, if less, for the one-year period (or for Mr. Jackson, eighteen month period) which starts on the date that his employment terminates, he will not assume or perform any managerial or supervisory responsibilities and duties that are substantially the same as those that he performs for ICE for any other business entity that engages in operating global commodity and financial products marketplaces for the trading of physical commodities, futures contracts, options contracts, and other derivative instruments, providing risk management tools and clearing services, providing brokerage services, and providing market data relating to these services in which ICE is engaged as of the date of termination of the executive's employment or in which ICE proposes to engage under its business plan as in effect on such date, if any site of any of the offices or equipment of such competitive business is located in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. or Singapore. 
The employment agreements provide that each executive may own 5% or less of the stock of a publicly traded company that engages in such competitive business, so long as they are only passive investors and are not actively involved in such company in any way. 
Non-solicitation 
Each of the NEOs is restricted from soliciting, for the purpose of competing with ICE or its affiliates, any of its customers or customers of its affiliates with whom the executive had contact, knowledge or association (i) at any time during the executive's employment with ICE or its affiliates and (ii) at any time during the twenty-four month period immediately preceding the beginning of the "restricted period." "Restricted period" means, for each NEO other than Mr. Jackson, the term of the executive's employment agreement, including after termination of employment, the remainder of the term of the agreement without regard to the reason for the executive's termination of employment (as such initial term may have been extended under the agreement). For Mr. Jackson, "restricted period" means the eighteen-month period after termination of employment, without regard to the reason for termination of employment. 
Each of the NEOs, other than Mr. Jackson, is restricted from soliciting, for the purpose of competing with ICE or its affiliates, any other officer, employee or independent contractor of ICE or its affiliates with whom the executive had contact, knowledge or association (i) at any time during the executive's employment with ICE or its affiliates and (ii) at any time during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the beginning of the "restricted period," to terminate his employment or business relationship with ICE or its affiliates. Mr. Jackson is restricted from soliciting, for the purpose of competing with ICE or its affiliates, any other officer, employee or independent contractor of ICE or its affiliates with whom he had contact, knowledge or association at any time during his employment with ICE for the term of his agreement and during the "restricted period". 
Confidentiality Provisions 
Each of the NEOs is subject to customary confidentiality provisions during the term of employment and for at least a five year period after termination, and each executive must not use or disclose any of ICE's trade secrets for as long as they remain trade secrets. 
Termination for Cause or Executive Resignation Other than for Good Reason 
For each of the NEOs, if ICE terminates the executive for "Cause," as such term is defined below, if the executive resigns other than for "Good Reason," as such term is defined below, or if the executive's employment terminates as a result of his death or disability, ICE must pay the executive, among other benefits, all accrued but unpaid salary, annual bonus, if any, and unreimbursed expenses. If an executive's employment terminates as a result of his death, any unvested stock options, unvested restricted stock units and unvested performance share units will become immediately vested. 
Termination by ICE Unrelated to a Change in Control 
For each of the NEOs, if there is a termination of employment by ICE without "Cause" or resignation by the executive for "Good Reason" that is unrelated to a "Change in Control," as such term is defined below, ICE must pay a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) the amount of salary the executive would have received over the remainder of the term of employment and (ii) three (3) times (two (2) times in the case of Mr. Jackson) the greater of the average of the last three bonuses and the last bonus paid to the executive prior to termination. In addition, for the each NEO other than Mr. Jackson, any stock options or other equity awards granted (including performance-based awards which were earned but not vested for any performance period that was completed as of the termination of employment) will become exercisable or vest upon the executive's termination. For Mr. Jackson, any stock options or other equity awards granted (including performance-based awards which were earned but not vested for any performance period that was completed as of the termination of employment) that would otherwise vest in the two-year period following termination will become exercisable or vest 
38  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
upon his termination. Performance-based awards for any performance period in progress as of the termination of employment will be earned based on actual performance as determined after completion of the performance period, in accordance with the terms of such grants, and such earned awards will fully vest on such determination date. 
Further, for each NEO other than Mr. Jackson, ICE is required to continue to make available coverage under the employee benefits plans as if the executive remained employed for the "Welfare Benefit Continuation Period", defined as the shorter of two years and the balance of the term of the employment agreement. Mr. Jackson is eligible to receive a lump sum cash payment in respect of his costs for two years' group health coverage under COBRA. 
"Cause," as used in the employment agreements for each of the NEOs, generally means: (i) the employee is convicted of, pleads guilty to or otherwise admits to any felony or act of fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement; (ii) the employee knowingly engages or fails to engage in any act or course of conduct that (a) is reasonably likely to adversely affect ICE's rights or qualification under applicable laws, rules or regulations to serve as an exchange or other form of a marketplace for trading the products defined in the non-competition section or (b) violates the rules of any exchange or market on which ICE effects trades (or at such time is actively contemplating effecting trades) and is reasonably likely to lead to a denial of ICE's right or qualification to effect trades on such exchange or market; (iii) there is any act or omission by the employee involving malfeasance or gross negligence in the performance of his duties and responsibilities or the exercise of his powers to the material detriment of ICE; or (iv) the employee (a) breaches any of the covenants made under his employment agreement or (b) violates any provision of any code of conduct adopted by ICE that applies to him if the consequence to such violation ordinarily would be a termination of his employment. 
"Change in Control," as used in the employment agreements for each of the NEOs, generally means: (i) any person is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of any outstanding ICE securities eligible to vote in an election of directors (subject to certain exceptions, including if such person is the executive, an entity controlled by the executive or group of which the executive is a member); (ii) any dissolution or liquidation of ICE or any sale or disposition of 50% or more of ICE's assets or business; or (iii) the consummation of any reorganization, merger, consolidation or share exchange or similar form of corporate transaction involving ICE, unless (a) the persons who were the beneficial owners of outstanding ICE securities eligible to vote in an election of directors immediately before the consummation of such transaction hold more than 60% of the voting power immediately following the consummation of such transaction, and (b) each such person holds such securities in substantially the same proportion immediately following the consummation of such transaction as each such person had held immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction. 
"Good Reason," as used in the employment agreements for each of the NEOs, generally means: (i) there is a material reduction in the executive's base salary or opportunity to receive any annual bonus and equity grants without the executive's express written consent; (ii) there is a material reduction in the scope, importance or prestige of the executive's duties; (iii) executive is transferred from his primary work site to a site that is more than thirty miles from his then current work site; (iv) after a Change in Control, executive's job title is materially changed or executive is no longer provided the same or substantially equivalent plans, programs and policies; (v) there is a material breach of his employment agreement; (vi) executive receives notice of non-renewal during the three years following a Change in Control; (vii) the failure of any successor to ICE to expressly assume executive's employment agreement; or (viii) in the case of Mr. Sprecher, ICE fails to nominate Mr. Sprecher for re-election to the Board of Directors. 
Termination Following a Change in Control 
For each of the NEOs, if the termination of employment by ICE without "Cause" or resignation by the executive for "Good Reason" occurs following, or within 180 days prior to, the effective date of a Change in Control of ICE, ICE must pay the executive a lump sum amount of cash equal to three (3) times (two (2) times in the case of Mr. Jackson) (i) the executive's salary and (ii) the greater of the average of the last three bonuses paid to executive prior to termination, the last bonus paid to executive prior to the effective date of a Change in Control and the last bonus paid to executive prior to termination. In addition, any stock options or other equity awards granted (including performance-based awards which were earned but not vested for any performance period that was completed as of the termination of employment) will become exercisable or vest upon the executive's termination. Performance-based awards for any performance period in progress as of the termination of employment will be earned based on actual performance as determined after completion of the performance period, in accordance with the terms of such grants, and such earned awards will fully vest on such determination date. The executive will be entitled to exercise his stock options that had been granted after entering into the employment agreement for the same period as if the executive had continued in employment through the remainder of his term. 
Further, for each NEO other than Mr. Jackson, ICE must continue to make available coverage under the employee benefits plans as if the executive remained employed for the Welfare Benefit Continuation Period. Mr. Jackson is eligible to receive a lump sum cash payment in respect of his costs for two years' group health coverage under COBRA. 
No officers, including the NEOs, are eligible for any "golden parachute" excise tax or other tax gross-up payments.

(1)  These amounts represent the cash severance payments in accordance with employment agreements as in effect as of  December 31, 2018 (as discussed in the preceding narrative) under the termination scenarios as described in the table. These calculations assume all earned base salary and annual incentive payments have been paid. For a termination unrelated to  a Change in Control, the duration of the remaining employment term has been assumed to equal three years for each NEO, other than Mr. Jackson. For Mr. Jackson, the remaining term has been assumed to be two years. Also, in light of the  assumed termination date of December 31, 2018, the fiscal year 2017 bonus that was paid in February 2018 is the last bonus paid for purposes of the severance calculation under the employment agreements.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
Mr. Tese, Mr. Crisp, Mr. Hatfield, and The Lord Hague of Richmond served as members of our Compensation Committee during 2018. None of our executive officers or directors serves (or, during any time in 2018, served) as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. 
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Directors who are also ICE employees do not receive additional compensation for serving as directors. For 2018, non-employee director compensation consisted of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual retainer of $100,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual retainer of $15,000 for committee members of the Audit Committee, and $10,000 for committee members of the  Compensation Committee, Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual retainer for committee chairpersons (in lieu of the committee member retainers described above) of: $30,000 for  the Audit Committee, $20,000 for the Compensation Committee, Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lead independent director fee of $50,000; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A grant of $175,000 in the form of restricted stock units that vest one year from the date of grant (with the number of  units calculated at the time of grant by dividing the annual grant value by the closing price per share on the grant date).  
[END TABLE]
Directors do not receive fees for individual Board of Directors or committee meetings in addition to the annual retainers referenced above. 
As with our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee utilizes the services of an independent compensation consultant to benchmark the competitiveness of our director compensation program, including compensation offered for service on subsidiary boards. During 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed a director compensation benchmarking report from Compensation Advisory Partners that analyzed each aspect of director compensation against the same peer companies that were utilized for the executive compensation benchmarking report. Based on the results of this report and consultation with its compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee concluded the director compensation program detailed above was appropriate and made no changes to the program in 2018. 
In addition to serving on the parent company Board of Directors, many of our directors also serve as directors on the boards of our subsidiaries and some subsidiary boards pay additional compensation for such board service. In 2018, nine of our current non-employee directors served as members of the boards of directors of our regulated subsidiaries: ICE Futures Europe, ICE Clear Europe Limited, ICE Clear Credit, LLC, ICE Futures U.S., Inc., ICE Clear U.S., Inc., ICE Trade Vault, LLC, ICE Swap Trade, LLC, ICE NGX Canada Inc., ICE Mortgage Services, LLC, New York Stock Exchange, LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE AMEX Options LLC and NYSE National, Inc. 
Given the significant level of responsibility, regulatory oversight of subsidiary activities, and director time commitment to serve on subsidiary boards, we provide compensation to non-employee directors for their service on these subsidiary boards (as illustrated in the below table). Each of these subsidiary boards meets independently and holds four or more meetings a year, plus subsidiary committee meetings. Accordingly, with the assistance of Compensation Advisory Partners, we have structured subsidiary compensation to include elements similar to parent board compensation (i.e., board retainer and committee retainers). We also provide office space for certain of our directors that serve as chairperson of the board of directors of an operating subsidiary.

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
In 2017, we received stockholder approval for, and we implemented, an amendment to our 2013 Omnibus Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan to formally institute a maximum annual compensation level of $850,000 per year (including cash and equity-based compensation from parent company board service and subsidiary board service, as may be applicable). As noted in the table below, all of our directors were below this limit in 2018.

PAY RATIO 
Our median employee was identified based on target total cash compensation, measured as base salary plus target annual bonus plus commission, from our employee population as of December 31, 2017. As we are a U.S.-based entity and our Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Sprecher, is paid in U.S. dollars ("USD"), all amounts paid in currency other than USD were converted to USD prior to identification of the median employee. Mr. Sprecher had 2018 annual total compensation of $14,513,403, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above. Our identified median employee's annual total compensation for 2018, as calculated using the same methodology, was $138,412. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Sprecher's 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 105 times that of our median employee.

AUDIT MATTERS 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, systems of internal controls, qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors, financial reporting processes and such other functions as the Board may assign from time to time. The Audit Committee spent substantial time on matters involving tax regulation changes and the Company's treasury activity. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, which includes the fee negotiation, and oversight of the external auditor. The Audit Committee periodically assesses the work performed by Ernst & Young LLP to ensure a high quality of work is provided to us and, in 2015, considered the pros and cons of switching our external auditor. The Audit Committee also works with our management team in selecting the lead partner on our account and met with the current lead partner before he was put in that role. Our current lead partner has been in that position for us since 2018 and will be subject to mandatory rotation in 2023. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted an Audit Committee Charter, which sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on our website at www.intercontinentalexchange.com under the links "Investors & Media—Governance—Governance & Charter Documents—Charter of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors." The Audit Committee held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Committee has also discussed with our independent public registered accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") AU Section No. 380, as currently in effect. 
The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by Rule 3526 of the PCAOB (Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence) and has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence. The Audit Committee reviewed the audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and determined to engage Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of ICE for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Audit Committee meets to review and approve the financial information in each of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K. During these meetings, the Audit Committee reviews any accounting, tax and treasury issues and events that arose during the quarter, reviews legal matters that may impact our financial statements, reviews our earnings press release, meets with representatives of our internal audit department to discuss Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley") matters and the status of internal audits and discusses the audit or review process conducted by Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee also is responsible for the appointment and replacement, if necessary, of the Chief Audit Executive and consults with management regarding the performance of the Chief Audit Executive. The Audit Committee makes the final determination of the annual compensation of the Chief Audit Executive based on recommendations from the Compensation Committee and senior management. 
Based upon the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements and the discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

PROPOSAL 3 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, in accordance with its charter and authority delegated to it by the Board of Directors, has appointed the firm of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and the Board of Directors has directed that such appointment be submitted to our stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. Ernst & Young LLP has audited our financial statements since 2002 and is considered by our Audit Committee to be well qualified. Our organizational documents do not require that our stockholders ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. We are seeking stockholder ratification because we believe doing so is good corporate practice and our Audit Committee believes appointing Ernst & Young LLP to be in the best interest of our stockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment, but may still retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They also will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Related Party Transactions Approval Policy 
Our Board of Directors has delegated to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee the authority to review and approve all transactions between us and one or more of our directors, or between us and any corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of our directors or officers serve as a director or officer or have a financial interest. In addition, our Global Code of Business Conduct, which applies to all employees, officers and directors, generally prohibits conflicts of interests and requires that such conflicts in all cases should be discussed with management (or the Chief Executive Officer, in the case of conflicts related to outside employment or board membership). The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee reports the findings of any review and its determinations regarding transactions with related persons to the full Board of Directors. 
Our Board of Directors has also adopted a formal, written related-party transactions approval policy that provides that the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee or the Board of Directors will review and approve transactions in excess of $120,000 in value in which we participate and in which a director, executive officer or 5% stockholder (or immediate family member of any of the foregoing) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Under this policy, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable, will be provided with the significant details of each related-party transaction, including the material terms of the transaction and the benefits to ICE and to the relevant related party, as well as any other information it believes to be relevant to review and approve these transactions. In determining whether to approve a related-party transaction, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable, will consider, among other factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms of the transaction are fair to ICE;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether there are business reasons for ICE to enter into the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would impair the independence of a non-employee director;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction presents an impermissible conflict of interest, taking into account the size of the transaction, the  financial position of the director, officer or related party, the nature of his or her interest in the transaction, and the ongoing nature of the transaction.  
[END TABLE]

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
After consideration of the relevant information, the Board of Directors may approve only those related-party transactions that it determines are not inconsistent with the best interests of ICE. This policy also includes categorical standards providing that specified types of transactions will be deemed not to be inconsistent with the best interests of ICE. 
Relationships with Our Stockholders 
Registration Rights 
As a part of the transactions surrounding our formation, we entered into an agreement with our predecessor company, CPEX, on May 11, 2000. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sprecher, owns all the equity interests in CPEX. Pursuant to the agreement, CPEX conveyed all of its assets and liabilities to us. These assets included intellectual property that we used to develop our electronic platform. In return, we issued to CPEX an equity interest in our business and we agreed to give CPEX a put option, by which CPEX could require us to buy its equity interest in our business at the purchase price equal to the greater of our fair market value or $5 million. In connection with our initial public offering, in October 2005 we entered an agreement with CPEX and Mr. Sprecher to terminate the put option upon the closing of our initial public offering. In connection with the termination of the put option, we amended certain registration rights previously granted to CPEX, which as of March 19, 2019 owns [3,791,705] shares of our Common Stock. Under this agreement, CPEX is entitled to require us to register for resale into the public market its Common Stock if Mr. Sprecher's employment with us has been terminated. In addition, we may be obligated to pay the expenses of registration of such shares, including underwriters' discounts up to a maximum of $4.5  million. 
Employment of a Family Member 
Kelly L. Loeffler, Chief Executive Officer of BAKKT Holdings, LLC, a majority owned subsidiary of ICE, received an equity award pursuant to the terms of the BAKKT Equity Incentive Plan on February 28, 2019. BAKKT was formed to develop and operate the cryptocurrency industry's first institutional grade regulated exchange, which will provide clearing and warehousing services for physical delivery and storage. Ms. Loeffler has been married to Jeffrey C. Sprecher, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2004. Since joining ICE in September 2002, Ms. Loeffler reported directly to our Chief Financial Officer and was our Chief Communications and Marketing Officer before accepting the position at BAKKT. Ms. Loeffler continues to report to our Chief Financial Officer in her current position at BAKKT. 
The BAKKT equity award represents an indirect interest in a limited liability company membership interest in BAKKT and does not constitute equity in Intercontinental Exchange. The award consisted of preferred incentive units and represent a right to share preferentially, based on a graduated schedule, in any appreciation of BAKKT above the per unit common membership interest initial price paid by ICE and minority investors. The preferred incentive units only vest based on the achievement of the following qualifying liquidity or change-in-control events: (i) an initial public offering of BAKKT (1/3 will vest at the IPO with time-based vesting of the remaining incentive units commencing following the public offering) or (ii) graduated vesting upon the valuation established at the time of a sale of BAKKT or certain of its membership interests at valuations of between two times BAKKT's initial valuation and four times BAKKT's initial valuation, with 1/3 vesting at two times BAKKT's initial valuation increasing on a straight line basis until 100% vested at a valuation of four times BAKKT's initial valuation. Using a valuation performed by an outside advisor for purposes of establishing annual accounting expense entries, which factored a number of uncertain assumptions, including the assumption that vesting occurs in full at the end of 2027, the total grant date present value of this award was approximately $15.6 million. This valuation, and the resulting annual accounting expense, is subject to review each year based on actual events. 
In 2018, Ms. Loeffler received total cash compensation of approximately $1,010,000 for her service at ICE and BAKKT.

SECTION 16(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and regulations of the SEC require our directors, officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, as well as certain affiliates of such persons, to file initial reports of their ownership of our equity securities and subsequent reports of changes in such ownership with the SEC. Directors, officers and persons owning more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such reports provided by the reporting persons or their respective brokers and on information known to us regarding changes in ownership, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our directors, officers and owners of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities complied with all applicable filing requirements.

What are the voting and ownership limitations? 
Our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation places certain ownership and voting limits on the holders of our Common Stock. Capitalized terms used below and not otherwise defined in this Proxy Statement are defined in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement. Under our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no Person (either alone or together with its Related Persons) may beneficially own shares of our Common Stock representing  in the aggregate more than 20% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter; and  
[END TABLE]
50  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no Person (either alone or together with its Related Persons) shall be entitled to vote or cause the voting of shares of our  Common Stock representing in the aggregate more than 10% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter, and no Person (either alone or together with its Related Persons) may acquire the ability to vote more than 10% of the total  number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter by virtue of agreements entered into by other persons not to vote shares of our outstanding capital stock.  
[END TABLE]
In the event that a Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, beneficially owns shares of our Common Stock representing more than 20% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter, such Person and its Related Persons shall be obligated to sell promptly, and ICE shall be obligated to purchase promptly, at a price equal to the par value of such shares of Common Stock and to the extent that funds are legally available for such purchase, that number of shares of our Common Stock necessary so that such Person, together with its Related Persons, shall beneficially own shares of our Common Stock representing in the aggregate no more than 20% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter, after taking into account that such repurchased shares shall become treasury shares and shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding. 
In the event that a Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, possesses more than 10% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter (including if it possesses this voting power by virtue of agreements entered into by other Persons not to vote shares of our outstanding capital stock), then such Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, will not be entitled to vote or cause the voting of these shares of our capital stock to the extent that such shares represent in the aggregate more than 10% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast on any matter, and ICE shall disregard any such votes purported to be cast in excess of this percentage. 
The voting limitations do not apply to a solicitation of a revocable proxy by or on behalf of ICE or by any officer or director of ICE acting on behalf of ICE or to a solicitation of a revocable proxy by an ICE stockholder in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act. This exception, however, does not apply to certain solicitations by a stockholder pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b)(2) under the Exchange Act, which permits a solicitation made otherwise than on behalf of ICE where the total number of persons solicited is not more than ten. 
Our Board of Directors may waive the provisions regarding ownership and voting limits by a resolution expressly permitting this ownership or voting (which resolution must be filed with and approved by the SEC prior to being effective), subject to a determination of our Board of Directors that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition of such shares and the exercise of such voting rights, as applicable, by such Person, either alone or  together with its Related Persons, will not impair:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability of any national securities exchange registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act that is directly or  indirectly controlled by the Company (each such national securities exchange so controlled, an "Exchange"), Intermediate Holding Company or the Company to discharge their responsibilities under the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations thereunder; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability of the SEC to enforce the Exchange Act;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition of such shares and the exercise of such voting rights, as applicable, is otherwise in the best interests of  ICE, its stockholders and each Exchange;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• neither the Person obtaining the waiver nor any of its Related Persons is subject to any statutory disqualification (as  defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act) if such Person is seeking to obtain a waiver above the 20% level; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for so long as ICE directly or indirectly controls one or more Exchanges, neither the Person requesting the waiver nor any  of its Related Persons is a Member of any Exchange.  
[END TABLE]
In making these determinations, our Board of Directors may impose conditions and restrictions on the relevant stockholder or its Related Persons that it deems necessary, appropriate or desirable in furtherance of the objectives of the Exchange Act and the governance of ICE. 
Our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also provides that our Board of Directors has the right to require any Person and its Related Persons that our Board reasonably believes to be subject to the voting or ownership restrictions summarized above, and any stockholder (including Related Persons) that at any time beneficially owns 5% or more of our outstanding capital stock, to provide to us, upon our Board's request, complete information as to all shares of our capital stock that such stockholder beneficially owns, as well as any other information relating to the applicability to such stockholder of the voting and ownership requirements outlined above. 
If you are a Related Person with another holder of our Common Stock and either: (i) you (either alone or with your Related Person) may vote shares of Common Stock representing more than 10% of the then outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, or (ii) you have entered into an agreement not to vote shares of our Common Stock, the effect of which agreement would be to enable any Person, either alone or with its Related Persons, to vote or cause the voting of shares of our Common Stock that represent in the aggregate more than 10% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting, then please so notify ICE by contacting our Corporate Secretary by mail at Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., 5660 New Northside Drive, Third Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, or by phone at 770-857-4700.

VOTING INSTRUCTIONS AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
How can I view the stockholders list? 
A list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for inspection upon request of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting at our principal executive offices, 5660 New Northside Drive, Third Floor, Atlanta, GA 30328, during the ten days prior to the Annual Meeting, during ordinary business hours, and at the Annual Meeting. To make arrangements to review the list prior to the Annual Meeting, stockholders should contact our Investor Relations department at (770) 857-4700 or investors@theice.com. 
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials? 
Pursuant to the SEC "Notice and Access" rules, we are furnishing our proxy materials to our stockholders over the Internet instead of mailing each of our stockholders paper copies of those materials. As a result, we will send our stockholders by mail or e-mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to as the Notice, containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet and how to vote. The Notice is not a ballot or proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares of Common Stock. You will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the Notice or on the website referred to on the Notice. 
If you own shares of Common Stock in more than one account — for example, in a joint account with your spouse and in your individual brokerage account — you may have received more than one Notice. To vote all of your shares of Common Stock, please follow each of the separate proxy voting instructions that you received for your shares of Common Stock held in each of your different accounts. 
We expect to send the Notice to most of our stockholders by mail or email beginning on or about March 19, 2019. 
What information does the Notice contain? 
The Notice includes, among other matters: (i) the place, date and time of the Annual Meeting; (ii) a brief description of the proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting and the Board of Directors' voting recommendation with regard to each proposal; (iii) information regarding the website where the proxy materials are posted; (iv) various methods by which a stockholder may request paper or electronic copies of the proxy materials; and (v) instructions on how to vote by Internet, by telephone, by mail or in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If I have previously indicated that I want to get ICE proxy materials electronically, will I get them electronically this year? 
Yes. If you previously elected to receive proxy materials electronically, this year you will receive the Notice and you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials. If you have previously agreed to electronic delivery of our proxy materials but wish to receive paper copies of the materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting or for future meetings, please follow the instructions on the Notice you received to request paper copies. 
How do I vote? 
You may submit your proxy with voting instructions in one of three ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet. Go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions for Internet voting, which can  also be found on the enclosed proxy card. You will be required to provide your assigned control number located on the proxy card. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day. If you choose to vote by Internet, then you do not need to return the  proxy card. To be valid, your vote by Internet must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on May 16, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

You will be required to provide your assigned control number located on the proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day. If you choose  to vote by telephone, then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your vote by telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on May 16, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials to be sent to you by mail, complete the proxy  card, sign and date it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided. To be valid, your vote by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on May 16, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
You may also vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. See What do I need to do to attend the Annual Meeting? below. 
If your shares of Common Stock are held in "street name" (i.e., through a bank, broker or other nominee), your proxy materials include a voting instruction form from the institution holding your shares. The availability of telephone or Internet voting will depend upon the institution's voting processes. Please contact the institution holding your shares of Common Stock for more information. 
52  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  2019 Proxy Statement 
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
What do I need to do to attend the Annual Meeting and can I view the Annual Meeting without physically attending the Annual Meeting? 
You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person by ballot. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person you will need to bring proof of your ownership of Common Stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2019. 
If you hold shares of Common Stock in "street name" and would like to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to bring an account statement or other acceptable evidence of ownership of Common Stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2019. Alternatively, you may contact the institution in whose name your shares are registered and obtain a legal proxy from that institution and bring it to the Annual Meeting. 
We plan to broadcast the Annual Meeting live over the Internet. You can access the Annual Meeting through our Investor Relations website at www.ir.theice.com under the link "Events & Presentations." You can also listen to the Annual Meeting live via telephone by dialing 800-919-0370 from the United States or Canada, or 212-231-2931 from outside the United States. 
How can I revoke my proxy or substitute a new proxy or change my vote? 
You may revoke a proxy at any time before it is exercised by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• filing a written revocation with the Corporate Secretary of ICE;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a proxy bearing a later date (by Internet, telephone or mail) that is received no later than the deadline  specified on the proxy card; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Please note, however, that under the rules of the NYSE, any beneficial owner of our Common Stock whose shares are held in street name by a NYSE member brokerage firm may revoke its proxy and vote its shares in person at the Annual Meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures as employed by such beneficial owner's brokerage firm. 
Attending the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke a proxy that was submitted by Internet, telephone or mail. 
If I submit a proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, how will my shares be voted? 
If you properly submit your proxy by one of these methods, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. 
If you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not give voting instructions, your shares will be voted as follows: FOR the election of ICE's director nominees; FOR the advisory resolution on executive compensation; FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and otherwise voted in accordance with the judgment of the persons voting the proxy on any other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting. 
If I hold my shares in "street name" through a broker and do not provide voting instructions, can my broker still vote my shares? 
Under the rules of the NYSE, brokers that have not received voting instructions from their customers ten (10) days prior to the meeting date may vote their customers' shares in the brokers' discretion on the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm because this matter is currently deemed as a "routine" matter under NYSE rules. In addition, certain member brokers will only vote uninstructed shares in the same proportion as the instructions received by that broker from all other stockholders. 
NYSE rules provide that (i) the election of directors and (ii) the advisory resolution on our executive compensation are "non-routine" matters, which means that member brokers that have not received instructions from the beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock do not have discretion to vote the shares held by those beneficial owners on the election of directors and the advisory resolution on our executive compensation. 
How many votes are required to transact business at the Annual Meeting? 
A majority of all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum (i.e., the minimum number of shares that must be present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting in order to transact business). Any 
2019 Proxy Statement  INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE  53
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
shares in excess of the voting limits described in What are the voting and ownership limitations? will not count as present or outstanding for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting unless the holder of those shares has received a waiver of the voting limits from our Board of Directors. Subject to the rules regarding the votes necessary to adopt the proposals discussed below, abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. "Abstentions" occur when stockholders are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting but fail to vote or voluntarily withhold their vote for any of the matters upon which the stockholders are voting. "Broker non-votes" are proxies returned by brokerage firms for which no voting instructions have been received from beneficial owners. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the Annual Meeting, it will be deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting (including any meeting resulting from any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting, unless a new record date is set). 
How are votes counted? 
Election of Directors 
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for a majority vote standard in the election of directors in uncontested elections. This means that a majority of the votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote "for" or "against" the election of a director nominee must be voted "for" the director nominee in order for that director nominee to be elected. A director who fails to receive a majority of "for" votes will be required to tender his or her resignation. An abstention will not be treated as a vote "for" or "against" the election of any nominee and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Advisory Resolution on Our Executive Compensation 
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to approve the advisory resolution on our executive compensation. An "abstention" from voting on this matter will be treated as "present" for quorum purposes. However, since an abstention is not treated as a vote "for" or "against" the matter, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2019 
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. An "abstention" from voting on this matter will be treated as "present" for quorum purposes. However, since an abstention is not treated as a vote "for" or "against" the matter, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
In the cases of the (i) election of directors, (ii) advisory resolution on our executive compensation and (iii) approval of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, only votes cast "for" or "against" will be considered; abstentions and broker non-votes will not be treated as a vote "for" or "against" any of these proposals and therefore will have no effect on the vote. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker on how to vote on the approval of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP within a specified period of time prior to the meeting, then your broker will have the authority to vote your shares on such proposal. 
Where and when will the voting results be available? 
We will file the official voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If the official results are not available at that time, we will provide preliminary voting results in the Form 8-K and will provide the final results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as soon as they become available. 
Who pays for the expenses of this proxy solicitation? 
In addition to soliciting proxies through the mail and by email pursuant to the SEC "Notice and Access" rules, we may solicit proxies through our directors, officers and employees in person and by telephone or facsimile. We have also engaged Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, CT 06902 to assist us in the solicitation of proxies, and the anticipated cost of such engagement is approximately $10,000.00. Brokerage firms, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries also may be requested to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by them. We will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies.
