QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
Q:    Why did I receive this proxy statement?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You received this proxy statement because you were a member of the Company at the close of business on December 20, 2018, the record date, and are entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
Q:    When and where is the 2019 Annual Meeting?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The 2019 Annual Meeting will be held at the Randolph County Fair Grounds, 1885 US-27, Winchester, Indiana on Tuesday, February 19, 2019.  Registration for the meeting will begin at 5:00 p.m. EST.  The 2019 Annual Meeting will commence at approximately 6:00 p.m. EST.                                   
[END TABLE]
Q:    What am I voting on?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The Board of Directors is soliciting the proxies of members who are not "Appointing Members" pursuant to Section 5.3(c) of our Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, as amended, (the "operating agreement") to vote on the election of two directors.  Any member who is entitled to appoint a director pursuant to section 5.3(c) of our operating agreement is not entitled to vote for the election of any other directors.  If you are not an "Appointing Member", you are entitled to vote for the election of two directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors is soliciting the proxies of all members to provide an advisory vote on the approval of the Company's executive compensation called a "Say-on-Pay" vote.
Q:    How many votes do I have?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: On any matter which may properly come before the meeting, each member entitled to vote will have one vote for each membership unit owned of record by such member as of the close of business on December 20, 2018.  Pursuant to Section 6.15 of the operating agreement, members do not have any dissenters' rights.                                     
Q: What is the voting requirement to elect directors and what is the effect of a withheld vote or an abstention? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In the election of directors, the two persons receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected regardless of whether any individual nominee receives votes from a majority of the quorum.  Members do not have cumulative voting rights.  In the director election, because directors are elected by plurality vote, withheld/abstention votes will not be counted either FOR or AGAINST any nominee.  Withheld/abstention votes will be included when counting units to determine whether a sufficient number of the voting membership units are represented to establish a quorum.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the Say-on-Pay vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The Say-on-Pay vote is a vote by the Company's members whereby the member can either endorse or not endorse the Company's system of compensating its executive officers.  While the Say-on-Pay vote is not binding on the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors intends to take the vote into consideration in making future compensation awards to the Company's executive officers.  The Company may also use the Say-on-Pay vote to engage members in a dialogue regarding the Company's system of compensating its executive officers.                     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the voting requirement for the Say-on-Pay vote and what is the effect of an abstention?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The advisory vote on executive compensation called the Say-on-Pay vote will be approved if the votes cast FOR the proposal exceed the votes cast AGAINST the proposal. A properly executed proxy card marked ABSTAIN with respect to the proposal will not be voted and will not count FOR or AGAINST the proposal.  Abstentions with respect to this proposal will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the effect of a broker non-vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: While we do not believe that any of our units are held in street name by brokers, broker non-votes, if any, will count for purposes of establishing a quorum at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  A broker non-vote occurs when an individual owns units which are held in the name of a broker.  The individual is the beneficial owner of the units, however, on the records of the Company, the broker owns the units. If the individual who beneficially owns the units does not provide the broker with voting instructions on non-routine matters, including the proposals presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, this is considered a broker non-vote.  For such non-routine matters, the broker cannot vote either way and reports the units as "non-votes." These broker non-votes function as abstentions. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    How many membership units are outstanding?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: At the close of business on December 20, 2018, there were 11,724 outstanding membership units held by non-Appointing Members, meaning that there can be a total of 11,724 votes on the election of directors.  At the close of business on December 20, 2018, there were 14,606 outstanding membership units.  As such there can be a total of 14,606 votes on the Say-on-Pay advisory vote.   
[END TABLE]
Q:    How do I vote?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Membership units can be voted only if the holder of record is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting either in person or by proxy.  You may vote using any of the following methods: 
[END TABLE]
• Proxy Card.  The proxy card is a means by which a member may authorize the voting of his, her, or its membership units at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  The membership units represented by each properly executed proxy card will be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting in accordance with the member's directions.  The Company urges you to specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on your proxy card.  After you have marked your choices, please sign and date the proxy card, mail it to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC at 1554 N. County Road 600 E., Union City, Indiana 47390, or fax it to the Company at (765) 964-3349.  In order for your vote to count, the Company must receive your proxy card by 5:00 p.m. EST on Monday, February 18, 2019.  If you sign and return the proxy card without specifying any choices, your membership units will be voted FOR the incumbents, Thomas Chalfant and J. Phillip Zicht and FOR the Say-on-Pay proposal.  
• In person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Members of record as of December 20, 2018 may vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
If membership units are owned jointly by more than one person, both persons must sign the proxy card in order for the units to be counted.   Q:    What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my units?
A:    You may revoke your proxy by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting; 
• Giving written notice of the revocation, which is received by Robert Davis, chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, at the Company's offices at 1554 N. County Road 600 E., Union City, IN 47390 by 5:00 p.m. EST by Monday, February 18, 2019; or 
• Giving written notice of the revocation to Robert Davis at the commencement of the 2019 Annual Meeting.     
[END TABLE]
Q:    What happens if I mark too few or too many boxes on the proxy card?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If you do not mark any choices for directors on the proxy card, then the Proxies will vote your units FOR the incumbents Thomas Chalfant and J. Phillip Zicht.  If you mark fewer than two choices for directors, the Proxies will vote your units ONLY for the person you mark as your choice. If you do not mark any choices for the Say-on-Pay advisory vote, then the Proxies will vote your units FOR Say-on-Pay.  If you mark contradicting choices on the proxy card, such as both FOR and WITHHOLD/ABSTAIN for a nominee or FOR and AGAINST a proposal, your votes will not be counted with respect to the director nominee or the proposal for which you marked contradicting choices.   
[END TABLE]
However, each fully executed proxy card will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  If you do not submit a proxy card or attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, your units will not be counted as present at the 2019 Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
Q:    Who can attend the 2019 Annual Meeting?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: All members as of the close of business on December 20, 2018, the record date, may attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    What is the record date for the 2019 Annual Meeting?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: December 20, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    Who will count the votes?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the 2019 Annual Meeting which will be our chief financial officer, William Dartt.  Mr. Dartt will be assisted by an administrative employee of the Company.  The inspector of election will separately tabulate votes and abstentions. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What constitutes a quorum? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The presence in person or by proxy of members holding 25% of the issued and outstanding membership units entitled to vote on the matter is required to constitute a quorum.  On December 20, 2018, the Company had 14,606 issued and outstanding membership units.   
[END TABLE]
Of the 14,606 issued and outstanding membership units only 11,724 units may be voted in the election of directors or counted towards a quorum at the 2019 Annual Meeting because 2,882 units are held by "Appointing Members" who have appointed directors pursuant to Section 5.3(c) of our operating agreement and who are unable to vote on the election of directors.  As a result, the presence in person or by proxy of 2,931 membership units will constitute a quorum for purposes of the election of directors.  If you are entitled to vote on the election of directors and submit a proxy or appear at the meeting, then you will be considered part of the quorum.
The presence in person or by proxy of 3,652 membership units will constitute a quorum for purposes of the Say-on-Pay advisory vote.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The entire cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by the Company.  The cost will include the cost of supplying necessary additional copies of the solicitation material for beneficial owners of units held of record by brokers, dealers, banks and voting trustees and their nominees and, upon request, the reasonable expenses of such record holders for completing the mailing of such material and report to such beneficial owners. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I nominate a candidate for election as a director for the 2020 annual meeting and what is the deadline for submitting my nomination? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The Company plans to hold elections of directors at next year's annual meeting.  Nominations for director positions are made by a nominating committee appointed by the Board of Directors.  In addition, a member may nominate a candidate for director by following the procedures explained in Section 5.3(b) of the operating agreement.  Section 5.3(b) of the operating agreement requires that written notice of a member's intent to nominate an individual for director must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the secretary of the Company not less than 120 calendar days prior to the one year anniversary of the date the Company's proxy statement was released in connection with the previous year's annual meeting.  Director nominations for the 2020 annual meeting must be submitted to the Company by August 22, 2019.               
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is a member proposal? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: A member proposal is your recommendation or requirement that the Company and/or the Board of Directors take action, which you intend to present at a meeting of the Company's members.  Your proposal should state as clearly as possible the course of action that you believe the Company should follow.  If your proposal is placed in the Company's proxy statement, then the Company must also provide the means for members to vote on the matter via the proxy card. The deadlines and procedures for submitting member proposals are explained in the following question and answer.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: When are member proposals due for the 2020 annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In order to be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, member proposals must be submitted in writing to the Company by August 22, 2019.  The Company suggests that proposals for the 2020 annual meeting of the members be submitted by certified mail-return receipt requested.   
[END TABLE]
Members who intend to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of members without including such proposal in the Company's proxy statement must provide the Company notice of such proposal no later than November 22, 2019.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.  
If the Company does not receive notice of a member proposal intended to be submitted to the 2020 annual meeting by November 22, 2019, the persons named on the proxy card accompanying the notice of meeting may vote on any such proposal in their discretion, provided the Company has included in its proxy statement an explanation of its intention with respect to voting on the proposal.

PROPOSAL TWO
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 (SAY-ON-PAY)
We believe that our compensation policies and procedures are reasonable based on the size and complexity of the Company and are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our members.  Publicly reporting companies are required to present their members the opportunity to provide an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation program.  We urge you to read the "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION" section of this proxy statement, including the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, for details on the Company's executive compensation, including the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives and the compensation of our executive officers for our 2018 fiscal year.  This advisory member vote, commonly known as "Say-on-Pay," gives you as a member the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive officer compensation program and policies through the following resolution:  
"RESOLVED, that the members endorse the compensation of the Company's executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the related disclosure contained under the caption "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION" of  the Company's 2019 proxy statement."
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Board of Directors will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.  We believe the "Say-on-Pay" proposal demonstrates our commitment to achieving a high level of total return for our members. 
We currently anticipate that we will present the "Say-on-Pay" proposal to our members every year and anticipate that the next "Say-on-Pay" vote will occur at our 2020 annual meeting.  We also currently intend to ask our members every six years whether the "Say-on-Pay" vote should occur every one, two or three years.  The next advisory vote as to frequency of the "Say-on-Pay" will occur at our 2023 Annual Meeting.  
Required Vote and Board Recommendation
This proposal will be approved if the votes cast FOR the proposal exceed the votes cast AGAINST the proposal, regardless of whether either alternative receives a vote from a majority of the membership units represented at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR ENDORSEMENT OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  FOR EACH PROPERLY EXECUTED PROXY WHERE THE MEMBER DOES NOT MARK ANY CHOICES, THE PROXIES WILL VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL TWO.

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  To our knowledge, and based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations from our officers and directors, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were complied with during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' MEETINGS AND INDEPENDENCE
The Board of Directors generally meets once per month.  The Board of Directors held fourteen regularly scheduled and special meetings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  Each of the directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for the period each served on the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors does not have a formal process for holders of units to send communications to the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors feels this is reasonable given the accessibility of our directors.  Members desiring to communicate with the Board of Directors may do so by contacting a director via our website, fax, phone or in writing.  The names of our directors are listed on our website at http://www.cardinalethanol.com.
The Board of Directors does not have a policy with regard to directors' attendance at annual meetings.    The Company's 2018 Annual Meeting was attended by eleven of the directors.  Due to this high attendance record, it is the view of the Board of Directors that such a policy is unnecessary.
Director, Former Director and Nominee Independence
The determination of independence is made by reference to NASDAQ rule 5605(a)(2).   All of our directors and former directors are independent with the exception of Thomas Chalfant and J. Phillip Zicht.  Mr. Chalfant is not independent because a company owned by his sons delivered grain to the Company in excess of $200,000 in at least one of the last three fiscal years.  Mr. Zicht is not independent because he personally delivered grain to the Company in an amount in excess of $120,000 in at least one of the last three fiscal years.  In evaluating the independence of our directors and nominees, we considered the following factors:  (i) the business relationships of our directors; (ii) positions our directors hold with other companies; (iii) family relationships between our directors and other individuals involved with the Company; (iv) transactions between our directors and the Company; and (v) compensation arrangements between our directors and the Company.  
Board Leadership Structure and Role In Risk Oversight
The Company is managed by a chief executive officer that is separate from the chairman of the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors has determined that its leadership structure is effective to create checks and balances between the executive officers of the Company and the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing all material risks that face the Company, including risks related to changes in commodity prices.  The Board of Directors administers its oversight functions by reviewing the operations of the Company, by overseeing the executive officers' management of the Company, and through its risk management committee.  
Code of Ethics
The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics that sets forth standards regarding matters such as honest and ethical conduct, compliance with the law, and full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications.  The Code of Ethics applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.  A copy of the Code of Ethics is available on the Company's website at www.cardinalethanol.com.  AUDIT COMMITTEE
Audit Committee
The Company has a standing audit committee established in accordance with section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act.  The purpose of the audit committee is to monitor the integrity of the Company's financial reporting process and systems of internal controls.  The audit committee appoints and monitors the independence and qualifications of the Company's independent auditors, monitors the performance of the Company's internal audit function, provides an avenue of communication among the independent auditors, management, and the Board of Directors, and prepares an audit committee report to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement.
The audit committee of the Board of Directors operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors.  A copy of the audit committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.cardinalethanol.com.  Under the charter, the audit committee must have at least three members.  The Board of Directors appointed Robert Baker, Thomas Chalfant, Thomas Chronister, Robert Davis, Dale Schwieterman and Steven Snider to the audit committee.   The chair of the nominating committee is Dale Schwieterman. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Schwieterman and Mr. Baker will serve as the audit committee's financial experts as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K based on their expertise in accounting and finances.  
The audit committee is exempt from independence listing standards because our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  Nevertheless, Thomas Chronister, Robert Davis, Dale Schwieterman and Steven Snider are independent within the definition of independence provided by NASDAQ rules 5605(a)(2) and (c)(2).  Mr. Chalfant would not be considered independent under the NASDAQ rules because a company owned by his sons delivered grain to the Company in excess of $200,000 in at least one of the last three fiscal years.  Robert Baker would not be considered independent under the NASDAQ rules in that he is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the outstanding units.  However, the Board of Directors believes including Mr. Chalfant and Mr. Baker on the audit committee is reasonable due to the fact that the delivery of grain was in the ordinary course of business of the Company and a majority of the audit committee members are independent.  A director would not be independent if they, or a family member, had been employed by the Company at any time during the last three years, accepted any compensation from the Company in excess of $120,000 during the last three years, was a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of any organization which had extensive business dealings with the Company or was an affiliate of the Company.  
Audit issues were specifically addressed by the audit committee during the four audit committee meetings that were held during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  Each of our audit committee members attended at least 75% of the audit committee meetings for the period served on the committee with the exception of Steven Snider.  
Audit Committee Report
The following report of the audit committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any previous or future documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the reference in any such document.
The audit committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors.   Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process.  The Company's independent accountants are  responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles.  The committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  The committee has discussed with Boulay PLLP, its independent accountants, the matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committee (AS16).  The committee has received from the independent auditors written disclosures regarding the auditors' independence required by PCAOB and the Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and has discussed with the independent auditors, the independent auditors' independence.  The committee has considered whether the provision of services by Boulay PLLP not related to the audit of the financial statements referred to above and to the reviews of the interim financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q are compatible with maintaining Boulay PLLP  independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in the annual report on Form 10-K accompanying this proxy statement for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

NOMINATING COMMITTEE
The nominating committee of the Board of Directors operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors.  A copy of the charter is available on the Company's website at www.cardinalethanol.com.  Under the charter, the nominating committee must have at least three members.  Robert Davis, Thomas Chalfant, and Thomas Chronister served as the nominating committee for our 2018 fiscal year.  The chair of the nominating committee is Robert Davis.  The nominating committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  Each of our nominating committee members attended at least 75% of the nominating committee meetings.      
Based upon the size of the Company and the Board of Director's familiarity with the Company since inception, the Board of Directors also has determined that each of the directors is qualified to suggest nominees for consideration to the nominating committee.  The major responsibilities of the nominating committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Develop a nomination process for candidates to the Board of Directors; 
• Establish criteria and qualifications for membership to the Board of Directors;  
• Identify and evaluate potential director nominees; 
• Present to the Board candidates to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors; and 
• Recommend nominees to the Board of Directors for election or re-election. 
[END TABLE]
The following list represents the types of criteria the nominating committee takes into account when identifying and evaluating potential nominees:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Agricultural, business and financial background; 
• Accounting experience; 
• Community or civic involvement; 
• Independence from the Company (i.e. free from any family, material business or professional relationship with the Company); 
• Lack of potential conflicts of interest with the Company; 
• Examples or references that demonstrate a candidate's integrity, good judgment, commitment and willingness to consider matters with objectivity and impartiality; and 
• Specific needs of the existing Board of Directors relative to any particular candidate so that the overall Board composition reflects a mix of talents, experience, expertise and perspectives appropriate to the Company's circumstances. 
[END TABLE]
The nominating committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  Nevertheless, Thomas Chronister and Robert Davis are considered independent within the definition of independence provided by NASDAQ rule 5605(a)(2).  Thomas Chalfant would not be considered independent under the NASDAQ rule because a company owned by his sons delivered grain to the Company in excess of $200,000 in at least one of the last three fiscal years. 
The nominating committee does not have a policy with regard to the consideration of diversity when identifying nominees for director.  The nominating committee may consider nominations for director positions from the Company's members.  
The nominating committee chose to nominate Thomas Chalfant and J. Phillip Zicht for election to a three-year term at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Both are incumbent Directors. 
In addition,  the operating agreement provides a procedure for the members to nominate individuals to stand for election as directors. Nominations for the election of directors may be made by any member entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.  In accordance with the Company's operating agreement, a member desiring to nominate one or more persons for election as a director for the 2019 Annual Meeting must submit written notice of such intent either by personal delivery or regular mail to the Secretary of the Company at least 120 days prior to the one year anniversary of the date of delivery of this proxy statement.  This notice must contain:  (i) the name and address of record of the member who intends to make the nomination; (ii) a representation that the member is the holder of units of the Company entitled to vote at the annual meeting and intends to appear personally or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation or employment of each nominee; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the member and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the member; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such member as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; (vi) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected; and (vii) a nominating petition signed and dated by the holders of at least five percent of the then outstanding units and clearly setting forth the proposed nominee as a candidate of the director's seat to be filled at the next election of directors. The Company received no nominations from the members for the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we entered into transactions with a related party.  Our director, J. Phillip Zicht, delivered grain to to the Company in the approximate amount of $166,383.  Our Board of Directors reviews all transactions with related parties, as that term is defined by Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K, or any transaction in which related persons have an indirect interest.  The Company's operating agreement includes a written policy that requires that certain related transactions be made on terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the Company than if the transaction had been made with an independent third party.  Further, our operating agreement requires directors to disclose any potential financial interest in any transaction being considered by the Board of Directors.  The above transaction was reviewed by the Board of Directors and the Company believes that the transaction was made on terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the Company than if the transaction had been made with an independent third party.  
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
Throughout this proxy statement, the individuals who served as our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, commodity manager and plant manager are referred to as the "executive officers".  
Compensation Committee
The Board of Directors appointed Ralph Brumbaugh, Cyril LeFevre, Steven Snider and J. Phillip Zicht to serve as the compensation committee for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  Ralph Brumbaugh is the chair of the compensation committee.  The compensation committee of the Board of Directors operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors.  A copy of the compensation charter is available on the Company's website at www.cardinalethanol.com.  Under the charter, the compensation committee must have at least three and no more than five members.   The compensation committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  Each of our compensation committee members attended at least 75% of the compensation committee meetings during the period served.  The compensation committee has direct responsibility with respect to the compensation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer and oversees the compensation of our other executive officers. The compensation committee has the overall responsibility for approving and evaluating our director and executive compensation plans, policies and programs.      
The compensation committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  Nevertheless, Ralph Brumbaugh, Cyril LeFevre and Steven Snider are independent within the definition of independence provided by NASDAQ rule 5605(a)(2).  J. Phillip Zicht would not be considered independent under the NASDAQ definition in that he personally delivered grain to the Company in an amount in excess of $120,000 in at least one of the last three fiscal years.
In setting compensation, the executive compensation committee took into account the member vote at our 2018 annual meeting, called the "Say-on-Pay," where the Company's members overwhelming voted to endorse the Company's system of compensating its executive officers.  The next "Say-on-Pay" vote will be conducted at the 2020 annual meeting.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
The compensation committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for establishing, implementing and regularly monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives.  The compensation committee ensures that the total compensation paid to the executive officers is fair, reasonable and competitive.  Generally the types of compensation and benefits provided to the executive officers are similar in form to the compensation and benefits provided to our other employees.            
The compensation committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• establishes and administers a compensation policy for senior management; 
• reviews and approves the compensation policy for all of our employees other than senior management; 
• reviews and monitors our financial performance as it affects our compensation policies or the administration of those policies; 
• reviews and monitors our succession plans; 
• approves awards to employees pursuant to our incentive compensation plans; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approves modifications in the employee benefit plans with respect to the benefits salaried employees receive under such plans. 
[END TABLE]
Our compensation programs are designed to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and talented executives who will contribute to the Company's success by reason of their ability, ingenuity and industry; 
• Link compensation realized to the achievement of the Company's short and long-term financial and strategic goals; 
• Align management and member interests by encouraging long-term member value creation; 
• Maximize the financial efficiency of the compensation program from tax, accounting, cash flow and dilution perspectives; and 
• Support important corporate governance principles and comply with best practices. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee Procedures
All of the committee's actions are reported to the Board of Directors and, where appropriate, submitted to the Board of Directors for ratification.  In determining the chief executive officer's compensation, the committee considers evaluations prepared by the directors.  From time to time, the compensation committee may delegate to the chief executive officer the authority to implement certain decisions of the committee, to set compensation for lower executive officers, including the Company's chief financial officer, plant manager, commodity manager, production manager, EHS manager, and controller or to fulfill administrative duties.
The compensation committee receives input from the chief executive officer on the personal performance achievements of the executives and management employees who report to him.  This individual performance assessment determines a portion of the annual compensation for each executive.  In addition, the chief executive officer provides input on salary increases, incentive compensation opportunities, and long-term incentive grants for the executives and management employees who report to him, which the committee considers when making executive compensation decisions.  
The compensation committee does its own performance review of the chief executive officer, and discusses the performance review with the Board of Directors.  The compensation committee annually evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer in light of the goals and objectives of the Company's executive compensation plans, and determines and approves, or recommends to the Board of Directorsfor its approval, the chief executive officer's compensation level based on this evaluation.  In determining the long-term incentive component of the chief executive officer's compensation, the compensation committee will consider all relevant factors, including the Company's performance, the value of similar awards to chief executive officers of comparable companies, and the awards given to the chief executive officer of the Company in past years.  The chief executive officer is not present at either compensation committee or board level deliberations concerning his compensation.
Base Salary
Base salaries for our executive officers are established based on the scope of their roles, responsibilities, experience levels and performance, and taking into account competitive market compensation paid by comparable companies for similar positions.  Base salaries are reviewed approximately annually, and may be adjusted from time to time to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual performance and experience.
Bonus Plan    
Our Board of Directors approved an Amended and Restated Employee Bonus Plan for our 2018 fiscal year ("2018 Bonus Plan") which took effect beginning October 1, 2017.  The purpose of the 2018 Bonus Plan is to reward employees for their contributions that directly impact financial results, reflect a positive safety culture and to promote teamwork.  The 2018 Bonus Plan consisted of both financial goals and team goals.  All employees, including our executive officers, can earn an annual bonus up to 10% of the employees' gross wages if the Company meets certain minimum net income financial goals by September 30, 2018.  Employees can earn 5% if the Company has net income of at least $7,500,000, 7.5% if the Company has net income of at least $12,000,000 and 10% if the Company reaches a minimum threshold of $20,000,000 net income.  All employees, including our executive officers, can earn an additional quarterly bonus of up to 10% of the employees' gross wages if team goals are met which are based on certain operational statistics, benchmarking results and individual safety participation.  The 2018 Bonus Plan also provides additional incentives to the management team which include our executive officers.  Those management employees can earn an additional bonus of up to 10% of their gross wages based on meeting individual goals.   Under the 2018 Bonus Plan, employees, including our executive officers, received a bonus equal to 5% of their gross wages under the financial goals because the Company had net income in excess of $7,500,000 at September 30, 2018.  Employees, including our executive officers, also received quarterly bonuses of 5.90% of their gross wages under the team goals.  Finally, our management team, including our executive officers, earned bonuses of 5.74% of their gross wages under the individual goals.
Our Board of Directors approved an Amended and Restated Employee Bonus Plan for our 2019 fiscal year ("2019 Bonus Plan") which took effect beginning October 1, 2018.  The purpose and terms of the 2019 Bonus Plan are substantially similar to the 2018 Bonus Plan described above.   
No Change of Control or Severance Agreements
Our executive officers do not have change of control or severance agreements, which means the Board of Directors retains discretion over severance arrangements if it decides to terminate their employment.     
Accounting and Tax Treatment of Awards
None of our executive officers, directors, or employees receives compensation in excess of $1,000,000 and therefore the entire amount of their compensation is deductible by the Company as a business expense. Certain large executive compensation awards are not tax deductible by companies making such awards. None of our compensation arrangements are likely to reach this cap in the foreseeable future.
Executive Compensation Committee Report
The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.  Based upon this review and discussion, the compensation committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.
