We also will transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting.  As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other business to be presented for consideration at the annual meeting other than the matters described in this Proxy Statement.
Who is Entitled to Vote?
We have fixed the close of business on March 1, 2019 as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at our annual meeting.  Only holders of record of Banner's common stock on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting.  You are entitled to one vote for each share of Banner common stock you own.  On March 1, 2019, there were 35,078,901 shares of Banner common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.
How Do I Vote at the Annual Meeting?
Proxies are solicited to provide all shareholders on the voting record date an opportunity to vote on matters scheduled for the annual meeting and described in these materials.  This question provides voting instructions for shareholders of record.  You are a shareholder of record if your shares of Banner common stock are held in your name.  If you are a beneficial owner of Banner common stock held by a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), please see the instructions in the following question.
Shares of Banner common stock can only be voted if the shareholder is present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting.  To ensure your representation at the annual meeting, we recommend you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the annual meeting.  You can always change your vote at the meeting if you are a shareholder of record.
Shareholders may vote by proxy via the Internet or a toll-free telephone number, or by mailing a proxy card.  Instructions for voting are found on the proxy card.  Shares of Banner common stock represented by properly executed proxies will be voted by the individuals named on the proxy card in accordance with the shareholder's instructions.  Where properly executed proxies are returned to us with no specific instruction as how to vote at the annual meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares FOR election of each of our director nominees, FOR advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, for holding future advisory votes on executive compensation every ONE YEAR and FOR ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.  If any other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting for action, the persons named in the enclosed proxy and acting thereunder will have the discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.  We do not currently expect that any other matters will be properly presented for action at the annual meeting.
You may receive more than one proxy card depending on how your shares are held.  For example, you may hold some of your shares individually, some jointly with your spouse or other party and some in trust for your children.  In this case, you will receive three separate proxy cards to vote.
What if My Shares Are Held in Street Name?
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker, your broker, as the record holder of the shares, is required to vote the shares in accordance with your instructions.  If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker may nevertheless vote the shares with respect to discretionary items, but will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to non-discretionary items, pursuant to current industry practice.  In the case of non-discretionary items, the shares not voted will be treated as "broker non-votes."  The proposal to elect directors and the advisory votes on executive compensation are considered non-discretionary items; therefore, you must provide instructions to your broker in order to have your shares voted with respect to these proposals.
If your shares are held in street name, you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the annual meeting.  A recent brokerage statement or letter from the record holder of your shares are examples of proof of ownership.  If you want to vote your shares of common stock held in street name in person at the annual meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares.
How Many Shares Must Be Present to Hold the Meeting?
A quorum must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted.  The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of Banner common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting as of the record date will constitute a quorum.  Proxies received but marked as abstentions or broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting.
What if a Quorum Is Not Present at the Meeting?
If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the meeting, a majority of the shareholders present or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is present.  The time and place of the adjourned meeting  will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice will be given unless the meeting is adjourned for 120 days or more.  An adjournment will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the meeting.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 1: Election of Directors
Banner's Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for the election of directors by a majority of the votes cast by shareholders in uncontested elections.  Accordingly, in an uncontested election, the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" the nominee, in order for that nominee to be elected.  The following are not considered votes cast: (1) a share whose ballot is marked as abstain; (2) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (3) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder of record gives no authority or direction.  The term of any director who was a director at the time of the election but who does not receive a majority of votes cast in an election held under the new majority vote standard will continue to serve as a director until terminated on the earliest to occur of: (1) 90 days after the date election results are determined; (2) the date the Board appoints a new director to fill the position; or (3) the date and time the director's resignation is effective.
Banner's Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that an election is considered a contested election if there are shareholder nominees for director pursuant to the advance notice provision and who are not withdrawn by the advance notice deadline set forth in Banner's Articles of Incorporation.  If the Board determines there is a contested election, the election of directors will be held under a plurality standard.  Under the plurality standard, the nominees who receive the highest number of votes for the directorships for which they have been nominated will be elected.
Pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, shareholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors.  Votes may be cast for or against each nominee, or shareholders may abstain from voting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of our director nominees.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 2: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
The advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Shareholder Votes on Executive Compensation
The advisory (non-binding) vote regarding the frequency of future shareholder votes on executive compensation has three alternatives.  Shareholders may vote that shareholder votes on executive compensation be held every year, every two years or every three years, or shareholders may abstain from voting.  The alternative receiving the greatest number of votes โ every year, every two years or every three years โ will be the frequency that shareholders approve.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory vote because the alternative receiving the greatest number of votes will be the frequency that shareholders approve.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote for the adoption of an advisory resolution that shareholders should consider an advisory resolution on executive compensation EVERY YEAR.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 4: Ratification of the Selection of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting.  Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm. May I Revoke My Proxy?
You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข submitting a new proxy with a later date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข notifying Banner's Secretary in writing before the annual meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข voting in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you plan to attend the annual meeting and wish to vote in person, we will give you a ballot at the annual meeting.  However, if your shares are held in "street name," you must bring a validly executed proxy from the nominee indicating that you have the right to vote your shares.
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT  
The following table sets forth, as of March 1, 2019, the voting record date, information regarding share ownership of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข those persons or entities (or groups of affiliated person or entities) known by management to beneficially own more than five percent of Banner's common stock other than directors and executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข each director and director nominee of Banner;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table appearing under "Executive Compensation" below (known as "named executive officers"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข all current directors and executive officers of Banner and Banner Bank as a group.  
[END TABLE]
Persons and groups who beneficially own in excess of five percent of Banner's common stock are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and provide a copy to us, reports disclosing their ownership under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Securities Exchange Act").  To our knowledge, no other person or entity, other than those set forth below, beneficially owned more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Banner's common stock as of the close of business on the voting record date.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of common stock if he or she has voting and/or investment power with respect to those shares.  Therefore, the table below includes shares owned by spouses, other immediate family members in trust, shares held in retirement accounts or funds for the benefit of the named individuals, and other forms of ownership, over which shares the persons named in the table may possess voting and/or investment power.  In addition, in computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to outstanding options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after the voting record date are included in the number of shares beneficially owned by the person and are deemed outstanding for the purpose of calculating the person's percentage ownership.  These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
As of the voting record date, there were 35,153,834 shares of Banner common stock outstanding.  Of these shares, 35,114,642 had voting rights and 39,192 were non-voting shares.  The non-voting shares consist of shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting conditions that were issued to the named executive officers as well as other executive officers.  Recipients of time-based restricted stock receive dividends during the restriction period and have the power to vote unvested stock.  Recipients of performance-based restricted stock are entitled to dividends but only as and when the shares to which the dividends are attributable become vested.  Recipients of performance-based restricted stock do not have voting rights with respect to unvested shares.

  PROPOSAL 1 โ ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  
Our Board of Directors currently consists of 14 members and is divided into three classes.  Directors Robert D. Adams, Gordon E. Budke and Gary Sirmon have all reached Banner's mandatory retirement age and will retire effective as of the annual meeting of shareholders.  In conjunction with the annual meeting, the size of the Board of Directors will be reduced to 11 members.  Approximately one-third of the directors are elected annually to serve for a three-year period or until their respective successors are elected and qualified.
 The table below sets forth information regarding each director of Banner and each nominee for director.  The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors selects nominees for election as directors.  Each of our nominees currently serves as a Banner director, and has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and has agreed to serve if elected.  If a nominee is unable to stand for election, the Board of Directors may either reduce the number of directors to be elected or select a substitute nominee.  If a substitute nominee is selected, the proxy holders will vote your shares for the substitute nominee, unless you have withheld authority.  At this time, we are not aware of any reason why a nominee might be unable to serve if elected.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of Cheryl R. Bishop, Connie R. Collingsworth and Brent A. Orrico, each for a three-year term.

 MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors conducts its business through Board meetings and through its committees.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held nine meetings.  No director attended fewer than 75% of the total meetings of the Board and committees on which such person served during this period.
Committees and Committee Charters
The Board of Directors has standing Executive, Audit, Compensation, Risk and Corporate Governance/Nominating Committees.  The Board has adopted written charters for the Audit, Compensation, Risk and Corporate Governance/ Nominating Committees and although copies of these charters are not available on our website,  the charters, excepting the Risk Committee charter, must be attached to the annual meeting proxy statement at least once every three years or when the charter has been materially amended.  The Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee charters are attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, consisting of Directors Orrico (Chairman), Budke, Collingsworth, Grescovich, Herencia and Sirmon, acts for the Board of Directors when formal Board action is required between regular meetings.  The Committee has the authority to exercise all powers of the full Board of Directors, except that it does not have the power to, among other things, declare dividends, authorize the issuance of stock, amend the Bylaws or approve any agreement of merger or consolidation other than mergers with Banner subsidiaries.  The Executive Committee met once during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, consisting of Directors Budke (Chairman), Adams, Klaue, Layman, Matson and Riordan, oversees management's fulfillment of its financial reporting responsibilities and maintenance of an appropriate internal control system.  It also has the sole authority to appoint or replace our independent registered public accounting firm and oversees the activities of our internal audit functions.  The Audit Committee believes it has fulfilled its responsibilities under its charter.  The Committee met 13 times during the year ended December 31, 2018. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent," in accordance with the requirements for companies quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ").  In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Budke, Mr. Matson and Mr. Riordan meet the definition of "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the SEC.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee, which consists of Directors Herencia (Chairman), Collingsworth, Orrico and Saintil, sets salary policies and levels for executive officers and oversees all of our salary and incentive compensation programs.  The Committee believes it has fulfilled its responsibilities under its charter.  The Compensation Committee met eight times during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Each member of the Compensation Committee is "independent," in accordance with the requirements for companies quoted on NASDAQ.  The Committee meets, outside of the presence of Mr. Grescovich, to discuss his compensation and make its recommendation to the full Board, which then votes on his compensation.  Mr. Grescovich makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation of all other executive officers.  The Committee considers the recommendations of Mr. Grescovich and makes its recommendation to the full Board, which then votes on executive compensation.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee, consisting of Directors Orrico (Chairman), Adams, Bishop, Grescovich, Layman, Matson Saintil and Schwakopf provides oversight of our enterprise-wide risk structure and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor and manage our credit risk, market and liquidity risk, interest rate risk and operating risk, including technology, legal and compliance risk.  The Committee also reviews management's strategies and policies for managing these risks and serves as the primary point of contact between the Board and senior management in assessing enterprise-wide risk management activities and effectiveness.  The Risk Committee met eight times during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee
The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, consisting of Directors Collingsworth (Chair), Herencia, Klaue and Schwakopf, assures that we maintain the highest standards and best practices in all critical areas relating to the management of the business of Banner.  The Committee also selects nominees for the election of directors and develops a list of nominees for board vacancies.  The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee believes it has fulfilled its responsibilities under its charter.  Each member of the Committee is "independent," in accordance with the requirements for companies quoted on NASDAQ.  The Committee met seven times during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Only those nominations made by the Committee or properly presented by shareholders will be voted upon at the annual meeting.  In its deliberations for selecting candidates for nominees as director, the Committee considers the candidate's level of success and respect in the candidate's field, as well as the candidate's independence, communication skills, education, character and community involvement.  The Committee also considers the candidate's knowledge of the banking business and whether the candidate would provide for adequate representation of our market area.  Any nominee for director made by the Committee must be highly qualified with regard to some or all these attributes.  The Committee does not specifically consider diversity in identifying nominees for director; however, the Committee believes that the judicious application of the criteria described above provide Banner with a well-rounded and effective Board with a diverse range of experience and perspectives.
In searching for qualified director candidates to fill vacancies in the Board, the Committee solicits its current Board of Directors for names of potentially qualified candidates.  Additionally, the Committee may request that members of the Board of Directors pursue their own business contacts for the names of potentially qualified candidates.  The Committee would then consider the potential pool of director candidates, select the candidate the Committee believes best meets the then-current needs of the Board, and conduct a thorough investigation of the proposed candidate's background to ensure there is no past history that would cause the candidate not to be qualified to serve as a Banner director.  The Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our shareholders.  If a shareholder submits a proposed nominee, the Committee would consider the proposed nominee, along with any other proposed nominees recommended    by members of the Board of Directors, in the same manner in which the Committee would evaluate its nominees for director.  For a description of the proper procedure for shareholder nominations, see "Shareholder Proposals" in this Proxy Statement.  The Committee has also used executive search and leadership consulting firm, Spencer Stuart, in prior years in its search for qualified nominees, especially with respect to a qualified "financial expert."
Leadership Structure
The positions of Chairman of the Board and of President and Chief Executive Officer are held by two persons.  This has been the case since 1995, when Banner was formed to become the holding company for Banner Bank.  The Board believes this structure is appropriate for Banner because it provides the Board with capable leadership and independence from management.  It also allows the President and Chief Executive Officer to focus on the day-to-day business of managing Banner, while the Chairman leads the Board.
Board Involvement in the Risk Management Process
The Board of Directors recognizes that effective risk management requires a high level of cooperation between the Board and senior management.  Nonetheless, the Board has established and maintains its independence in overseeing the conduct of Banner, including the risk management process.  The Board's leadership structure takes into account its risk administration function by the conduct of its business through Board meetings and through its committees, in particular the Corporate Governance/Nominating, Audit and Risk Committees, as well as by the separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board and of President and Chief Executive Officer as described above.
Directors keep themselves informed of the activities and condition of Banner and of the risk environment in which it operates by regularly attending Board and assigned Committee meetings, and by review of meeting materials, auditor's findings and recommendations, and supervisory communications.  Directors stay abreast of general industry trends and any statutory and regulatory developments pertinent to Banner and the Banks by periodic briefings by senior management, counsel, auditors or other consultants, and by more formal director education.  The Corporate Governance/ Nominating Committee monitors and evaluates director training and information resources.
The Board oversees the conduct of Banner's business and administers the risk management function by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข selecting, evaluating, and retaining competent senior management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข establishing, with senior management, Banner's long- and short-term business objectives, and adopting operating policies to achieve these objectives in a legal and sound manner;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข monitoring operations to ensure that they are controlled adequately and are in compliance with laws and policies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข overseeing Banner's business performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข ensuring that the Banks help to meet our communities' credit needs.  
[END TABLE]
These responsibilities are governed by a complex framework of federal and state law and regulation as well as regulatory guidelines applicable to the operation of Banner and the Banks.
The Board ensures that all significant risk taking activities are covered by written policies that are communicated to appropriate employees.  Specific policies cover material credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputation risks.  The policies are formulated to further Banner's business plan in a manner consistent with safe and sound practices.  The Board ensures that all such policies are monitored by senior management to make certain that they conform with changes in laws and regulations, economic conditions, and Banner's and the Banks' circumstances.  The policies are implemented by senior management who develop and maintain procedures, including a system of internal controls, designed to foster sound practices, to comply with laws and regulations, and to protect Banner against external crimes and internal fraud and abuse. The Board's policies also establish mechanisms for providing the Board with the information needed to monitor Banner's operations.  This includes senior management reports to the Board.  These reports present information in a form meaningful to members of the Board, who recognize that the level of detail and frequency of individual senior management reports will vary with the nature of the risk under consideration and Banner's and the Banks' unique circumstances.
The Board further enhanced its involvement in the risk management process in September 2010 by the establishment of a Risk Committee.  The Risk Committee reviews management's strategies and policies for managing enterprise-wide risks and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor and manage those risks.  The Risk Committee also serves as the primary point of contact between the Board and senior management in assessing enterprise-wide risk management activities and effectiveness.
The Board has also established a mechanism for independent third party review and testing of compliance with policies and procedures, applicable laws and regulations, and the accuracy of information provided by senior management.  This is accomplished, for example, by the Director of Internal Audit reporting directly to the Audit Committee.  In addition, an annual external audit is performed. The Audit Committee reviews the registered public accounting firm's findings with senior management and monitors senior management's efforts to resolve any identified issues and recommendations.  The Audit Committee provides regular reports of its activities to the Board.
The Board also reviews reports of inspection and examination or other supervisory activity, and any other material correspondence received from Banner's regulators.  Findings and recommendations, if any, are carefully reviewed, and progress in addressing such matters is routinely monitored.
Corporate Governance
We are committed to establishing and maintaining high standards of corporate governance.  The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee is responsible for initiatives to comply with the provisions contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder, and NASDAQ rules governing corporate governance.  In January 2018, the Board of Directors adopted comprehensive corporate governance guidelines as a framework to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to shareholders.  A copy of the guidelines is available on our website at www.bannerbank.com.  The guidelines cover a wide range of topics including Board composition, selection, tenure, evaluation and retirement of Board members, Board leadership and director responsibilities.  The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee will continue to evaluate and improve our corporate governance principles and policies as necessary and as required.
The Board of Directors has also adopted a policy governing trading in Banner's securities by our directors and officers.  This wide-ranging policy covers permissible timing of trades, as well as prohibitions on trades.  In particular, the policy prohibits short sales, transactions in publicly-traded options and other types of hedging transactions.  The policy also prohibits holding Banner securities in margin accounts or pledging Banner securities for any purpose, with the exception of pledges in effect before the policy was adopted.
Code of Ethics and Ethics Officer.  Effective July 19, 2018, Banner adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct ("Code of Ethics"), which replaces all similar prior codes, including those adopted in 2003 and 2015.  The Code of Ethics is a comprehensive revision and modernization of prior codes, incorporating corporate governance best practices, and is applicable to directors, officers and employees.  The Code of Ethics covers conflicts of interest, insider trading, regulatory and compliance issues, reporting complaints and concerns, and other ethics-related policies and procedures.  The Code is available on Banner's website at www.bannerbank.com.  On June 26, 2018, Banner established the position of Ethics Officer, responsible for overall administration of Banner's ethics program, and for handling particular ethics and conflicts of interest issues; and appointed General Counsel Craig Miller as Ethics Officer.  Banner utilizes the Ethicspoint website and hotline complaint service, and provides information as to the availability of that service on its website and in its internal communications.
Communications with Shareholders.  The Board of Directors maintains a process for shareholders to communicate with the Board.  Shareholders wishing to communicate with the Board of Directors should send any communication to the Secretary, Banner Corporation, 10 S. First Avenue, Walla Walla, Washington 99362.  Any  communication must state the number of shares beneficially owned by the shareholder making the communication.  The Secretary will forward such communication to the full Board of Directors or to any individual director or directors to whom the communication is directed unless the communication is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly inappropriate, in which case the Secretary has the authority to discard the communication or take appropriate legal action.
Annual Meeting Attendance by Directors.  We do not have a policy regarding Board member attendance at annual meetings of shareholders.  All directors attended last year's annual meeting of shareholders, with the exception of Gary Sirmon.
Related Party Transactions.  We have a number of written policies governing transactions with related parties.  These policies are intended to ensure that all transactions entered into with related parties are in the best interests of Banner and its shareholders.  As a general rule, transactions with directors and officers, and their related interests are prohibited.  An exception applies to normal banking relationships.
Our Code of Ethics provides that where an officer or director finds that any financial or business relationship with customers, consultants, or vendors may impair, or appear to impair, the independence of business judgment on behalf of Banner, that person must (1) disclose fully to a supervisor, the Chief Executive Officer or to the Board of Directors the existence and nature of the conflict and (2) remove and insulate himself/herself from all decision-making and action related to that financial or business activity of Banner.  Each year, our directors and officers complete a conflict of interest questionnaire to ensure that no conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest are overlooked.
The Banks have followed a policy of granting loans to our employees, officers and directors, which fully complies with all applicable federal and state regulations.  All outstanding loans to our directors and executive officers: (1) were made in the ordinary course of business; (2) were made on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Banks; and (3) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features when made.  Loans made to executive officers and directors are granted pursuant to the normal underwriting procedures of the Banks.  Loans made to a director or executive officer in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other loans to that person and his or her related interests, are in excess of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the institution's capital and surplus (up to a maximum of $500,000) must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors.  All lines of credit to insiders that, combined with other loans, do not exceed $500,000 for directors and their related interests or $100,000 for executive officers and that do not fall within the exceptions to Regulation O of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve") must be approved by the Board of Directors at least annually.  All loan approval and review procedures are governed by written policies.
In addition, each director and executive officer completes a form annually to identify all related interests.  Deposit and loan accounts of directors, executive officers and related interests are then coded in our systems so that developments can be tracked.  Our Regulation O officer, a compliance specialist, monitors developments monthly and completes a quarterly report of Regulation O compliance which is submitted to the Board of Directors.
Director Independence.  Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market.  In accordance with NASDAQ rules, at least a majority of our directors must be independent directors.  The Board has determined that 13 of our 14 directors are "independent," as defined by NASDAQ.  Robert D. Adams, Cheryl R. Bishop, Gordon E. Budke, Connie R. Collingsworth, Roberto R. Herencia, David A. Klaue, John R. Layman, David I. Matson, Brent A. Orrico, Kevin F. Riordan, Merline Saintil, Terry Schwakopf and Gary Sirmon are independent.   Former director Michael M. Smith was also independent.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
In October 2015, the Board of Directors adopted a non-employee stock ownership policy requiring non-employee directors to own shares of Banner's common stock equal in value to three times the respective director's annual cash retainer.   Directors are permitted to meet the policy requirements over time and are restricted from divesting shares until the policy requirement is met.  As of December 31, 2018, 10 of 13 non-employee directors exceeded the ownership requirements under the policy.  The three non-employee directors who do not currently meet the ownership requirements are in the process of fulfilling the policy requirements over time. In September 2018, the Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for Banner executives, requiring the Chief Executive Officer to own shares of Banner's common stock equal to three times his annual base salary and other executives to own shares equal to one time their respective base salaries.  As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Grescovich and 7 of the remaining 15 executives exceeded the ownership requirements under the guidelines.

The plan documents and award agreements have been revised to clarify that dividends on restricted stock units can be deferred until settlement of the units and that Banner will not pay dividends on future unvested awards.

(5)  Appointed effective November 1, 2018.  
(6)  Includes $31,800 in fees for attending meetings of the Board of Directors of Islanders Bank.  
(7)  Includes $500 for attending meetings of the Board of Directors of Community Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of Banner  Bank.  
(8)  As a result of changes in the expected life assumption, the present value of Mr. Sirmon's supplemental retirement benefits and salary continuation plan increased by $25,640 in 2018. Had we used the same life expectancy assumption as in the prior year, the value would have decreased by $79,300.  
(9)  Includes $77,062 pursuant to Mr. Sirmon's salary continuation agreement and $57,604 pursuant to his supplemental retirement agreement (each as described below), as well as country club dues and life insurance premiums paid.  
(10)  Retired effective April 24, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
 Non-employee directors of Banner receive an annual cash retainer paid monthly of $40,000, an annual restricted stock or restricted stock unit award of $50,000 and a fee of $1,000 per committee meeting attended.  The Chairman of the Board and various committee chairs receive additional retainers as follows, paid 50% in cash and 50% in restricted stock or restricted stock units: the Chairman of the Board, $40,000; the Chairman of the Audit Committee, $20,000; the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, $12,500; the Chairman of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, $10,000; and the Chairman of the Risk Committee, $10,000.
In order to encourage the retention of qualified directors, we have entered into deferred fee agreements whereby directors may defer all or a portion of their regular fees until retirement.  Each director may direct the investment of the deferred fees toward the purchase of Banner common stock, mutual fund-style investments or a stable value account.  We have established grantor trusts to hold the common stock and mutual fund-style investments.  The assets of the trusts are considered part of our general assets and the directors have the status of unsecured creditors of Banner with respect to the trust assets.  The deferred fee agreements provide pre-retirement death and disability benefits in an amount equal to the value of the director's account balance upon the occurrence of either event.  At retirement, a director, as previously elected, may receive the balance of his or her account in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period not exceeding ten years.  In connection with its acquisitions, Banner also assumed liability for certain deferred compensation plans for the acquired institutions' directors.  At December 31, 2018, our estimated deferred compensation liability accrual with respect to non-employee directors under these agreements was $3.5 million.
Banner Bank entered into an agreement with Mr. Sirmon while he was employed as an executive officer to provide supplemental retirement benefits.  Banner Bank has purchased life insurance to recover the benefits payable under this agreement upon Mr. Sirmon's death.  The agreement provides that, following retirement at or after attaining age 62 and for a minimum of a 180-month period thereafter, Banner Bank will pay Mr. Sirmon (or his beneficiary) an annual benefit based on his level of pre-retirement compensation and other retirement benefits.  Mr. Sirmon's monthly benefit is approximately $4,800 and was first paid on August 1, 2005.
Banner Bank entered into a salary continuation agreement in October 1993 with Mr. Sirmon, a director and former President and Chief Executive Officer of Banner and Banner Bank, to ensure his continued service through retirement.  Banner Bank has purchased life insurance to recover the benefits payable under the agreement upon Mr. Sirmon's death.  Mr. Sirmon retired on July 16, 2005 and will receive monthly payments over a minimum of a 180-month period following retirement.  Mr. Sirmon's monthly benefit is approximately $6,422 and was first paid on August 1, 2005.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Executive Summary
2018 Corporate Highlights.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, Banner reported a net profit available to common shareholders of $136.5 million or $4.15 per diluted share.  Management achieved substantial success on Banner's goals to develop strong earnings momentum as well as to maintain a moderate risk profile.  Highlights of this success for the year included outstanding client acquisition and account growth, significantly increased non-interest-bearing deposit balances and strong loan growth, as well as further improvement in our asset quality coupled with increased reserves, resulting in meaningfully increased revenues from core operations and pre-tax net income.  The increased revenues reflect an improved net interest margin and growth in non-interest revenues.
Banner's balance sheet and operating results for the year were impacted by the acquisition of Skagit Bancorp, Inc. on November 1, 2018, which expanded Banner's presence in the attractive North Sound region in Northwest Washington State.  In addition, following a balance sheet restructuring in 2017 to postpone the adverse impact of the Durbin Amendment on debit card interchange fees, Banner renewed its leveraging strategy as it crossed the $10 billion in total assets threshold and ended the year with $11.86 billion in assets.  Aside from those one-time events, core operations were solid, with strong net interest income and other revenues contributing to record pre-tax earnings for the year.
Highlights of performance in 2018 include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข The acquisition of Skagit Bancorp, Inc., which provided $915.8 million of assets, $632.4 million of loans and $810.2 of deposits;

โข $392 million, or 12%, growth in non-interest-bearing deposits;  
โข $940 million, or 13%, growth in core deposits, with core deposits representing 86% of total deposits;  
โข Revenues from core operations increased 9% to $512.0 million;  
โข Net interest margin was 4.43% compared to 4.24% in 2017;

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights.  Our executive compensation program encourages and rewards sustainable growth in company value, while prudently managing risk and aligning the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders.  The structure of our program has been important in support of our growth objectives and the critical need to keep our most senior leaders focused on the execution of our business strategy.  The pay-for-performance and governance principles that guide our program were fundamental to the following compensation decisions made by the Compensation Committee for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Base salaries: Salary increases were 3% for Mr. Grescovich, Mr. Barton, Ms. Purcell and Mr. Western, 13.3% for Mr. Conner and 0% for Mr. Baker, all consistent with general staff salary increases for the year, except for Mr. Conner, whose promotion to the Chief Financial Officer was the major consideration for the increase, and for Mr. Baker, who retired on April 30, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข 2018 annual incentive results:  While performance against goals varied by performance measure, each of the named executive officers earned annual incentive payouts between 107% and 116% of their overall target opportunities.  Please see the discussion beginning on page 20 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข 2016-18 performance shares results: Performance shares granted in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance cycle vested at 50.0% of target.  Please see the discussion beginning on page 22 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
            Results of Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation.  We are required to periodically permit shareholders to vote to approve executive compensation, commonly known as a say-on-pay proposal.  At the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, the resolution was approved by over 97% of the shares present for purposes of voting on executive compensation.  The Board and Compensation Committee considered the affirmative vote of the shareholders on the say-on-pay resolution at last year's annual meeting as additional confirmation that our existing executive compensation practices were reasonable and aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
Executive Compensation Practices.  We are committed to strong compensation governance and continually monitor the evolution of best compensation practices.  Some of the more important practices incorporated into our program include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Regular review of pay versus performance. The Compensation Committee continually reviews the relationship between executive compensation (particularly Chief Executive Officer) and Banner's performance on both an absolute basis and relative to its compensation benchmarking peer group (described in the section entitled "Compensation Benchmarking").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Rigorous and diversified performance metrics.  The Compensation Committee annually reviews performance goals for our annual and long-term incentive awards to assure the use of diversified and rigorous but attainable goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข No repricing or cash buyouts of underwater stock options or stock appreciation rights.  Exercise prices are not allowed to be reduced, nor are outstanding awards allowed to be replaced with stock options or stock appreciation rights with a lower exercise price, without shareholder approval (except to adjust for stock splits or similar transactions), and Banner does not allow buyouts of underwater stock options or stock appreciation rights under any circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Use of double-triggers.  All change-in-control severance arrangements and accelerated vesting on all equity awards have a double-trigger, rather than a single-trigger for benefit eligibility.  This means that a change-in-control will not automatically entitle an executive to severance benefits or acceleration of vesting in outstanding equity awards; the executive must also lose his or her job, suffer a significant adverse change to employment terms and conditions, or be denied the continuation (or replacement) of the outstanding unvested awards by the acquiring company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข No excessive perquisites.  We provide limited perquisites to our executives that are consistent with the practices of our peer group and other comparable financial institutions.  Benefits include use of company cars, auto allowances and/or club memberships believed to be advantageous to Banner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข No tax gross-ups.  Parachute excise tax reimbursements and gross-ups will not be provided in the event of a change-in-control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Clawback of compensation. The Annual and Long-term Incentive Plans both provide that incentive awards are subject to clawback in the event that Banner is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to error, omission or fraud.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Review of Committee charter. The Compensation Committee reviews its charter annually to incorporate best-in-class governance practices.  The charter is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix B.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Program Objectives and Governance
Objectives and Overview of the Compensation Program.  Our executive compensation policies are designed to establish an appropriate relationship between executive pay and the annual and long-term performance of Banner and Banner Bank, to reflect the attainment of short- and long-term financial performance goals, to enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, and to align the interests of management and shareholders.  The principles underlying the executive compensation policies include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข attract and retain key executives who are vital to our long-term success and are of the highest caliber;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข provide levels of compensation competitive with those offered throughout the financial industry and consistent with our level of performance, complexity and market capitalization;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข motivate executives to enhance long-term shareholder value by granting awards tied to the value of our common stock; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข integrate the compensation program with our annual and long-term strategic planning and performance measurement processes.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committees of Banner and Banner Bank consider a variety of subjective and objective factors in determining the compensation package for individual executives including: (1) the performance of Banner and Banner Bank as a whole with emphasis on annual performance factors and long-term objectives; (2) the responsibilities assigned to each executive; and (3) the performance of each executive of assigned responsibilities as measured by the progress of Banner and Banner Bank during the year.
Target Total Direct Compensation.  A significant portion of total compensation opportunity for our executives is performance-based, with goals focused on growing sustainable company value while prudently managing risk. Performance-based pay comprised 46% of our Chief Executive Officer's target total direct compensation opportunity in 2018 and 38% to 39% for the other named executive officers.  The following table provides a summary:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Use of Compensation Consultants.  From time to time, Banner's Compensation Committee engages outside advisors to assist the Committee with its responsibilities.  The Committee has engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners ("Pearl Meyer"), an independent consulting firm, to serve as the independent consultant to the Committee regarding executive  and director compensation matters.  Pearl Meyer is retained by, and reports directly to, the Committee, and provided no other services to Banner in 2018.  Based on standards promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ to assess compensation advisor independence, as well as the analysis conducted by Pearl Meyer in its independence review, the Compensation Committee has concluded that Pearl Meyer is an independent and conflict-free advisor to the Committee.
Compensation Benchmarking
In 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer to prepare a total compensation benchmarking analysis for Banner's Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers and non-employee directors.  The comparison companies were selected by the Committee in consultation with Pearl Meyer and the underlying data was based on the most recent public filings of Banner and the peer companies.  The 2017 peer group approved by the Committee was based on the following criteria: (1) listed on the NYSE, NYSEAM or NASDAQ exchanges; (2) within 0.5 to 2.4 times Banner's asset size; and (3) likely competitor for executive talent.  These criteria resulted in a peer group consisting of the following 23 financial institutions, ranging in total assets from $8.1 billion to $21.9 billion, and headquartered throughout the United States:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Bank of California, Inc.   NBT Bancorp Inc.  
   BancorpSouth, Inc.   Old National Bancorp  
   Chemical Financial Corporation   PacWest Bancorp  
   Columbia Banking System, Inc.   Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.  
   CVB Financial Corp.   PrivateBancorp, Inc.  
   First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.   Trustmark Corporation  
   First Midwest Bancorp, Inc.   Union Bankshares Corporation  
   Fulton Financial Corporation   United Bankshares, Inc.  
   Glacier Bancorp, Inc.   United Community Banks, Inc.  
   Great Western Bancorp, Inc.   Washington Federal, Inc.  
   Home BancShares, Inc.   Western Alliance Bancorporation  
   IBERIABANK Corporation    
[END TABLE]
Pearl Meyer presented the results of its benchmarking analysis to the Compensation Committee in June 2017.  The analysis provided benchmarks for base salary, annual incentive, target and actual total cash compensation, long-term incentives, target and actual total direct compensation and target and actual total remuneration, including retirement benefits and perquisites.  For each combination of pay, the data was presented at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile measures.  The Committee does not target a specific percentile measure for any particular component of compensation, but rather uses benchmarking information to provide important context for the competitiveness of its compensation arrangements.  The Committee considered the results of the 2017 benchmarking analysis when making the 2018 pay decisions described below.
In the second quarter of 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer to prepare an updated total compensation benchmarking analysis.  For the 2018 analysis, the Committee approved a revised peer group consisting of the following 24 financial institutions, ranging in total assets from $8.3 billion to $25.0 billion and headquartered throughout the United States:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Bank of California, Inc.   NBT Bancorp Inc.  
   BancorpSouth, Inc.   Old National Bancorp  
   Chemical Financial Corporation   PacWest Bancorp  
   Columbia Banking System, Inc.   Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.  
   CVB Financial Corp.   Renasant Corporation  
   First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.   Simmons First National Corp.  
   First Merchants Corporation   Trustmark Corporation  
   First Midwest Bancorp, Inc.   Union Bankshares Corporation  
   Fulton Financial Corporation   United Bankshares, Inc.  
   Glacier Bancorp, Inc.   United Community Banks, Inc.  
   Great Western Bancorp, Inc.   Washington Federal, Inc.  
   Home BancShares, Inc.   Western Alliance Bancorporation  
[END TABLE]
 In addition to being used for the benchmarking analysis, the 2018 peer group is used for purposes of calculating relative performance under the 2018 Executive Incentive Plan described below.  Pearl Meyer presented the results of its benchmarking analysis to the Compensation Committee in June 2018.  The Committee will consider the findings from the 2018 analysis when making pay decisions in 2019.
Compensation Program
The Compensation Committees focus primarily on the following four components in forming the total compensation package for our named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข base salary;  
โข short-term incentive compensation;  
โข long-term incentive compensation; and  
โข participation in a supplemental executive retirement program.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salary.  The salary levels of named executive officers are designed to be competitive within the banking and financial services industries.  The Compensation Committees take a number of factors into account when setting the base salaries of the named executive officers.  These factors include peer data provided by compensation consultants, the officer's level of experience, the responsibilities assigned to the officer, the officer's performance during the previous year, and Banner's overall financial health.  In 2018, the named executive officers received 3% increases, consistent with general staff increases for the year, with the exception of Mr. Conner who received 13.3% due to his promotion to Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Baker who received 0% due to his retirement.  In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved increases of 3% for Messrs. Grescovich, Barton and Western.  To recognize exceptional performance and continued increase in the scope of their roles, as well as to align to our compensation philosophy of providing market competitive pay for top talent, Mr. Conner received an 8% increase and Ms. Purcell received a 7% increase.
Incentive Compensation.  We believe that performance-based pay opportunities and stock ownership by our officers are significant factors in aligning the interests of the officers with those of shareholders.  Our shareholders have approved the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  These plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, other stock-based awards and other cash awards.  The Omnibus Incentive Plans are intended to provide us flexibility in our ability to motivate, attract, and retain the services of employees and directors upon whose judgment, interest and special effort we depend.  We will continue granting awards under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan until no rewards remain available for grant.  At that time, we will begin granting awards under the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
Awards granted under our incentive plans are determined based upon the officers' level of responsibility and expected contributions to Banner and Banner Bank as judged by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.  The Compensation Committee considers a number of factors in granting awards.  These factors differ from year to year, but are fundamentally driven by the Committee's view on what is necessary to most effectively support Banner's business and leadership strategies.
Short-term Incentive Compensation.  The Compensation Committees of Banner and Banner Bank adopted criteria and rules for awarding and paying annual incentive payments to the named executive officers, as set forth in the Banner Corporation 2018 Executive Incentive Plan ("Executive Incentive Plan").  The purpose of the Executive Incentive Plan is to reward executives for their contributions to the performance and success of Banner and Banner Bank.  The Chief Executive Officer and all Executive Vice Presidents are eligible to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan, subject to certain eligibility requirements, with the participants identified each year by the Compensation Committee after being proposed by our Chief Executive Officer.  The Executive Incentive Plan's plan year corresponds to our fiscal year of January 1 to December 31.  Each participant is assigned a target award opportunity, which is expressed as a percentage of base salary, and a range of payout opportunities from 0% up to 150% of the target incentive.  Awards are determined based on a weighted combination of corporate and individual performance goals, which, with the exception of incentives for the Chief Executive Officer, are established and proposed by the Chief Executive Officer, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee.  The weighted combination of corporate and individual performance goals for the Chief Executive Officer is determined by the Compensation Committee. On March 26, 2018, the Compensation Committee selected the participants under the Executive Incentive Plan and established performance goals for all participants.  The participants in the Plan are the Chief Executive Officer and all Executive Vice Presidents.  The annual incentive opportunities for the named executive officers, expressed as a percentage of base salary earned during 2018, were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive    Below  Threshold    Threshold (50%)    Target (100%)    Stretch/Max (150%)  
 Executive    Below  Threshold    Threshold (50%)    Target (100%)    Stretch/Max (150%)  
 Executive    Below  Threshold    Threshold (50%)    Target (100%)    Stretch/Max (150%)  
 Mark J. Grescovich     0%     40%     80%     120%  
 Richard B. Barton     0%     25%     50%     75%  
 Peter J. Conner     0%     25%     50%     75%  
 Cynthia D. Purcell     0%     25%     50%     75%  
 Keith A. Western     0%     25%     50%     75%  
 Lloyd W. Baker     0%     25%     50%     75%  
[END TABLE]
The portion of the Executive Incentive Plan award tied to corporate performance is based on relative and absolute performance requirements for measures established by the Compensation Committee.  If Banner's financial performance relative to its 2018 peer group of financial institutions (see the "Compensation Benchmarking" discussion above) is below the 25th percentile, the payout associated with that measure will not exceed the target payout, regardless of absolute performance, unless the Compensation Committee exercises discretion to waive the requirement.  For the 2018 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee approved the following corporate performance measures for the named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Absolute Performance Goals    Weighting (% of 
 Performance Measure     Threshold     Target     Stretch      Target Opportunity)  
 Return on average assets (1)       1.57%       1.67%       1.93%       30%

 Payout as a percentage of target       50%       100%       150%        
(1)  Net income before income taxes and before provision for loan and lease losses, excluding foreclosed property expense and amortization of intangibles, adjusted to remove realized gains/losses on securities, nonrecurring items and trading account income, divided by average total assets. We used data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence in determining the nonrecurring adjustments.  
(2)  Noninterest expense before foreclosed property expense, amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairments as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest revenues, excluding realized gains/losses on securities, nonrecurring items and trading account income. We used data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence in determining the nonrecurring adjustments.  
(3)  No payout below target performance.  
(4)  Nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing and other real estate owned as a percentage of total assets, as of December 31, 2018.  
(5)  Net interest income plus non-interest income, adjusted to remove trading account income; does not include realized gains/losses on securities or nonrecurring revenue.  
[END TABLE]
Individual performance goals are established at the beginning of each plan year.  An executive's individual goals may relate to responsibilities, projects and initiatives specific to the executive's business or function that are not covered in the corporate performance measurements, such as integration activities, new software or program implementation, and efficiency initiatives.  The Compensation Committee establishes and approves corporate performance goals for all of the named executive officers and individual goals for the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer establishes and approves individual goals for the other participants.  The Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust awards as needed to reflect the business environment and market conditions that may affect Banner's performance and incentive plan funding, or to waive, change or amend any of the Plan provisions as it deems appropriate.  Incentive awards are subject to clawback if Banner is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to error, omission or fraud. 2018 Executive Incentive Plan Results.  The following table summarizes Banner's performance and resulting payouts associated with the corporate goals for 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Absolute Performance Measure  Performance  Achieved  Payout Earned as  a% of Target

 (1)   Relative performance exceeded the minimum threshold, qualifying for payout at the calculated level.  
 (2)   Although the efficiency ratio performance exceeded the target goal, relative performance failed to exceed the required 25th percentile necessary to pay out above target for this measure.  
 (3)   For relative performance purposes, performance is compared to peers in terms of annualized rate of growth, measured as total operating revenue for the twelve-month period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, as compared to total operating revenue for the twelve-month period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Grescovich's overall individual performance in 2018 was effective and that his leadership was instrumental in the improvement of Banner's operating performance, execution of the successful build-out of Banner's compliance and risk management infrastructure to address the increased complexity of operations and the acquisition of Skagit Bancorp, Inc. and Skagit Bank.  The Committee also noted significant personnel management and executive hiring decisions and felt that Mr. Grescovich's representation of Banner in the investment community was both professional and productive.  The Committee awarded Mr. Grescovich with a payout for 2018 individual goal performance equal to $126,535 (100% of target).  Evaluation of 2018 performance against individual goals for the other named executive officers resulted in 100% of target payout for Mr. Barton, 125% of target payout for Mr. Conner and Ms. Purcell, and 80% of target payout for Mr. Western.
The named executive officers earned total annual incentive payouts between 107% and 116% of target opportunity for performance during 2018, as summarized below.

On March 26, 2018, in connection with the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Committee established the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under which the Committee determined to grant both time-based and performance-based awards effective April 2, 2018 to each of the named executive officers.  The time-based awards are detailed below in the Grants of Plan-based Awards table.  The time-based restricted stock units vest ratably over a three-year period beginning on April 2, 2019 and ending on the third anniversary of the grant date.
Awards of performance-based restricted stock units ("performance units") are contingent on attaining pre-established three-year performance goals.  The Compensation Committee reviews and approves goals in consultation with management.  The Committee established threshold, target and stretch performance levels and associated payouts.  At the end of the performance cycle, resulting payouts are determined based on Banner's performance relative to the peer financial institutions.  For the awards made in 2018, the Committee approved the following corporate performance measures, weightings and relative performance goals:

(2)  Net income before amortization of intangibles and goodwill (tax-adjusted), divided by average tangible common equity; the measure used for relative comparisons will be an average of the calculated results for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, each determined separately.  
(3)  Total shareholder return from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, assuming that dividends paid during the period are reinvested in the respective company's shares on the date paid.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee approved target long-term incentive awards expressed as a percentage of base salary which were subsequently denominated in shares based on the average of the closing prices of Banner's stock on the ten days prior to the date of grant.  Awards for 2018 were allocated between restricted stock units and performance units, illustrated below as a percentage of base salary:

[END TABLE]
The Grants of Plan-based Awards Table provides additional detail relating to the 2018 unit awards for the named executive officers.
Recipients of time-based restricted stock units accumulate dividends during the restriction period and do not have the power to vote unvested units.  Recipients of performance units are also entitled to dividends but only as and when the shares to which the dividends are attributable become vested.  Recipients of performance units do not have voting rights with respect to unvested units.  If Banner is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to error, omission or fraud, executive officers may be required to reimburse Banner for part or the entire incentive award made to the officer on the basis of having met or exceeded specific targets for performance periods.  The Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust awards as needed to reflect the business environment and market conditions that may affect Banner's performance and incentive plan funding.
Performance shares for the 2016-18 Performance Cycle.  For the performance-based restricted stock awards made in 2016, the Committee approved the following corporate performance measures, weightings and relative performance goals:

(1)  Peer companies for the 2016-18 performance cycle consisted of all U.S. commercial banks (or their holding companies) traded on Nasdaq, NYSE or NYSE American (formerly NYSE MKT) with total assets between 50% and 200% of Banner's total assets as of December 31, 2018.  
(2)  Return on average assets ("ROAA") was determined based on net income before income taxes and before provision for loan and lease losses ("pre-tax pre-provision ROAA") from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018; the measure used for relative comparisons was an average of the calculated pre-tax pre-provision ROAA for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, each determined separately.  
(3)  Total shareholder return from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018; this measure was calculated assuming that dividends during the period were reinvested in Banner shares on the date paid.  
[END TABLE]
Performance Shares Vesting for the 2016-18 Performance Cycle.  Performance shares granted in the first quarter of 2016 vested at 50.0% of target, based on 0% pretax pre-provision return on average assets vesting and 100.0% total shareholder return vesting.  Relative performance for pretax pre-provision return on average assets for Banner during the 2016-2018 performance cycle was at the 25th percentile of peers and relative total shareholder return over this period was at the 50th percentile of peers.  The required minimum threshold performance level was the 30th percentile for both performance measures.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Program.  We have adopted a supplemental executive retirement program ("SERP") in which Mr. Baker, Mr. Barton and Ms. Purcell participate.  The SERP is intended to encourage retention by ensuring that the executives reach a targeted retirement income, recognizing their value to Banner and rewarding them for their long-term service commitments.  At termination of employment at or after retirement age and achievement of a service requirement, the executive's annual benefit under the SERP, which may be reduced by certain other retirement benefits, would be computed as a percentage of the executive's final average compensation (as defined in the plan) and the executive's annual years of service (called the "supplemental benefit").  The executives are eligible for a reduced benefit upon early retirement if they meet the years of service requirements in their individual agreements; however, no benefit payment will begin before retirement age.  The SERP also provides for payments in the event of an executive's disability or death, or termination in the event of a change in control, all as discussed in further detail below, under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."  Executives' receipt of payments under the SERP are subject to confidentiality and non-competition provisions.  The executive officers have the status of unsecured creditors of Banner Bank with respect to the benefits accrued under the SERP.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
We have historically structured incentive compensation arrangements with a view toward qualifying them as performance-based compensation exempt from the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"), although we have viewed and continue to view the availability of a tax deduction as only one relevant consideration.  The Compensation Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that attracts, retains and rewards the executive talent necessary for our success.
Federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017 eliminated the Section 162(m) performance-based compensation exemption prospectively and made other changes to Section 162(m), but with a transition rule that preserves the performance-based compensation exemption for certain arrangements and awards in place as of November 2, 2017.  We intend to continue to administer arrangements and awards subject to this transition rule with a view toward preserving their eligibility for the performance-based compensation exemption to the extent practicable.

Employment Agreements and Perquisites.  We have entered into employment agreements with each of the named executive officers.  The initial term of each agreement may be extended annually for an additional year at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board.  The employment agreements were extended on July 1, 2018 for each of the named executive officers, other than Mr. Baker.  Under the agreements, the current base salaries for Mr. Grescovich, Mr. Barton, Mr. Conner, Ms. Purcell and Mr. Western are $795,675, $291,682, $340,000, $336,657 and $333,023, respectively.  Each executive's annual base salary must be reviewed annually and will be adjusted from time to time to reflect amounts approved by the Board or Board Committee.
The executives may participate with other executive officers of Banner Bank in such performance-based and discretionary bonuses, and incentive compensation opportunities, if any, as are authorized by the Board or Board committee.  The executives also may be eligible to participate in equity or incentive award programs sponsored by Banner Bank.  The executives may participate, to the same extent as executive officers of Banner Bank generally, in all Bank plans relating to pension, retirement, thrift, profit-sharing, savings, group or other life insurance, hospitalization, medical and dental coverage, travel and accident insurance, education, cash bonuses, and other retirement or employee benefits or combinations thereof.  In addition, the executives are entitled to participate in any other fringe benefit plans or perquisites which are generally available to Banner Bank's executive officers, including but not limited to supplemental retirement, deferred compensation programs, supplemental medical or life insurance plans, company cars, club dues and physical examinations.  The executives also will be provided an automobile for their business use, monthly club and/or gym membership dues, and other employee benefits such as vacation and sick leave.  The agreements also provide that compensation may be paid in the event of disability, death, involuntary termination or a change in control, as described below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
401(k) Profit Sharing Plan.  We provide a 401(k) profit sharing plan.  The Board of Directors has appointed an administrative committee of Banner Bank officers to administer the 401(k) plan, and the named executive officers participate in this plan.  On an annual basis, the Board of Directors establishes the level of employer contributions to the 401(k) plan, which applies to all eligible participants including the named executive officers.  In 2018, we matched participants' contributions into the 401(k) plan up to four percent of eligible earnings for each payroll period. Grants of Plan-Based Awards

Supplemental Executive Retirement Program.  We adopted a SERP for Mr. Barton, Ms. Purcell and Mr. Baker.  Banner Bank has purchased life insurance on both of the executives in an amount sufficient to recover the benefits payable under the SERP, payable upon their deaths.  The SERP provides for payments in the event of retirement, early retirement, disability, involuntary termination following a change in control and death.  Mr. Baker retired in 2018 and began receiving payments.  These payments are discussed in further detail below, under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."

Of these amounts, the following amounts were previously reported as other compensation to the officers in the Summary Compensation Table: for Mr. Barton, $10,398; Ms. Purcell, $8,421; Mr. Western, $376; and for Mr. Baker, $6,762.  
[END TABLE]
In 2004, we adopted deferred compensation plans which allow executive officers of Banner to defer all or part of their cash compensation or non-qualified stock options until retirement.  Each executive officer may direct the investment of the deferred compensation toward the purchase of life insurance, Banner common stock, mutual fund-style investments or a stable value account.  We established grantor trusts to hold the common stock and mutual fund-style investments.  The assets of the trusts are considered part of our general assets and the executive officers have the status  of unsecured creditors of Banner with respect to the trust assets.  The deferred compensation agreements provide pre-retirement death and disability benefits in an amount based on the value of the executive officer's account balance upon the occurrence of either event.  At retirement, an executive officer, as previously elected, may receive the balance of his or her account in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period not exceeding ten years.  At December 31, 2018, our estimated deferred compensation liability accrual with respect to executive officers under these agreements was $737,000.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
We have entered into agreements with the named executive officers that provide for potential payments upon disability, termination, early retirement, normal retirement and death.  In addition, our equity plans also provide for potential payments upon termination.

[END TABLE]
Employment Agreements.  The employment agreements with each of the named executive officers provide for payments in the event of death, disability or termination.  In the event of an executive's death during the term of his or her employment agreement, we will pay to the executive's estate the compensation due through the last day of the calendar month in which his or her death occurred. Mr. Grescovich's agreement provides that if he becomes entitled to benefits under the terms of the then-current disability plan, if any, of Banner or Banner Bank or becomes otherwise unable to fulfill his duties under his employment agreement, he shall be entitled to receive such group and other disability benefits as are then provided for executive employees.  In the event of his disability, the employment agreement is not suspended, except that (1) the obligation to pay Mr. Grescovich's salary will be reduced by the amount of disability income benefits he receives and (2) upon a resolution adopted by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, Banner or Banner Bank may discontinue payment of his salary beginning six months following a determination that he has become entitled to benefits under the disability plan or otherwise unable to fulfill his duties under his agreement. If Mr. Grescovich's disability does not constitute a disability within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and he is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A, then disability payments will not begin until the earlier of his death or the sixth month anniversary of his separation from service.
The employment agreements with each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Grescovich provide that if the executive becomes disabled or incapacitated to the extent that he or she is unable to perform the duties of his or her position, he or she shall receive short-term disability benefits equal to 100% of his or her monthly compensation beginning on the 15th day of disability and continuing until the 180th day of disability and long-term disability benefits equal to 66โ% of monthly salary beginning on the 181st day of disability and continuing until he or she attains age 65.  These benefits will be reduced by the amount of any benefits payable to the executive under any other disability program of Banner Bank.  The Bank currently provides disability benefits with certain limitations to all full time employees.  In addition, during any period of disability, the executive and his or her dependents shall, to the greatest extent possible, continue to be covered under all executive benefits plans of Banner Bank, including without limitation, its retirement plans, life insurance plan and health insurance plans, as if actively employed by Banner Bank.  If the executive is disabled for a continuous period exceeding six calendar months, Banner Bank may, at its election, terminate the employment agreement.  If the executive's disability does not constitute a disability within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and the executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A, then disability payments will not begin until the earlier of the executive's death or the sixth month anniversary of the executive's separation from service.
The employment of the executives is terminable at any time for just cause as defined in the agreements.  In addition, the employment of an executive may be terminated without just cause, in which case the agreements provide that the named executive officers other than Mr. Grescovich would continue to receive (1) base salary over the remaining term and (2) the executive's group life insurance, hospitalization, medical, dental, prescription drug and other health benefits, and long-term disability insurance for the remaining term.  Mr. Grescovich's agreement provides that we must pay him a lump sum equal to two times the sum of (1) his annual salary in effect on the date of termination and (2) any unearned performance-based bonus based on the target opportunity on the date of termination.  We would also be required to pay to him any earned but unpaid performance-based bonus and continue his group life insurance, hospitalization, medical, dental, prescription drug and other health benefits, and long-term disability insurance for 24 months after the date of termination.
The employment agreements also provide for benefits in the event of the executives' termination in connection with a change in control.  For the named executive officers other than Mr. Grescovich, if, within six months prior to a change in control or 24 months after a change in control, we (or our acquiror) terminate an executive's employment or otherwise change the circumstances in which he or she is employed, or cause a reduction in responsibilities or authority or compensation or other benefits provided under the employment agreement without consent, other than for just cause, the agreements provide that we must pay to the executive and provide him or her, or the his or her beneficiaries, dependents and estate, with the following: (1) 2.99 times the executive's base amount as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (and for Mr. Conner, his target annual bonus opportunity); and (2) during the period of 36 calendar months beginning with the event of termination, continued coverage under all Banner employee benefit plans as if the executive were still employed during that period under the employment agreement.  If Mr. Grescovich's employment is terminated within 24 months of a change in control, we must pay him a lump sum equal to three times the sum of (1) his annual salary in effect on the date of termination and (2) any unearned performance-based bonus based on the target opportunity on the date of termination.  We would also be required to pay to him any earned but unpaid performance-based bonus and continue his group life insurance, hospitalization, medical, dental, prescription drug and other health benefits, and long-term disability insurance for 36 months after the date of termination.  The employment agreements limit these payments and do not allow payments of amounts in excess of the limits imposed by Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Supplemental Executive Retirement Program. We adopted a SERP for Messrs. Baker and Barton, and Ms. Purcell.  At termination of employment at or after attaining age 62 (age 68 for Mr. Barton) and having achieved a service requirement, the executive's annual benefit under the SERP would be computed as the product of 3% (4% for Mr. Barton) of the executive's final average compensation (defined as the three calendar years of the executive's annual cash compensation, including bonuses, which produce the highest average within the executive's final eight full calendar years of employment) and the executive's annual years of service (subsequent to January 1, 2007 for Mr. Barton) (called the "supplemental benefit").  However, the supplemental benefit would be limited such that the sum of (1) amounts payable from the executive's other retirement benefits from Banner and Banner Bank and (2) the supplemental benefit may not exceed 60% of final average compensation (for Mr. Barton, the supplemental benefit may not exceed the product of 3% times his total years of service and his final average compensation).  Payment of the supplemental benefit begins on the first day of the month next following the executive's retirement date and continues monthly for the executive's life, unless the executive is a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), in which case payment begins on the first day of the month following the six-month anniversary of the executive's termination of employment.  The executives are eligible for a reduced benefit upon retirement prior to age 62 (age 68 for Mr. Barton) if they meet the years of service requirements in their individual agreements; however, no benefit payment will begin before age 62 (age 68 for Mr. Barton) and payments will be subject to the delayed distribution requirements if the executive is a specified employee.
In the event of an executive's death, the executive's surviving spouse shall receive a spouse's supplemental benefit.  If the death occurs following the executive's retirement date, the surviving spouse shall be entitled to a spouse's supplemental benefit, payable for life, equal to 50% of the monthly amount of the supplemental benefit payable to the executive prior to his or her death.  If the death occurs while the executive is actively employed by Banner or any of its affiliates, the surviving spouse shall receive a spouse's supplement benefit equal to 50% of the amount the executive would have received as a supplemental benefit if the executive's retirement date had occurred on the date immediately preceding the executive's death.
With respect to each of the named executive officers, the agreement provides that in the event of the executive's involuntary termination of employment on or after the effective date of a change in control, the date of termination shall be treated as the executive's retirement date and he or she shall be entitled to receive a supplemental benefit.  If the executive had reached his or her retirement date, the supplemental benefit would be calculated as described above for normal retirement and if the executive had not reached his or her retirement date but had satisfied the years of service requirement, the supplemental benefit would be calculated as described above for early retirement.  No benefit payment will begin before age 62 (age 68 for Mr. Barton) and payments will be subject to the delayed distribution requirements if the executive is a specified employee.
The supplemental benefit shall cease to be paid to the executive (and rights to the spouse's supplemental benefit shall terminate) if the executive (1) discloses material confidential information or trade secrets concerning Banner Bank or any of its subsidiaries without its consent or (2) engages in any activity that is materially damaging to the Bank including engaging in competitive employment during the three-year period beginning on the executive's retirement date (or in the case of Mr. Barton, during the two-year period beginning on the date of his involuntary termination of employment on or after the effective date of a change of control).
Equity Plans.  The 2012 Restricted Stock and Incentive Bonus Plan, as amended on April 23, 2013, provides that accelerated vesting of restricted stock will occur only upon completion of a change in control and involuntary separation from employment (including voluntary separation for good reason) of the recipient during the 12-month period following the effective date of the change in control (known as a "double trigger").  The 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan was amended in 2015 to provide that restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards will become fully vested and stock options and stock appreciation rights will become fully exercisable only upon a double trigger.  Our 2012 Restricted Stock and Inventive Bonus Plan and 2014 Omnibus Equity Plan also provide for accelerated vesting of awards if a recipient's service is terminated as a result of death or disability.
Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio
In August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the SEC adopted Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the  annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee's annual total compensation.  For 2018, this information is as follows:

โข Mr. Grescovich, Chief Executive Officer, annual total compensation:                                                                                       $2,513,936  
โข Median employee annual total compensation:                                                                                                                              $     62,463  
โข Ratio of Chief Executive Officer to median employee compensation:                                                                                              40 to 1  
[END TABLE]
We have concluded that it is appropriate to use the median employee from our 2018 disclosure for our 2019 disclosure.  It is our reasonable belief that doing so will not significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure as there has been no material change to the employee population or employee compensation arrangements during the 2018 calendar year.  In determining the median employee for the initial 2018 disclosure, we used a listing of all employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, as of December 31, 2017.  To identify our median employee, we included all elements of total direct compensation (defined as the total value of salaries, commissions, bonuses, and short- and long-term incentives provided regularly and consistently to the employee base) paid in 2017 as our consistently applied compensation measure. The value of long-term incentive awards issued during 2017 was based on the fair market value of the award at the time of grant. Compensation for full-time employees hired during 2017 was annualized.
As a result of the flexibility permitted by Item 402(u), the method we used to determine our median employee may differ from the methods used by our peers, so the ratios may not be comparable.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The members of the Compensation Committee are Roberto R. Herencia, Connie R. Collingsworth, Brent A. Orrico and Merline Saintil.  No members of the Compensation Committee were officers or employees of Banner or any of its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2018, nor were they formerly Banner officers or had any relationships otherwise requiring disclosure.
 PROPOSAL 2 โ ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically include in our annual meeting proxy statements and present at the annual meeting of shareholders a non-binding shareholder resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation of Banner's executives as disclosed in the Proxy Statement.  The say-on-pay proposal will be presented at the annual meeting in the form of the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Banner Corporation's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material in the Proxy Statement for the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
This vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.  It will also not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive.  The Compensation Committee and the Board may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
Our executive compensation policies are designed to establish an appropriate relationship between executive pay and the annual and long-term performance of Banner and Banner Bank, to reflect the attainment of short- and long-term financial performance goals, to enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, and to align to the greatest extent possible the interests of management and shareholders.  Our Board of Directors believes that our compensation policies and procedures achieve these objectives.  The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.   PROPOSAL 3 โ ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF
FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we were required to include in the proxy statement for the 2013 annual meeting of shareholders a non-binding shareholder vote to consider the timing of future shareholder votes on executive compensation.  Shareholders voted in favor of holding an annual vote on executive compensation and the Board of Directors determined to adopt an annual frequency.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that shareholders be permitted to vote on the frequency of future votes on executive compensation at least once every six years.  Accordingly, we are including in this Proxy Statement and presenting at this year's annual meeting a non-binding shareholder vote to consider the timing of future shareholder votes on executive compensation.  This proposal gives shareholders the opportunity to vote on whether a resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers should be presented to shareholders every one, two or three years, or to abstain from voting.
The Board of Directors believes that a resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers should be presented to shareholders every year because the Board is committed to strong corporate governance and an annual cycle provides for the greatest accountability to our shareholders.
This vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.  It also will not affect when the shareholders will be asked to vote on executive compensation in future years.  The Compensation Committee and the Board will, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering when to present shareholders with a resolution to approve executive compensation.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote for conducting an advisory vote on executive compensation EVERY YEAR.
 AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS  
Audit Committee Charter.  The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by our Board of Directors.  The Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors and is responsible for overseeing and monitoring our financial accounting and reporting, system of internal controls established by management and audit process.

  PROPOSAL 4 โ RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 and that selection is being submitted to shareholders for ratification.  Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of Moss Adams LLP to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.  If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another registered public accounting firm.  Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Banner and our shareholders.  Moss Adams LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a representative of the firm will be present at the annual meeting to respond to shareholders' questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed, or expected to be billed, to us by Moss Adams LLP for professional services rendered for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 (1)   Fees for 2018 include estimated amounts to be billed.  
 (2)   Fees for 2018 and 2017 include consultation regarding Affordable Care Act compliance and tax depreciation.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee will establish general guidelines for the permissible scope and nature of any permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the Committee's annual review of its charter.  Pre-approval may be granted by action of the full Audit Committee or by delegated authority to one or more members of the Audit Committee.  If this authority is delegated, all approved non-audit services will be presented to the Audit Committee at its next meeting.  In considering non-audit services, the Audit Committee or its delegate will consider various factors, including but not limited to, whether it would be beneficial to  have the service provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and whether the service could compromise the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee approved all of the services provided by Moss Adams LLP that were designated as audit-related fees, tax fees and all other fees as set forth in the table above.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors determined that all of the services performed by Moss Adams LLP in fiscal year 2018 were not incompatible with Moss Adams LLP maintaining its independence.
 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE  
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of Banner's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC.  Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms we have received and written representations provided to us by these persons, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2018, all filing requirements applicable to our reporting officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders were properly and timely complied with.

APPENDIX A
BANNER CORPORATION AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
I.            Purpose
The Audit Committee ("Committee") is a standing committee of the Board of Directors ("Board") of Banner Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Corporation").  The primary function of the Committee is to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and the audits of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.  In addition, the Committee also assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to (a) the quality and integrity of financial reports and other financial information provided by the Corporation and the Corporation's systems of internal accounting and financial controls; (b) the annual appointment of the Corporation's Independent Registered Public Accounting firm ("Independent Auditor") and the oversight and periodic evaluation of the Independent Auditor's qualifications, independence and performance; (c) the performance and oversight of the Corporation's internal audit function including the annual performance review and compensation of the Chief Audit Executive; (d) the compliance by the Corporation with legal and regulatory requirements, including disclosure, controls and procedures with respect to financial reporting matters; and (e) the fulfillment of the other responsibilities set forth herein.  The Committee shall also review and approve the report required by Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules to be included in the Corporation's annual meeting proxy statement.
The Committee has the full and complete authority to act for and on behalf of the Corporation's bank subsidiary, Banner Bank (the "Bank"), in the exercise of the Audit Committee responsibilities of the Bank pursuant to authority granted to the Committee by the By-laws of the Bank and the Board.
While the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits, to prepare the Corporation's consolidated financial statements or disclosures or to determine that the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and are in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and applicable rules and regulations. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Corporation's financial statements including the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and for the appropriateness of the accounting principles and reporting policies used by the Corporation. The Independent Auditor is responsible for auditing the Corporations' consolidated financial statements and adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and for reviewing the Corporation's unaudited interim financial statements. Likewise, it is not the Committee's responsibility to conduct investigations, or to assure that the Corporation complies with specific legal requirements or the Corporation's code of ethics. Each member of the Committee will be entitled to rely, to the fullest extent permitted by law, upon the integrity of those persons or organizations within and outside the Corporation from whom it receives information, and the accuracy of the information.
II.            Composition
The Committee shall consist of three or more directors as determined by the Board, each of whom shall be an independent director, and free from any relationships that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment, as a member of the Committee.  No member of the Committee can have participated in the preparation of the Corporation's financial statements at any time during the past three years.
All members of the Committee shall have a working familiarity of basic finance and accounting practices, including being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including the Corporation's consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement and consolidated cash flow statement.  At least one member of the Committee must be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation SโK.  A person who satisfies this definition of an audit committee financial expert will also be presumed to have financial sophistication.  The Committee will also include members with banking or related financial management expertise.  Furthermore, the Committee will not include any members who are large customers of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries as determined by the Board.
A-1  
Member independence, experience and financial expertise will be in conformance with rules established by the SEC, the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, FDIC, and the AICPA, including, but not limited to, the requirements of Rule 10Aโ3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 12 C.F.R. 363.5.  The members of the Committee shall be elected by the Board, based on recommendations from the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, at the annual organizational meeting of the Board and shall serve until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.  The Board may remove or replace any member from the Committee at any time with or without cause.
The Board, in consultation with the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, will determine whether the Committee includes appropriate membership with banking or related financial management, as such qualifications are interpreted by the Board in its business judgment, and whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. Unless a Chair is selected by the full Board, the members of the Committee may designate a Chair by majority vote of the full Committee membership.  The Chair, or its designee, will preside over all meetings of the Committee and set the agendas for Committee meetings.
III.            Meetings and Structure
The Committee shall meet as often as it determines, but not less than eight times per year.
As part of its job to foster open communication, the Committee shall meet periodically with management, the Chief Audit Executive and representatives of the Independent Auditor in separate executive sessions to discuss any matters that the Committee or each of these groups believes should be discussed privately.
In addition to other agenda items and related timing as determined by the Chair, the Committee shall meet at least quarterly with management, the Chief Audit Executive and the Independent Auditor to review the preparation of and procedures performed over the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, receive required communications from the Independent Auditor and discuss material changes, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting with management and the Chief Audit Executive.
The Committee may also meet separately with regulatory examiners.
The Committee is governed in accordance with Article IV of the Banner Corporation's Bylaws and such other procedures as may be fixed by the Committee to the extent consistent with the Bylaws.
An agenda and supporting materials shall be sent to members prior to each meeting.  Minutes will be prepared to document the discharge of the Committee's responsibilities.  The Committee shall make regular reports to the Board of Directors.
IV.            Responsibilities and Duties
The Independent Auditor is accountable to the Board of Directors and the Committee as representatives of the shareholders.  The Committee is directly responsible for the selection, appointment, compensation, retention, termination and oversight of the work of any independent registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the Corporation, and each such independent registered public accounting firm shall report directly to the Committee.  The Committee shall review, at least annually, the qualifications, performance and independence of the Independent Auditors (primary or otherwise) and present its conclusions with respect to the selection, retention or termination of the Independent Auditors to the Board. To fulfill its responsibilities and duties, the Committee shall have the following authority and responsibilities and any other activities consistent with this Charter, Banner Corporation's Bylaws, and governing law as the Board or Committee deems necessary or appropriate:
