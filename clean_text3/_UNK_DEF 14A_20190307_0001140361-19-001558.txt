Dear Member:
You are cordially invited to the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Members of Lincolnway Energy, LLC (the "Company") which will be held at the Radisson Hotel Ames Conference Center at ISU, 2609 University Blvd., Ames, Iowa on Thursday, March 7, 2019, commencing at 6:30 p.m. (the "2019 Annual Meeting").
A Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (which includes information about the proxy card, proxy statement, notice of annual         meeting and our 2018 annual report (the "Proxy Materials")) was mailed to our members on or about January 25, 2019, and the Proxy Materials have been posted on our website         at www.linconwayenergy.com.  We urge all members to access the Proxy Materials, print the proxy card, fill it out and send it to us to count your votes for the 2019 Annual         Meeting.  We will also mail proxy cards to all members on or about February 4, 2019.
Details of the business to be conducted at our 2019 Annual Meeting are provided in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of           Members and Proxy Statement.
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT and it is important that your units be represented and voted at the meeting.  The directors therefore urge you to carefully review all of the Proxy Materials, and then complete, sign         and date the proxy card and promptly return it in the reply envelope.  You can also print the proxy card off from our website (www.lincolnwayenergy.com) and return it to the         Company.  In either case, your proxy card must be received at the Company's principal office at 59511 W. Lincoln Highway, Nevada, Iowa 50201, before 3:00 p.m. on March 7, 2019 in order to be valid.  This will also help ensure a quorum at the         meeting and will save the Company the expense and extra work of additional solicitations.  If you return your proxy card before the meeting and decide that you want to change your vote, you can do so at any time before the voting results are         announced at the meeting by either coming to the Company's principal office before 3:00 p.m. on March 7, 2019 or by coming to the 2019 Annual Meeting and notifying any director at any time before the voting results are announced at the meeting.  In         either case, you will be given another proxy card to complete and deliver either at the 2019 Annual Meeting or to the Company's principal office at any time before 3:00 p.m. on March 7, 2019.
On behalf of the directors, I would like to thank you for your continued interest in the affairs of Lincolnway Energy, LLC, and we look         forward to seeing you at our 2019 Annual Meeting.

PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF MEMBERS
TO BE HELD ON MARCH 7, 2019
This Proxy Statement is being provided by Lincolnway Energy, LLC         (the "Company," "we," or "us")                in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Members (the "2019 Annual Meeting") that will be held on March 7, 2019, commencing at 6:30         p.m., at the Radisson Hotel Ames Conference Center at ISU, 2609 University Blvd., Ames, Iowa, and any adjournment or postponement thereof.  If you need directions to the Radisson Hotel Ames Conference Center at ISU, please call the Company at (515)         232-1010.  A copy of our annual report to members on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 ("Fiscal                    Year 2018"), which includes our financial statements for Fiscal Year 2018 (the "Annual Report") has been made available to our members along with this Proxy Statement.  Beginning on or about January 25, 2019, we made this Proxy Statement available to our members.
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR
THE MEMBERS' MEETING TO BE HELD ON MARCH 7, 2019
Our Proxy Statement and Annual Report are also available online at www.lincolnwayenergy.com
Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules, we have elected to use the Internet as our primary means of furnishing           proxy materials to our members.  Consequently, most members will not receive paper copies of our proxy materials.  We instead sent our members a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Internet Availability Notice") containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report via the Internet.  The Internet Availability Notice also included instructions on how to           receive a paper copy of your proxy materials, if you so choose.  If you received your annual meeting materials by mail, your proxy materials, including your proxy card, were enclosed.  We believe that this process expedites members' receipt of           proxy materials, lowers the costs of our 2019 Annual Meeting and helps to conserve natural resources.
This Proxy Statement, the Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting, proxy card and our Annual Report may be requested by calling or e-mailing Kay Gammon at (515)         232-1010 or kgammon@lincolnwayenergy.com or accessing www.lincolnwayenergy.com and clicking         on the "Investor" tab.

[END TABLE]

Lincoln Highway, Nevada, Iowa 50201 any time before 3:00 p.m. on March 7, 2019.

[END TABLE]
As stated above, if you request a proxy card to vote your units at the 2019 Annual Meeting and you are the beneficial owner of your units and not the holder of record, you will need to bring with you a legal proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, fiduciary, trustee, custodian         or other nominee authorizing you to vote the units.

Q:  How will the proxies designated on the proxy card vote a member's units with respect to each proposal?  
[END TABLE]

A:  Your units will be voted in accordance with the instructions you indicate when you submit your proxy card.  If you submit a proxy card, but do not indicate your voting                      instructions, your units will be voted as follows:  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can a member nominate director candidates for next year's annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  This question is answered below in the section entitled "Directors and Corporation                        Governance – Director Nomination Process."  
[END TABLE]
DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Director Independence
The Company is currently governed by nine (9) directors.  The Company has determined that each of our directors, and each nominee for election as a         director, meet the standards of independence applicable to companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (though our units are not listed on any exchange or quotation system), including that each director and nominee for election as a director is         free of any relationship that would interfere with his individual exercise of independent judgment.
Leadership Structure
Our directors elect a Chairman and a Vice Chairman with the Chairman responsible for presiding over and acting as chairperson of all meetings of our         directors and our members.  If the Chairman is not present, the Vice Chairman serves as chairperson of the director or member meeting.  Jeff Taylor is currently the Chairman and William Couser is the current Vice Chairman.  Eric Hakmiller serves as         our President and Chief Executive Officer which is separate from the role of the Chairman so the same individual does not serve as both the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
We believe a leadership structure providing for the separation of the role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the         Company and its members because it allocates the oversight of the business among the directors and the executive officers so that our Chief Executive Officer, who reports to our directors, can focus on the day-to-day business operations, and our         Chairman and directors can oversee the activities of the Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers and the business as a whole.  We have determined that this leadership structure allows our directors to better focus on their oversight role         and provide us a perspective that is independent from that of our management.  We do not have a policy mandating the leadership structure and our directors reserve the right to determine the appropriate leadership structure from time to time.
Directors' Role in Risk Oversight
Although management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks to the Company, our directors provide broad oversight of the Company's risk         management programs.  In this oversight role, our directors are responsible for satisfying themselves that the risk management processes designed and implemented by the Company's management are functioning and that the systems and processes in         place will bring to their attention the material risks facing the Company in order to permit our directors to effectively oversee the management of these risks.  A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company         faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company.  The involvement of our directors in the risk oversight process allows our directors to assess management's         appetite for risk and also to determine what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company.  Our directors regularly include agenda items at their meetings relating to their risk oversight role and meet with various members of management         on a range of topics, including corporate governance and regulatory obligations, operations and significant transactions, business continuity planning, succession planning, risk management, insurance, pending and threatened litigation and         significant commercial disputes. While our directors as a whole provide broad oversight of the Company's risk management           processes, various committees of our directors also oversee risk management in their respective areas and regularly report on their activities to all of our directors.  Principally, the Risk Committee assists our directors in identifying         and quantifying methods of mitigating or eliminating risk, primarily those relating to commodity prices.  In addition, the Audit Committee focuses on assessing and mitigating financial           risk, including internal controls and the Finance Committee also assists our directors in the oversight of financial risk, including, without limitation, risks relating to our capital structure, investments, tax and financing activities.  The           Human Resources and Compensation Committee strives to create compensation incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with the Company's business strategy.  Additional information on the standing director committees is           set forth below in the section entitled "Directors and Corporate Governance - Committees of the Directors."
We believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company and that         our leadership structure provides appropriate checks and balances against undue risk taking.
Compensation Risk Analysis
We have reviewed our material compensation policies and practices for all employees and have concluded that these policies and practices are not reasonably         likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  While risk-taking is a necessary part of growing a business, our compensation philosophy, as discussed below in the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," is focused on aligning compensation with the long-term interests of our members as opposed to rewarding short-term management decisions that could pose long-term risks.          Specifically, our compensation programs contain design features that mitigate the likelihood of inducing excessive risk-taking behavior.
Director and Committee Meetings and Director Attendance
The directors held a total of 14 meetings (including regularly-scheduled and special meetings) during Fiscal Year 2018.  In addition, the Audit Committee         held 5 meetings, the Nominating and Company Governance Committee held 2 meetings, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee held 2 meetings, the Risk Committee held 7 meetings and the Finance Committee held 1 meeting.  No incumbent director         attended fewer than seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate of the director meetings and committee meetings held on which an incumbent director served during Fiscal Year 2018.
We do not have any formal policy with regard to directors' attendance at annual meetings of our members; however, we encourage all of our directors to         attend the annual meeting of our members.  All nine of our directors serving in March 2018 attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Members held on March 5, 2018.
Committees of the Directors
Our directors have standing Audit, Nominating and Company Governance, Human Resource and Compensation, Finance and Risk Committees.
Nominating and Company Governance Committee
The Nominating and Company Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee")         operates under a written charter which is available on our website at www.lincolnwayenergy.com in the "Investors" section.  During Fiscal Year 2018, the members of the         Nominating Committee were Tim Fevold (Chair), Terry Wycoff, Kurt Olson and Brian Conrad each of whom served on the committee during all of Fiscal Year 2018.  The current members of the Nominating Committee are Tim Fevold (Chair), Kurt Olson and         Brian Conrad.  The general functions performed by the Nominating Committee are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• oversee the governance of the Company, including the operations of the directors and their committees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identify individuals qualified to become directors and recommend nominees for election as director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• monitor developments in corporate governance practices; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• oversee the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  
[END TABLE]
 The Nominating Committee reviews with the directors the skills and characteristics that should be required of director nominees in the context of the         current skill sets and characteristics of the existing directors and the business and operational environment of the Company at the time of the recommendation.
The Nominating Committee attempts to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experiences for the directors as a whole and for individual         directors, with the objective of having an overall composition of directors with diverse backgrounds and experience in business and public service, and not necessarily only in the ethanol industry.  The Nominating Committee does not have a policy         with regard to, and does not otherwise consider, diversity in identifying nominees for director, other than diversity in backgrounds and experience as otherwise discussed in this paragraph.  Prospective nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability or any other basis proscribed by law.
The Nominating Committee considers the need for diverse backgrounds and experience together with the qualifications of individual director candidates and         the characteristics expected of all directors which include independence, integrity, high personal and professional ethics, sound business judgment, and the ability and willingness to commit sufficient time to serve as a director.  In evaluating         the suitability of individual director candidates, the Nominating Committee takes into account many factors, including the individual's general understanding of marketing, finance, agricultural markets and other disciplines relevant to the success         of a company of our size with our capital structure in the renewable fuels industry; the individual's understanding of our business and operations; the individual's educational and professional background and the individual's personal         accomplishments.
In addition, the Nominating Committee evaluates each individual in the context of the directors as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group of         nominees that will best represent our member interests through the exercise of sound business judgment using the directors' diversity of experience and better position us for success.  In determining whether to recommend an incumbent director for         re-election, the Nominating Committee also considers the director's past attendance at meetings and the director's participation in and contributions to the activities of the directors.  All nominees recommended by the Nominating Committee are         subject to approval by the directors.
The Nominating Committee will generally first look to our members to identify possible director nominees.  The Nominating Committee will consider and         evaluate members for possible director nominees on its own, but will also consider any suggestions by other directors.  The Nominating Committee also may, but is not required to, consider any suggestions for director nominees by our members.  The         Nominating Committee is not, however, required to only consider or to only nominate members as nominees for director, and the Nominating Committee is free to recommend any individual as a director nominee.  Although we do not currently contemplate         using any search firm or other outside parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating director nominees, the Nominating Committee, with the approval of the directors, may retain search firms or other outside parties and         approve payment of fees to those firms or parties.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter which is available on our website at www.lincolnwayenergy.com         in the "Investors" section.

The current members         of the Audit Committee are James Dickson (Chair), Brian Conrad, Tim Fevold and Rick Vaughan.  Our directors have determined that each of the directors serving on the Audit Committee during Fiscal Year 2018 met the standards of independence         applicable to companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (though our units are not listed on any exchange or quotation system), including that they are free of any relationship that would interfere with his individual exercise of independent         judgment.  During Fiscal Year 2018, the directors determined that James Dickson met the definition of an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in applicable SEC regulations.
The general function performed by the Audit Committee is to assist the directors in their oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting,         auditing and reporting practices of the Company.  The Audit Committee's role includes overseeing the audit of our financial statements and the work of the Company's internal accounting and financial reporting and internal auditing processes, and         discussing with management the Company's processes to manage business and financial risk.  The Audit Committee is also responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent auditor engaged to prepare or issue         audit reports on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting.  The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities.

We will disclose amendments to, or waivers of,         certain provisions of our Code of Ethics relating to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller or persons performing similar functions on our website promptly following the adoption of any such amendment or waiver. Director Nomination Process
Section 4.3 of the Operating Agreement provides that the directors, or a Nominating Committee established by the directors, shall prepare a list of         nominees for each director position to be filled at the next annual meeting of the members.  Our directors have a standing Nominating Committee and the role of the Nominating Committee includes identifying, evaluating and recommending director         candidates to the directors.   The Nominating Committee reviews director nominee candidates from the incumbent directors and recommendations from members or other third parties and then makes a recommendation to our directors regarding the director         nominees.  When reviewing director nominee candidates, the Nominating Committee takes into consideration the criteria described below in the section entitled "Proposal                  1 – Election of Directors."
Member Recommendations
The Nominating Committee considers member recommendations for director nominee candidates and affirmatively seeks recommendations for candidates from our         members on an annual basis.  The Nominating Committee reviews any recommendations received from its members using the same criteria used to review incumbent directors which criteria is described below in the section entitled "Proposal 1 – Election of Directors."
Member Nomination Process
Pursuant to Section 4.3 of our Operating Agreement, a member or group of members owning at least 5% of the outstanding units may nominate an individual for         election as a director at the next annual meeting by submitting a written nomination petition in a form provided by the Company if the nomination petition is received at the Company's principal office no sooner than the October 1 but not later than         the November 30 which precedes the annual meeting at which the member seeks to nominate a director.  Each nomination petition must be accompanied by a nominee statement that complies with the requirements set forth in Section 4.3 of the Operating         Agreement including, without limitation, an agreement that the nominee will (i) serve as a director if elected, (ii) prepare, execute and/or file all such reports and documents, and provide the Company with all such information, as may be necessary         or appropriate in order for the Company to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and (iii) provide all information and all agreements and representations as are determined to be necessary or appropriate by the directors or the         President.
Any nomination petition or nominee statement which is not fully completed and properly executed, is not received within the time period provided above or         is not true, accurate and complete in all respects, may be rejected by the Company and, if rejected, shall be returned by the Company to the member or members submitting the nomination petition or to the nominee submitting the nominee statement, as         the case may be.  Each nominee must meet all qualification requirements for directors as may exist at the time of the nomination and at the time of election.
The Company did not receive a nomination petition from any member relating to a director nomination for the 2019 Annual Meeting.
No Floor Nominations
Section 4.3 of the Operating Agreement expressly provides that no nominations for any director position may be made from the floor at any meeting of the         members.
PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
We currently have nine (9) directors with each director elected to a three-year term and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.  The terms of         the directors are staggered such that three directors are up for election every year.  The terms of the directors expire at the annual meeting of our members.  There are currently three directors with terms set to expire at the 2019 Annual         Meeting.  There is also another director with a term set to expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting since such individual   was elected by the directors to fill the vacancy resulting from the resignation of Terry Wycoff.  Additional information on such         additional director nominee is set forth below under the section entitled "Proposal 2 – Election of Director Appointed to Fill Vacancy."
Based on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, our directors have nominated for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting the following incumbent         directors: James Dickson, James Hill and Kurt Olson.  The three director nominees elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Members and thereafter until their respective successors are elected and qualified.          Each of  the director nominees are incumbent directors. The names of the director nominees, along with certain information concerning each nominee, is set forth below under the section entitled "Information on Director Nominees."  Our directors have no reason to doubt the availability of the nominees and no reason to believe the nominees will be unable or         unwilling to serve the entire term for which election is sought.
In making its recommendations for director nominees, the Nominating Committee takes into consideration the diversity considerations and other criteria         discussed above in the section entitled "Directors and Corporate Governance – Nominating Committee" when selecting and evaluating director candidates.  In         particular, the Nominating Committee believes that a director should:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· be an individual of the highest character and integrity;  
· be free of any conflict of interest that would violate any applicable laws, rules, or regulations or interfere with the proper performance of the responsibilities of a                      director;  
· be willing and able to devote sufficient time to the affairs of the Company; and  
· have the capacity and desire to represent the balanced, best interests of the Company's members as a whole.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that each of the director nominees bring these qualifications to the Company.  In addition to the foregoing general criteria, as previously         discussed, the Nominating Committee considers specific criteria relating to the skills, experience, particular areas of expertise, specific backgrounds and other characteristics of the director nominees that may enhance the effectiveness of our         directors and their committees.
We believe our director nominees and continuing directors represent a diverse complement of specific business skills, experience and perspectives,         including: financial and accounting expertise, historic experience with the Company, industry experience, business expertise and experience and senior leadership skills and experience.  Listed below are key skills and experience that we consider         important for our directors in light of our current business and structure.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Knowledge of the Company.  The Nominating Committee and our directors recognize                      that our current directors, including the incumbent director nominees, have gained substantial experience, background and institutional knowledge regarding the Company's operations and the ethanol industry in general through their                      long-term service as directors of the Company.  Six (6) of our current directors have served as directors since the Company was organized in May 2004 and one (1) director has served since July 27, 2007.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Industry Experience.  Since its organization in May 2004, the Company, along with                      the ethanol industry in general and the economy as a whole, has experienced a wide range of political, economic and market circumstances, ranging from very favorable to very difficult circumstances.  Our current directors, including the                      incumbent director nominees, have therefore gained valuable background and experience relating to the renewable fuels industry, the operation of an ethanol plant and management and oversight of agricultural and commodities markets                      critical for our operation over a diverse range of regulatory and economic market conditions.  This experience aids our directors in preparing for and dealing with challenging market conditions that may arise in the future.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business Expertise and Experience.  Each of our continuing directors and the                      director nominees has substantial individual experience in operating or managing a business through their own personal business endeavors that are discussed in the biographies below.  Each continuing director and director nominee has                      also demonstrated a willingness and ability in their individual businesses to consider and pursue innovative or new approaches, as well as a willingness and ability to assume leadership roles in those businesses and industries, all of                      which are attributes that are helpful in an evolving and changing industry such as the ethanol industry.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial Expertise.  We believe our continuing directors and the director                      nominees bring a significant collective knowledge of financial markets, financing and funding operations, and accounting and financial reporting processes and related skills and experiences necessary to understand and oversee our                      capital structure, financing and investing activities, financial reporting and internal control of such activities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senior Leadership Experience.  Many of our continuing directors and director                      nominees have served in senior leadership positions which is important, as these directors bring experience and perspective in analyzing, shaping, and overseeing the execution of important strategic, operational and policy issues at a                      senior level.  These directors' and director nominees' insights and guidance, and their ability to assess and respond to situations encountered in serving as directors of our Company, is also enhanced when their leadership experience                      has been developed at businesses or organizations that operate within the ethanol, renewable energy, agricultural or financial industries.

Terry Wycoff is a former director who resigned effective December 31, 2018.

PROPOSAL 2 - ELECTION OF DIRECTOR APPOINTED TO FILL VACANCY
In connection with the resignation of Terry Wycoff as a director effective December 31, 2018, pursuant to Section 4.10 of our Operating Agreement, on         January 4, 2019, the remaining directors elected Douglas Moore to fill the vacancy created upon Mr. Wycoff's resignation.  In accordance with Section 4.10 of the Operating Agreement, Mr. Moore will serve until the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of         Members.
Under Section 4.10 of our Operating Agreement, any vacancy occurring for any reason in a director position (including through an increase in the number of         directors or the death, removal or resignation of any director) may be filled by either the remaining directors or by the members, except that only the members may fill a vacancy occurring because of the removal of a director by the members.          Section 4.10 also provides that an individual elected by the directors to fill a vacancy shall continue to serve as a director only until the next annual meeting of the members, at which time the members shall elect an individual to such director         position, who shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term of such director position. If Mr. Moore is elected by the members he will serve as a director until the 2021 Annual Meeting of Members which is the remainder of the unexpired term of         the director position previously held by Terry Wycoff or until his successor shall be elected and qualified.
As noted above under "Proposal 1 – Election of Directors," in         making its recommendations for director nominees, the Nominating Committee takes into consideration the diversity considerations and other criteria discussed above in the section entitled "Directors and Corporate Governance – Nominating Committee" when selecting and evaluating director candidates.  Also as noted above under "Proposal 1 – Election of Directors," the Nominating Committee also considers specific criteria relating to the skills, experience, particular areas of expertise, specific backgrounds and other characteristics of the         director nominees that may enhance the effectiveness of our directors and their committees.
Mr. Moore is the owner and founder of EuroSource LLC based in Ames, Iowa which was formed in September 2008.  EuroSource LLC provides secondhand machinery,         valuations and liquidation services in the composite panel industry throughout the U.S. and Canada.  Since 2014, Doug has been a partner in Iowa Tarping Solutions LLC, providing feedstock protection services for cellulosic ethanol raw material.            Doug also serves as President of Ames Seed Capital, a community venture capital fund based in Ames, Iowa.
Based on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, our directors have nominated Douglas Moore for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting to serve until         the 2021 Annual Meeting of Members.  We believe Mr. Moore brings to the Company substantial domestic and international business management experience and industry expertise as well as significant knowledge of financial markets, financing and         funding operations.  Our directors have no reason to doubt the availability of the director nominee and no reason to believe the nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve the entire term for which election is sought.
Vote Required
Election of Mr. Moore requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the units represented in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting, assuming a         quorum is present.  A plurality vote means that nominee who receives the highest number of votes will be elected to fill the director position.  Abstentions or proxies or ballots marked to "withhold authority" will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business but will not be counted as votes cast for or against this proposal.
OUR DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT THE MEMBERS VOTE "FOR" THE         ELECTION OF MR. MOORE TO SERVE FOR A TWO-YEAR TERM. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Compensation paid to our directors is reviewed and determined on an annual basis by the directors.  We do not provide our directors with any equity or         equity option awards, nor any non-equity incentive payments or deferred compensation.  Similarly, we do not provide our directors with any other perquisites, "gross-ups," defined contribution plans, consulting fees, life insurance premium payments         or otherwise.  Our director compensation program provides that each director receives an annual retainer of $18,000 which constitutes a fee of $1,500 per month.  The Chairman is paid an additional $6,000 annual retainer and the Vice Chairman,         Secretary and Treasurer are each paid an additional $1,200 annual retainer.  There was no change in the fees paid to the directors in Fiscal Year 2018 from the fees paid during the previous fiscal year.

[BEGIN TABLE]

 Kris Strum   Director of Finance (Principal Financial Officer)  
[END TABLE]
Details of the compensation provided to our Named Executive Officers for Fiscal Year 2018 are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table that follows this         discussion.
Compensation Objectives and Policies
The compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers are administered by our Compensation Committee and reviewed on an annual basis.  The         Compensation Committee also reviews and discusses the Company's compensation programs with our directors from time to time.  The objective of our programs is to provide a fair and competitive compensation package that will enable us to attract and         retain talented executives who are expected to be instrumental in achieving Company goals for growth and profitability and in positioning the Company to effectively compete in the rapidly evolving renewable fuels industry.  The Compensation         Committee believes that the compensation programs we offer must be competitive with financial arrangements provided to executive officers of other renewable fuels companies operating not only in Iowa, but throughout the Midwestern United States.          The compensation programs adopted by our Compensation Committee for Fiscal Year 2018, were designed to promote and reward both individual performance of the Named Executive Officers and their collective performance as members of the management         team.
Compensation related to individual performance is reflected primarily through the base salary established for each Named Executive Officer.  Collective         performance by the Named Executive Officers as a management team is rewarded primarily through the incentive arrangements focusing principally on Company profitability as the determinative factor for awarding additional compensation to the Named         Executive Officers.  In establishing the compensation programs, the Compensation Committee was guided by the policy that each Named Executive Officer should be assured of receiving a fair base salary that is reflective of the individual's         performance, experience and responsibilities within the organization, while at the same time providing an opportunity to receive additional compensation that is contingent upon the Named Executive Officer's ability to function as an effective         member of the management team in achieving Company profitability.
In February 2017, the overall compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers were submitted to our members for approval on a non-binding basis at         the 2017 Annual Meeting of Members.  Our members approved the overall compensation programs by approximately 88% of the units voting on the issue.  The Compensation Committee has considered the results of the member vote in evaluating the         compensation programs and believes that the substantial approval voiced by our members is an endorsement that the structure of the programs is functioning effectively to align the interests of our executive officers with member interests.
Components of Compensation Programs
The compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers during Fiscal Year 2018 consisted of the following components:
Base Salary
Each Named Executive Officer received a base salary as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table.  The purpose of the base salary was to provide a secure         source of cash compensation for the Name Executive Officer.  Base salary was paid in equal bi-weekly installments and was not contingent upon Company performance.  Adjustments to base salary consider the individual's overall performance,         contribution to the business and internal and external comparisons.  We believe the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers should provide competitive, fixed compensation to attract and retain exceptional executive talent.
Incentive Compensation
Each Named Executive Officer participated in an annual incentive compensation plan that provided an opportunity to earn additional compensation based on         Company performance.   The annual incentive compensation plans are discussed further below under the section entitled "Description of the Fiscal Year 2018 Annual           Incentive Plan."  We believe that an annual incentive compensation plan encourages and rewards our Named Executive Officers for achievement of annual financial, operational and strategic performance goals.  The potential amount received by         a Named Executive Officer varies to the degree we achieve our annual financial performance goals and the extent to which the respective executive officer contributes to the achievement. In addition, Mr. Hakmiller participates in an individual long-term incentive plan, the Equivalent Unit Plan, which is set forth in his employment agreement         and is based on the increased value in the Company's units.  The Equivalent Unit Plan is discussed further below in the section entitled "Analysis of Compensation           Decisions for Mr. Hakmiller."  We believe that Mr. Hakmiller's participation in this long-term incentive plan encourages him to focus on the long-term performance of the Company, links his incentives to our members' interest in increasing         our unit value and promotes long-term retention.
401(k) Plan Contributions
Each Named Executive Officer participated in the 401(k) Profit         Sharing Plan sponsored by the Company (the "401(k) Plan") and was entitled to receive employer contributions to their respective accounts.  The purpose of the 401(k) Plan         is to provide a vehicle for employees to accumulate retirement savings, funded in part through employer contributions.  The 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan in which all employees of the Company are entitled to participate after meeting         certain eligibility requirements.  Eligible participating employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are entitled to make contributions to the 401(k) Plan from their own salaries as well as to receive employer contributions.
Insurance and Disability Benefits
We provide our Named Executive Officers with basic life, health, dental and disability coverage benefits.  These benefits are the same as those provided to         other employees within the organization.
Perquisites
The Company generally does not provide additional or special executive-only benefits that are not part of our standard compensation practices or used to         address special circumstances such as relocations.
Severance Benefits
Except for the employment agreement with Mr. Hakmiller described below in the section entitled "CEO Employment Agreement" which requires thirty (30) days' notice of termination, we do not have employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers and their employment may be terminated at any time.          Other than the potential payout to Mr. Hakmiller under the Equivalent Unit Plan as defined and described below in the section entitled "Analysis of Fiscal Year 2018           Compensation Decisions for Mr. Hakmiller – Incentive Compensation," we do not have any severance agreements with our Named Executive Officers.
Description of Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Incentive Plan
Company Incentive Plan
In October 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a new variable compensation program (the "Company Incentive Plan") which covered the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and Fiscal Year 2018.  The Company Incentive Plan covered all eligible employees of the Company and was designed to motivate employees to work         together to produce the best possible financial results and to establish the Company as a leading ethanol production facility.  The Company Incentive Plan provides employees the opportunity to earn additional compensation based on Company         profitability represented by the Company's net income based on the Company's audited financial statements for the applicable fiscal year as may be adjusted to give credit for member distributions paid by the Company during the respective fiscal         year.   The structure of the Company Incentive Plan and the selection of net income as the key financial metric reflected the view of the Compensation Committee that additional compensation should be paid to the employees, including our Named         Executive Officers, only in the event we earned a profit for the year and, in addition, that the amount of additional compensation paid, if any, should be tied directly to the amount of profits earned.  Our directors designed the Company Incentive         Plan to encourage an individual's contribution to, and reward an individual for, Company-wide performance and in certain instances, the attainment of specific operational and financial goals that are controlled by, or can be directly impacted, by         the individual.
The Company Incentive Plan establishes different bonus pool plans with different funding mechanisms and payout percentages.  Allocation percentages among         the various bonus pools and the individual employees within each pool are based on the relative levels of responsibility within the organization and the current base salaries of the individuals in each pool.  The Company Incentive Plan establishes         separate bonus pools for staff, senior management and the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO").
The staff bonus pool provides for an annual inventive bonus pool equal to 5.4% of Company net income as set forth in the Company's audited financial         statements for the respective fiscal year.  The Company Incentive Program provides for maximum payout amounts based on a percentage of base salary for each employee tier within the staff bonus pool ranging from 8% of base pay and 18% of base         salary.  The actual payout amount allocated to each individual within the staff bonus pool is determined by calculating the employee's pro rata portion of the maximum payout amount multiplied by the available bonus pool.  Although the Company         Incentive Program provides for a maximum payout amount, the Committee retains the discretion to approve payouts in excess of the specified maximum if they believe that such decision is consistent with the Company philosophy of providing employees         with the maximum incentive to achieve superior Company performance and align their interest with the interest of our members.  In Fiscal Year 2018, since we reported a net loss as set forth in our Annual Report, no amounts were allocated to the         staff bonus pool and no employees within the staff bonus pool received any bonus awards. The senior management and CEO bonus pools provide payout amounts based on the Company's net income for the applicable fiscal year as set forth in the         Company's audited financial statements for the respective fiscal year less $4 million (the "Adjusted                    Net Income").  If the Adjusted Net Income is positive, each senior management participant will receive a payout equal to 0.5% of the Adjusted Net Income amount and the CEO will receive a payout equal to 1% of the Adjusted Net Income         amount.   There is no maximum payout amount under the Company Incentive Plan for participants in the senior management pool or CEO bonus pool.   The higher levels of allocation established for the senior management and CEO bonus pools, which         includes our Named Executive Officers, reflects the judgment of the Compensation Committee that these individuals have the potential for the most significant impact on Company operations and profitability.  In Fiscal Year 2018, since we reported a         net loss as set forth in our Annual Report, no amounts were allocated to the senior management or CEO bonus pools and no member of senior management or our CEO received any bonus awards.
Analysis of Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Decisions for Mr. Hakmiller
Base Salary
In connection with the negotiation of Mr. Hakmiller's employment agreement in 2013, the Compensation Committee reviewed information regarding base salaries         of principal executive officers of other renewable fuel firms operating primarily in the Midwest as a means of assessing the market value for such executives in the industry.  There was no attempt, however, to position Mr. Hakmiller's base salary         at any given point within the range of salaries reviewed.  Ultimately, his base salary was a negotiated figure based on comparable market rates.  Mr. Hakmiller's employment agreement provides for a minimum base salary of $232,000 which was his base         salary through fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.  In Fiscal Year 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the directors approved, increasing Mr. Hakmiller's base salary to $252,500 which represented a 2.5% cost of living increase.
Incentive Compensation
The following incentive compensation arrangements developed for Mr. Hakmiller focus both on (a) short-term performance which awards additional compensation         based on annual Company profitability, and (b) long-term performance which awards additional compensation linked to an increase in the value of our units over a longer period of time.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company Incentive Plan.  During Fiscal Year 2018, participated in the Company Incentive Plan                      together with senior management and other eligible employees to promote the objective of having employees, including the CEO, work together to produce the best possible financial results for the Company.  In accordance with the terms of                      the Company Incentive Plan, Mr. Hakmiller did not receive any bonus based on the fact that the Company recorded a net loss in Fiscal Year 2018 as set forth in our Annual Report.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equivalent Unit Plan. As a form of long-term incentive compensation, on April 9, 2013, the                      Compensation Committee granted Mr. Hakmiller an award of 100 equivalent units ("Equivalent Units") intended to approximate the value of a unit of the Company                      and provide him the opportunity to earn additional compensation tied directly to the increase in value of the Company's units during his employment with the Company or, if earlier, a sale of the company (the "Equivalent Unit Plan").  The Equivalent Unit Plan was included as an attachment to Mr.                      Hakmiller's employment agreement.  The Compensation Committee believed the grant of Equivalent Units would more closely align Mr. Hakmiller's interests with the interests of our members by providing him with an economic stake in the                      Company that was substantially similar to a member holding our units.  
[END TABLE]
The Equivalent Units granted to Mr. Hakmiller are not actual units of the Company and the Equivalent Units do not entitle him         to any rights as a member, including the right to vote at member meetings.  However, the Equivalent Unit Plan grants dividend equivalent rights which provide that if the Company declares a distribution to the members, the Company must pay Mr.         Hakmiller an amount equal to the per unit distribution declared for each Equivalent Unit.  The award granted to Mr. Hakmiller vested on April 9, 2016 (three years from the date of employment). The purpose of the vesting requirement was to establish         an "employment retention" feature whereby Mr. Hakmiller would be incentivized to continue his employment for at least three years. The Equivalent Unit Plan provides that after vesting, Mr. Hakmiller has the right to receive a lump sum cash payment upon certain         triggering events provided the value of his Equivalent Units has increased over an opening value of $500 per Equivalent Unit (the "opening value").  The opening value of         $500 per Equivalent Unit was determined by our directors based on their estimation of the fair market value of the Company's units at the time Mr. Hakmiller began employment in April 2013.  A payout is triggered upon Mr. Hakmiller's separation from         service (other than for "cause") as an employee or, if earlier, upon a sale of the Company to an unaffiliated party.  Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the then current value of the Equivalent Units will be determined (the "ending value") and the difference between the ending value and the opening value, if a positive number, will be paid to Mr. Hakmiller. The method of calculating the ending         value varies depending on the triggering event as described below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Separation of Service.  If the triggering event is Mr. Hakmiller's separation                      from service, the ending value of the Equivalent Units will be the average purchase price paid by buyers of our units through the unit matching service in transactions that closed during the six-month period preceding the month in which                      his employment terminates, provided that at least two such sales of units occurred during such period.  In the event there are not two sales during such period, the ending value of the Equivalent Units will then be set at an amount                      equal to 70% of the book value per unit determined as the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of his termination of service.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sale of the Company.  If the triggering event is a sale of the Company, the ending                      value of the Equivalent Units will be equal to the value of our units as determined by our directors in reference to the sale price of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
In the event that the Company's terminates Mr. Hakmiller for "cause" as defined in his employment agreement or for breach of any         fiduciary duty owed to, or restrictive covenant with, the Company, Mr. Hakmiller will automatically forfeit all vested Equivalent Units.
Analysis of Compensation Decisions for Ms. Strum
Base Salary
Adjustments to the base salary for Ms. Strum are determined by Mr. Hakmiller.  In considering Ms. Strum's base salary for Fiscal Year 2018, Mr. Hakmiller         considered her performance and level of responsibility within the organization and the financial performance of the Company during the previous year.   Mr. Hakmiller also considered the significant increases in Ms. Strum's responsibilities over the         past several fiscal years. Based on the significant increase in Ms. Strum's responsibilities, Mr. Hakmiller determined that it is in the best interest of the Company to make adjustments                  to Ms. Strum's base salary over several years in order to conform to the competitive market for executives with similar responsibilities.  Based on these considerations, Mr. Hakmiller increased Ms. Strum's base salary to $122,000 for         Fiscal Year 2018 representing a 15.4% increase.
Company Incentive Plan
As stated above, during Fiscal Year 2018, Ms. Strum fell within the senior management pool under the Company Incentive Plan.

See the section entitled "Compensation Discuss and Analysis" for additional details                        on the Company Incentive Plan.  
  2  Amounts reported in this column for Fiscal Year 2018 include: (i) contributions made by the Company to the 401(k) Plan for the account of each Named Executive Office                        during the fiscal year in amounts equal to $7,879 for Mr. Hakmiller and $3,797 for Ms. Strum, (ii) cash payments for unused paid time off accrued during the fiscal year in amounts equal to $4,817 for Mr. Hakmiller and $2,763 for Ms.                        Strum and (iii) a cash payment to Mr. Hakmiller of $2,500 in accordance with the dividend equivalent rights set forth in his Equivalent Unit Plan relating to the distributions to our members declared during Fiscal Year 2018.

1  The Company Incentive Plan did not designate a minimum amount of additional compensation that would                        be paid based on achieving a minimum or "threshold" level of company profitability or applicable performance metrics.  
2  The Company Incentive Plan did not designate a specific amount of additional compensation that would be paid based on achieving a designated or "targeted" level of                        Company profitability and therefore, the target amounts set forth above reflect the actual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer under the Company Incentive Plan during Fiscal Year 2018 as also set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" above. In accordance with the terms of the Company Incentive Plan, none of Named Executive Officers received any bonus                        payments based on the fact that the Company recorded a net loss in Fiscal Year 2018 as set forth in our Annual Report  
3  Under the Company Incentive Plan there is no maximum payout amount for participants in the senior management and CEO bonus pools.  
[END TABLE]
 CEO Employment Agreement
On April 9, 2013, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Eric Hakmiller pursuant to which we retained Mr. Hakmiller as the President and Chief           Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO Employment Agreement").  The CEO Employment Agreement provides for an annual salary of not less than $232,000 and that Mr.           Hakmiller has the right to participate in the other fringe benefits available to employees of the Company (i.e. medical, dental disability or life insurance, 401(k) or other retirement plans or programs).  The CEO Employment Agreement also           includes the Equivalent Unit Plan described above in the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Analysis of Compensation Decisions for Mr.             Hakmiller."
The CEO Employment Agreement remains in effect until it is terminated in accordance with its terms.  The CEO Employment Agreement will terminate           automatically upon the death or disability of Mr. Hakmiller. The CEO Employment Agreement may also be terminated by the Company for "cause", as that term is defined in the CEO Employment Agreement, or by Mr. Hakmiller in the event of any uncured           breach of the CEO Employment Agreement by the Company.  Both the Company and Mr. Hakmiller may also elect to terminate the CEO Employment Agreement at any time for any reason which termination upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice.
No Change of Control or Severance Agreements
Other than the vesting of the Equivalent Units granted to Mr. Hakmiller under the Equivalent Unit Plan discussed above under the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Analysis of Compensation Decisions for Mr. Hakmiller" and below in the section entitled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control," our executive officers do not have change of control or severance agreements, which means our directors retain discretion           over severance arrangements if the directors decide to terminate an executive's employment.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
The only compensation program of the Company that provides for potential payments upon termination of employment or upon a change in control is the           Equivalent Unit Plan for Mr. Hakmiller.  The Equivalent Unit Plan is described in detail above under the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis –             Analysis of Compensation Decisions for Mr. Hakmiller", including the specific circumstances that would trigger a payout, the manner in which the amount of the payout would be determined and the vesting and forfeiture conditions           applicable to his Equivalent Units.
Upon the vesting of Mr. Hakmiller's Equivalent Units (which occurred on April 9, 2016),             the Equivalent Unit Plan, provides a potential payout to Mr. Hakmiller (i) upon the termination of his employment with the Company other than for "cause" or (ii) upon the Sale of the Company (assuming he remains an employee at the time of such             sale).  The Equivalent Unit Plan defines "Sale of the Company" as a (A) a sale of all or           substantially all of the assets of the Company in any transaction or series of related transactions, other than to an entity that controls or is controlled by the Company or pursuant to the granting of, or the enforcement of, any mortgage,           security interest, financing statement or other lien on any of the assets of the Company or any affiliate; (B) any merger, consolidation or reorganization to which the Company is a party, if immediately following such transaction the members of           the Company immediately prior to the transaction hold less than 50% of the voting power of the Company's or its successor's equity interests; or (C) a sale of a majority of the voting power of the Company's equity interests by the members of the           Company in any transaction or series of related transactions other than to an entity that controls or is controlled by the Company prior to such sale.
In the event that the Company's terminates Mr. Hakmiller for "cause" as defined in the CEO Employment Agreement or for breach of any fiduciary duty owed           to, or restrictive covenant with, the Company, Mr. Hakmiller will automatically forfeit all vested or unvested Equivalent Units.
Potential Post-Termination Benefits Table
The table below quantifies the compensation that would have become payable to Mr. Hakmiller pursuant to the Equivalent Unit Plan for Mr. Hakmiller's           Equivalent Units in the event his employment had terminated on September 30, 2018 under various circumstances. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The estimates of the potential payouts to Mr. Hakmiller under the Equivalent Unit Plan set forth in the table above are based on the following           calculations:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (A)  Sale of the Company:  Assumes a per unit sale price paid by a third party to the                        Company in connection with a Sale of the Company equal to the book value of the Company's units as of September 30, 2018 which was $904 per unit.  The ending value for the Equivalent Units would have been $904 per unit, resulting in                        an increase of value of $404 per Equivalent Unit, determined by subtracting the opening value of $500 per unit from the ending value of $904 per unit and multiplying it by the 100 Equivalent Units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (B)  Termination of Employment for All Other Reasons.  Assumes an ending value for                        the Equivalent Units of $599 per unit which results in an increase of value of $99 per Equivalent Unit, calculated by subtracting the opening value of $500 per unit from the ending value of $599 per unit, then multiplying it by 100                        Equivalent Units.  The ending value of the Equivalent Units would have been determined by dividing (i) the aggregate amount paid by all buyers of the Company's units pursuant to the unit matching service during the six months prior to                        September 30, 2018, and (ii) the aggregate number of units sold to those buyers.  During that six-month period, there were eight sales transactions, with sales prices ranging from a low of $480 per unit to a high of $700 per unit.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee was at any time during Fiscal Year 2018, or at any other time, an officer or employee of the Company. No           executive officer of the Company serves as a director or a member of a compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as one of our directors or as a member of our Compensation Committee.
Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the           following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Eric Hakmiller, our Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO").
The CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  For our Fiscal Year 2018, the ratio of           the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of the medial employee was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Total Annual  Compensation  
    Total Annual  Compensation  
 Chief Executive Officer     $   265,461   1   
 Median Employee     $   52,180    
 CEO Pay Ratio     5:1    
[END TABLE]
1 Reflects the annual total compensation of our                     CEO reported in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement set forth above.
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median           employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  We determined that, as of September 30, 2018, the last day of our Fiscal Year 2018, our employee population consisted of forty-one individuals with all of these                        individuals located in the United States. This population consisted of our full-time and part-time employees.  We selected September 30, 2018, which is the last day of our Fiscal Year 2018 as the date upon which we would identify the                        "median employee" because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  To identify the median employee from our employee population, we calculated the amount of the total cash compensation earned during Fiscal Year 2018 as reflected in our                        payroll records which was consistently applied to all of our employees, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on September 30, 2018 (whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis). We believe the use of total cash                        compensation earned by our employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not distribute equity awards to employees.  For purposes of calculating the total cash compensation earned, we included the following                        for each of our employees included in the calculation: (i) actual base salary paid (in the case of hourly workers, base salary paid included overtime pay), (ii) cash bonuses earned for Fiscal Year 2018 and (iii) paid time off.  We did not perform any full-time equivalency adjustments for part-time or temporary employees or annualize for employees hired throughout the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. Since all our                        employees are located in the United States, as is our CEO, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  As  noted above, with respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table                        include in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference under Item 11 of Part III of our Annual Report.  
[END TABLE]
The pay ratio disclosed above was calculated in accordance with SEC rules based upon the Company's reasonable judgment and assumptions using the           methodology described above. The SEC rules do not specify a single methodology for identification of the median employee or calculation of the pay ratio, and other companies may use assumptions and methodologies that are different from those used           by the Company in calculating their pay ratio. Accordingly, the pay ratio disclosed by other companies may not be comparable to the Company's estimated pay ratio as disclosed above.
PROPOSAL 3
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Our directors and the Audit Committee have selected RSM US LLP ("RSM") as           the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (sometimes referred to in this Proxy Statement as our "independent auditor") for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and our directors are asking the members to ratify that           selection.  RSM has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since October 2005.  Although the engagement, retention and supervision of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is within the authority of our           directors and the Audit Committee, the directors consider the selection of the auditor to be an important matter of member concern and are submitting the selection of RSM for ratification by the members as a matter of good corporate practice.
One or more representatives of RSM are expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement at the meeting           if they desire to do so, and are also expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Disclosure of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by RSM for the audit of our annual financial statements for the fiscal years ended           September 30, 2018 and 2017 and fees billed for other services rendered by RSM during those periods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Year Ended September 30,    
      2018       2017    
 Audit Fees     $   83,265       $   82,635    
 Audit Related Fees     $   5,800       $   5,800    
 Tax Fees     $   25,799       $   24,675    
 TOTAL     $   114,864       $   113,110    
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees.  The audit fees were billed for the audit by RSM of           our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or services that are normally provided by RSM in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.
Audit Related Fees.  The audit related fees were incurred for           SEC reporting matters and other audit related services. Tax Fees.  The tax fees were billed for services rendered by           RSM for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.  The nature of the services comprising the tax fees was for year-end tax preparation of the partnership return and associated K-1's.
Our Audit Committee has concluded that the provision of the non-audit services listed above is compatible with maintaining the independence of RSM.
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services
As set forth in the charter of the Audit Committee, it is the policy of the Company that all audit and non-audit engagements of RSM are pre-approved by           the Audit Committee.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the units represented in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting, assuming a quorum is present, is required           for the approval of the proposal.  Abstentions or proxies or ballots marked to "withhold authority" will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum             for the transaction of business but will not be counted as votes cast for or against Proposal 3.
OUR DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT MEMBERS VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF RSM US LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC           ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Members should be aware that under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the following report issued by the Audit Committee             relating to certain of its activities during Fiscal Year 2018 is not considered "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference in any past or future filing by             the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, unless specifically referenced.
Our directors have the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including the role of oversight of the management of the Company.  The           Audit Committee's general purpose is to assist our directors in fulfilling their responsibilities by overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company, the audits of our financial statements, the qualifications and           performance of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged as our independent auditor, and the performance of our internal accounting, financial reporting and auditing processes.
The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities.            Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Company's financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures           designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations.  Management is also responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of the Company's system of internal           control.  The Company's independent auditor, RSM, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally           accepted in the United States.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended September 30,           2018, and the independent auditor's report on those financial statements, with the Company's management and with RSM.  Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with           generally accepted accounting principles.
The Audit Committee has discussed with RSM the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The Audit Committee           has also received the written disclosures and the letter from RSM required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding RSM communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has           discussed with RSM that firm's independence.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the directors that the audited financial statements be included           in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. AUDIT COMMITTEE

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC require our directors, certain officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our           outstanding units to file reports of their ownership and changes in ownership of our units with the SEC. Company employees generally prepare these reports on behalf of our executive officers on the basis of information obtained from them and           review the forms submitted to us by our non-employee directors and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the units.  Based on such information, we believe that all reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be filed by our           directors, officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the units during or with respect to Fiscal Year 2018 were filed on time except that Mr. Taylor did not timely file a Form 4 relating to the purchase of units on June 30, 2018 but such           Form 4 was subsequently filed.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
In January 2018, our directors adopted a Related Party Policy which requires that the             Nominating and Company Corporate Governance Committee review the material facts of any related party transaction and approve or ratify such transaction.  The Related Party Policy also formalized certain practices and procedures           historically followed by our directors relating to the approval of any transaction, arrangement or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relations, including indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness, with related parties.  Related           persons include our directors or executive officers and their respective immediate family members and 5% beneficial owners of our units. Our Related Party Policy exempts any commodity market purchase or sale transactions from the definition of           "related party transaction" if such purchase or sale is at the then current market prices and therefore, such transactions do not require review or prior approval.  The Company did not have any related party transactions during Fiscal Year 2018.
MEMBER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF MEMBERS
We currently anticipate holding the 2020 annual meeting of members in February or March of 2020.  The Company is not required to consider any proposal or           director nomination petition that does not meet the requirements of the SEC and our Operating Agreement and therefore, any member who wishes to submit a proposal or director nomination petition is encouraged to seek independent counsel about the           requirements of the SEC and our Operating Agreement.
All proposals and nomination petitions should be directed to the Company's principal executive office located at 59511 W. Lincoln Highway, Nevada, Iowa,           50201, to the attention of the Company's Secretary.  We also recommend that proposals and director nomination petitions be sent by electronic means or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by another means that permits proof of the date           of delivery.
Member Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in the Company's 2020 Proxy Statement Under SEC Rules
Under applicable SEC rules, including Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, any member proposal to be considered by the Company for inclusion in the proxy           materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members must be received by the Secretary of the Company, at 59511 W. Lincoln Highway, Nevada, Iowa 50201, no later than one-hundred and twenty (120) days prior to when we mailed the proxy materials for           the preceding year's annual meeting.  Accordingly, we determined that members must submit proposals related to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members to the Company by September 27, 2019.  Proposals submitted later than September 27, 2019 will be           considered untimely and will not be included in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members.
In addition, all proposals will need to comply with Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which lists the requirements for inclusion of           member proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials.  Our directors will review proposals submitted by members for inclusion at our next annual meeting of members and will make recommendations to our directors on an appropriate response to such           proposals.  As the rules of the SEC make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee that it will be included in our proxy materials.
Requirements for Member Proposals to be Brought Before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members
Pursuant to Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, if the Company does not receive advance notice of a member proposal to be brought before its next           annual meeting of members in accordance with the requirements of its Operating Agreement or other governing documents, the proxies solicited by the Company may confer discretionary voting authority to vote proxies on the member proposal without           any discussion of the matter in the proxy statement. Section 5.4 of our Operating Agreement provides that written notice of a member proposal or other business a member intends to present at the next annual           meeting must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Company no later than one-hundred and twenty (120) days prior to when we mailed the proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting.  Members           must therefore submit notice of any member proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members to the Company by September 27, 2019.  Proposals submitted later than September 27, 2019 will be considered untimely and will not business that may           properly be brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members.
As to each matter the member proposes to bring before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members, the member's notice must set forth: (i) a description of the           proposal or business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (ii) the name and address, as they appear in the Company's books, of the member making the proposal; (iii)           the number of units beneficially owned by such member, the period of time the member has beneficially owned those units, and a statement that the member intends to continue to hold the units through the date of the annual meeting; (iv) any           material interest of the member in the proposal or business; and (v) all other information that would be required to be provided by the member pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act if the member has submitted the proposal pursuant to           Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.  The Company does not have any obligation to include any such proposal in the proxy statement, proxy or ballot or other proxy materials of the Company.  Our Operating Agreement also provides that the presiding           officer at an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting and, if he should so determine, such business shall not be transacted.
A copy of our Operating Agreement will be furnished to members without charge upon written request delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the           Company's principal executive office.
Director Nominations
Information regarding the process for members to make director nominee recommendations or director nominations for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Members is           set forth above under the section entitled "Directors and Corporate Governance – Director Nomination Process."
OTHER MATTERS
The directors do not intend to bring any other business before the 2019 Annual Meeting, and no member proposals will be able to be made or acted upon at           the 2019 Annual Meeting, so the only member actions to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting will be the vote on the three proposals as described and provided in this Proxy Statement.
