To Our Shareholders:
It is a great time to be part of Pro-Dex. Fiscal 2018 was an excellent year and we are positioned to further grow our business and share the Pro-Dex story. We remain fortunate to have a team of loyal and hard-working people who make things possible.
In 2018 Pro-Dex was named one of the fastest growing public companies in Orange County for the second consecutive year. We have completed our first Pro-Dex branded product that features our patented torque limiting technology and are pleased that we have signed a contract with a major Medical Device player as our first customer. Following that success, we have launched projects to develop two additional Pro-Dex products as we continue to expand our portfolio.
With our financial success we are able to continue to invest in our core medical device business, be it new products, equipment, people or technology. As momentum continues to build, your team here is excited to see the changes we have made and the developments to come. We value the people on this team, as evidenced by Pro-Dex being named as a Top Workplace in Orange County for the second year in a row.
We appreciate our shareholders as well. Thank you for your continued interest and support. I look forward to any questions or comments that you might have. You can reach the Board or myself at (949) 769-3200 or e mail us at investor.relations@pro-dex.com.

ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
TO BE HELD NOVEMBER 15, 2018

PROXY STATEMENT
———————————
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
The Board of Directors ("Board") of Pro-Dex, Inc. ("Pro-Dex", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") has made these materials available to you on the Internet, or, upon your request, has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the Board's solicitation of proxies for use at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual Meeting") to be held at Pro-Dex's headquarters, 2361 McGaw Avenue, Irvine, California, on Thursday, November 15, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof. Shareholders are requested to promptly vote by proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which was mailed to you on or about October 5, 2018. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you can also vote by mail or by telephone. All shares represented by each properly submitted and unrevoked proxy received on the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Wednesday, November 14, 2018, or by proxy card prior to or at the Annual Meeting, will be voted in the manner specified therein, and if no direction is indicated (except in the case of broker non-votes), "for" each of the five director nominees named under Proposal No. 1; and "for" each of Proposal Nos. 2 and 3. 
Any shareholder has the power to revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted. A proxy may be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary prior to or at the Annual Meeting, by voting again on the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Wednesday, November 14, 2018, will be counted), by submitting prior to or at the Annual Meeting a later dated proxy card executed by the person executing the prior proxy, or by attendance at the Annual Meeting and voting in person by the person submitting the prior proxy. 
Any shareholder who owns shares in street name and would like to vote in person at the Annual Meeting should inform his or her broker of such plans and request a legal proxy from the broker. Such shareholders will need to bring the legal proxy with them to the Annual Meeting and valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, in addition to documentation indicating share ownership. Such shareholders who do not receive the legal proxy in time should bring with them to the Annual Meeting their most recent brokerage account statement showing that they owned Pro-Dex stock as of the record date. Upon submission of proper identification and ownership documentation, we will be able to admit the shareholder to the Annual Meeting; however, such shareholder will not be able to vote his or her shares at the Annual Meeting without a legal proxy. Shareholders are advised that if they own shares in street name and request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked, and such shareholder's vote will not be counted unless he or she appears at the Annual Meeting and votes in person. 
Our Board does not presently intend to bring any business before the Annual Meeting other than the proposals referred to in this proxy statement and specified in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. So far as is known to our Board, no other matters are to be brought before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters are presented properly for action at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof, it is intended that the proxies will be voted with respect thereto by the proxy holders in accordance with the instructions and at the discretion of our Board or a properly authorized committee thereof. 
This proxy statement, the accompanying shareholder letter, the accompanying proxy card and our Annual Report on Form 10-K are being made available to our shareholders on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com through the notice and access process on or about October 5, 2018. We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies pursuant to this proxy statement. The solicitation will be made through the Internet and expenses will include reimbursement paid to brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material regarding the Annual Meeting to beneficial owners of our common stock, no par value per share ("Common Stock"). Further solicitation of proxies may be made by mail upon request, and by telephone or oral communications with some shareholders. Our regular employees, who will not receive additional compensation for the solicitation, or a compensated proxy solicitation firm, will make such further solicitations.
OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING RIGHTS
Only holders of record of the 4,269,940 shares of our Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on September 21, 2018, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Under Colorado law, our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws, the holders of a majority of the total shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, as of the record date, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting may be postponed or adjourned to allow additional time for obtaining additional proxies or votes. At any subsequent reconvening of the Annual Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Annual Meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the reconvening of the Annual Meeting. Shares of our Common Stock represented in person or by proxy (regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters), as well as abstentions and broker non-votes, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.
An "abstention" is the voluntary act of not voting by a shareholder who is represented in person or by proxy at a meeting and entitled to vote. "Broker non-votes" are shares of voting stock held in record name by brokers and nominees concerning which: (i) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power under applicable rules or the instruments under which it serves in such capacity and instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote; or (ii) the record holder has indicated on the proxy or has executed a proxy and otherwise notified us that it does not have authority to vote such shares on that matter.
For Proposal No. 1 (the election of directors), assuming that a quorum is present, the five nominees for director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected; votes withheld and broker non-votes have no practical effect. 
For Proposal No. 2 (to ratify the appointment of Moss Adams, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019) and Proposal No. 3 (advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers) assuming that a quorum is present, the matter will be approved if the votes cast in favor of the matter exceed the votes cast opposing the matter. In such matters, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be included in the vote totals and, therefore, will have no effect on the vote.
Each shareholder will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of Common Stock held of record on the record date. Votes cast at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the person or persons appointed by us to act as inspectors of election for the Annual Meeting.
Recommendations of our Board
Our Board recommends that our shareholders vote "for" each of the five director nominees named under Proposal No. 1; and "for" each of Proposal Nos. 2 and 3.
THE PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED UPON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO READ AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THIS PROXY STATEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY.

The Audit Committee also evaluates the independent public accounting firm's performance and appoints or replaces the independent public accounting firm subject, if applicable, to the consideration of shareholder ratification for the ensuing fiscal year. A copy of the Audit Committee's current charter may be found at http://www/pro-dex/com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Audit-Committee-Charter-282017-Updates-Final29-1.pdf. The Audit Committee and Board have confirmed that the Audit Committee does and will continue to include at least three independent directors and has confirmed that Messrs. Hovda, Cabillot and Swenson each meet applicable SEC regulations for designation as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert" based upon their respective experience noted elsewhere in this proxy statement. The Audit Committee held six meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and acted three times by unanimous written consent.
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee
Our Board has a Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee ("Nominating Committee") that consists of four Board members, Messrs. Cabillot (Chairman), Farrell, Hovda and Swenson. The Nominating Committee is comprised entirely of non-employee, "independent directors" (as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules) and operates under a written charter adopted by our Board, a copy of which may be found at http://www.pro-dex.com/media/23113/prodex_gov_committee_charter.pdf. In such capacity, the Nominating Committee identifies and reviews the qualifications of candidate nominees to our Board. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the full Board carried out the duties typically ascribed to the Nominating Committee. As such, the Nominating Committee held no separate meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
The Nominating Committee works with our Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experiences for our Board as a whole and its individual members with the objective of having a Board with diverse experience. The Nominating Committee believes that it is desirable that directors possess an understanding of our business environment and have the requisite ethical standards, knowledge, skills, expertise and diversity of experience such that our Board's ability to manage and direct our affairs and business is enhanced. Additional considerations may include an individual's capacity to enhance the ability of committees of our Board to fulfill their duties and/or satisfy any independence requirements imposed by law, regulation or listing requirements. The Nominating Committee may receive candidate nomination suggestions from current Board members, our executive officers, our shareholders or other sources, which may be either unsolicited or in response to requests from our Board for such candidates. The Nominating Committee may also, from time to time, engage firms that specialize in identifying director candidates. Once a person has been identified by the Nominating Committee as a potential candidate, the Nominating Committee may collect and review publicly available information regarding the person to assess whether the person should be considered further. If the Nominating Committee determines that the candidate warrants further consideration, a member of the Nominating Committee may contact the person. Generally, if the person expresses a willingness to be considered and to serve on our Board, the Nominating Committee may request information from the candidate, review the person's accomplishments and qualifications and may conduct one or more interviews with the candidate. The Nominating Committee may consider all such information in light of information regarding any other candidates that it might be evaluating for nomination to our Board. The Nominating Committee or other Board members may also contact one or more references provided by the candidate or may contact other members of the business community or other persons that may have greater first-hand knowledge of the candidate's qualifications and accomplishments. With the candidate's consent, the Nominating Committee may also engage an outside firm to conduct background checks on the candidate as part of the evaluation process. The Nominating Committee's evaluation process does not vary based on the source of the recommendation. 
-7-
Shareholder nominations for director should be sent to our Secretary and should include the candidate's name and qualifications and a statement from the candidate that he or she consents to being named in the proxy statement and will serve as a director if elected. In order for any such candidate to be considered for nomination and, if nominated, to be included in the proxy statement, such recommendation must satisfy the requirements discussed later in this proxy statement under the heading "Proposals of Shareholders."
In compiling the list of our Board nominees appearing in this proxy statement, nominee referrals as well as nominee recommendations were received from existing directors and members of management—both solicited and unsolicited. No paid consultants were engaged by us, our Board or any of our Board's committees for the purposes of identifying qualified, interested Board candidates.
Compensation Committee
Our Board has a Compensation Committee that consists of three Board members, Messrs. Swenson (Chairman), Cabillot and Farrell. The Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of non-employee, "independent directors" (as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules) and operates under a written charter adopted by our Board. A copy of the Compensation Committee's current charter may be found at http://www.pro-dex.com/media/23092/compensation_committee_charter.pdf. The Compensation Committee establishes compensation policies applicable to our executive officers and directors. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee held no meetings and acted six times by unanimous written consent.
From time to time, various members of management and other employees, as well as outside advisors or consultants, may be invited by the Compensation Committee to make presentations, provide financial or other background information or advice, or otherwise participate in Compensation Committee meetings or executive sessions of the Board. Among other things, the charter of the Compensation Committee grants the Compensation Committee authority to obtain, at our expense, advice and assistance from internal and external legal, accounting or other advisors and consultants and other external resources that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate in the performance of its duties. In particular, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain compensation consultants to assist in its evaluation of executive and director compensation, including the authority to approve the consultant's reasonable fees and other retention terms.
Investment Committee
The Investment Committee was formed in April 2013 and is currently comprised of one management director, Mr. Van Kirk, and two non-management directors, Mr. Cabillot and Mr. Swenson, who chairs the committee. The purpose of the Investment Committee is to administer and invest surplus capital from time to time, in such amounts as approved by the board, in authorized investments. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Investment Committee met twice and acted three times by unanimous written consent.
FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
There are no family relationships among our executive officers and directors.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Our Board has separated the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Swenson, an independent director, serves as Chairman of our Board and presides at all Board and shareholder meetings. Mr. Van Kirk, our Chief Executive Officer, serves as our primary spokesperson and supervises our business, subject to the direction of our Board. The independent Board members annually assess Mr. Van Kirk's performance as Chief Executive Officer. We believe that an independent Chairman of the Board is better able to provide oversight and guidance to management, especially in relation to the Board's essential role in risk management oversight, and to ensure the efficient use and accountability of resources. Furthermore, this separation provides for focused engagement between these two roles in their respective areas of responsibility, while still providing for collaborative participation. The separation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer roles, together with our other comprehensive corporate governance practices, are designed to establish and preserve management accountability, provide a structure that allows the Board to set objectives and monitor performance, and enhance shareholder value.

BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
Our Board has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of our risks. Our Board regularly reviews information regarding our credit, liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Audit Committee oversees management of financial risks. The Nominating Committee manages risks associated with the independence of our Board and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through committee and management reports about such risks and their mitigation. Our Board believes the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for evaluating and addressing the risks we face and that the structure allows our Board to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management.
COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MANAGEMENT
Compensation Committee Procedures
The Compensation Committee makes its most significant determinations with respect to annual compensation, bonus awards, and new financial and other corporate performance objectives for executive compensation purposes, at one or more meetings held during the fiscal year for which the targets and compensation levels are applicable. At various meetings throughout the year, the Compensation Committee also considers matters related to individual compensation, such as compensation for new executive hires, as well as high-level strategic issues, such as the efficacy of, and any risks relating to, our compensation strategies, policies and practices, potential modifications to those strategies, policies and practices, and new trends, plans or approaches to compensation.
Generally, the Compensation Committee's process consists of two related elements: (i) the determination of compensation levels and (ii) the approval of discretionary cash bonus awards based upon company and personal performance. For executive officers other than our CEO, the Compensation Committee solicits and considers evaluations and recommendations submitted to the Compensation Committee by our CEO. In the case of our CEO, the evaluation of his performance is conducted by the Compensation Committee, which determines any adjustments to his compensation. Our CEO may not participate in, or be present during, any deliberations or determinations of the Compensation Committee regarding his compensation. For all executive officers and directors, as part of its deliberations, the Compensation Committee may review and consider, as appropriate, materials such as financial reports and projections, operational data, tax and accounting information, tally sheets that set forth the total compensation that may become payable to executive officers in various hypothetical scenarios, our stock performance data, and analyses of historical executive compensation levels and our current compensation levels. Periodically, the Compensation Committee reviews all of our incentive compensation plans in order to evaluate the level of risk that such plans may encourage and, along with management's report concerning such matters and their mitigation, to ensure that each plan is properly monitored and evaluated. The specific determinations of the Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 are described herein.
Compensation Committee Philosophy
Our compensation philosophy is predicated upon the following concepts:
 We pay competitively. We are committed to providing a pay program that helps attract and retain highly qualified people in the industry. To ensure that pay is competitive, we compare our pay practices with those of other leading companies of similar size and location(s) and set our pay parameters based on this review.
 We pay for sustained performance. Executive officers are rewarded based upon corporate performance and individual performance. Corporate performance is evaluated by the Compensation Committee by reviewing the extent to which strategic and business plan goals are met, including such factors as revenues, operating profit and cash flow.
 We strive for fairness in the administration of pay and to achieve a balance of the compensation paid to a particular individual as compared to the compensation paid to both our executives and executives at comparable companies.
 We believe that employees should understand the performance evaluation and pay administration process.
-9-
The Compensation Committee believes that it is important that our executives be compensated in a manner that closely links compensation with performance and yet does not incent excessive risk-taking. To that end, the Compensation Committee has developed a comprehensive and balanced compensation plan that includes a base salary; discretionary bonuses upon evaluation of company and personal performance; and, a package of benefits similar in scope and nature to those offered to all our other employees. The Compensation Committee believes that equity-based incentives are an integral component of a competitive compensation plan. Accordingly, in September 2016, our Board approved the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan which shareholders approved on November 29, 2016. Additionally, in September 2014 our Board approved the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") which was approved by our shareholders in December 2014.
The Compensation Committee believes that there are no risks related to our compensation plans that would result in a material adverse impact on us. This conclusion is based upon management's risk analysis and the Compensation Committee's belief that the following mitigating factors also serve to reduce such risks:
 Incentives are capped at a maximum amount regardless of the degree to which objectives may be exceeded.
 Payments are based upon audited year end results.
 Multiple objectives are used as performance targets.
 Computations are reviewed at regular intervals during the year and are subject to multiple levels of review at the management, committee, and full Board level.

Our Board, as the administrator of each of the 2004 plans listed above, has the discretion to accelerate the vesting of any outstanding options held by the employees and directors in the event of an acquisition of us by a merger or asset sale in which the outstanding options under each such plan are not to be assumed by the successor corporation or substituted with options to purchase shares of such corporation.

Vesting of outstanding options held by members of our Board would be automatically accelerated as a result of a change of control.

2016 Equity Incentive Plan
Our Compensation Committee, as the administrator of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan listed above, has the discretion to accelerate the vesting of any outstanding options or Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") held by the employees, consultants and directors in the event of an acquisition of us by a merger or asset sale in which the outstanding options and SARs under the plan are not to be assumed by the successor corporation or substituted with options to purchase shares of such corporation.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee reports to and acts on behalf of our Board in providing oversight to our financial management, independent registered public accounting firm, and financial reporting procedures. Our management is responsible for preparing our financial statements and the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those statements. In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K with management and Moss Adams, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to audit such financial statements.
The Audit Committee has discussed with Moss Adams, LLP the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16 ("Communications with Audit Committees"). The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Moss Adams, LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence and has discussed with Moss Adams, LLP its independence. In concluding that Moss Adams, LLP is independent, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors, whether the non-audit services provided by Moss Adams, LLP were compatible with maintaining its independence.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and be filed with the SEC.
The Audit Committee has appointed Moss Adams, LLP to serve as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Our code of business conduct and ethics, as approved by our Board, can be obtained from http://www.pro-dex.com/media/23086/prodex_code_of_conduct.pdf.
We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K relating to amendments to or waivers from provisions of the code that relate to one of more of the items set forth in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K and its successor regulation, by describing on our Internet website, within four business days following the date of a waiver or a substantive amendment, the date of the waiver or amendment, the nature of the amendment or waiver, and the name of the person to whom the waiver was granted. There have been no waivers of the ethics policy granted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and through the date of this proxy statement, nor have there been any requests for such waivers during that period.
Information on our Internet site is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this proxy statement or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our directors and officers and any person who owns more than ten percent of our Common Stock are required to report their initial ownership of our Common Stock and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market. Officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all forms they file in accordance with Section 16(a). To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us or filed with the SEC and written representations that no other reports were required, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all Section 16(a) reports required to be filed by our officers directors and greater than 10% shareholders were properly and timely filed. 
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Our Board has the responsibility to review and discuss with management and approve, and has adopted written policies and procedures relating to approval or ratification of, interested transactions with related parties. During this process, the material facts as to the related party's interest in a transaction are disclosed to all Board members or an applicable committee. Under the policies and procedures, the Board is to review each interested transaction with a related party that requires approval and either approve or disapprove of the entry into the interested transaction. An "interested transaction" is any transaction in which we are a participant and any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest. Transactions that are in the ordinary course of business and would not require either disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act or approval of the Board or an independent committee of the Board pursuant to applicable Nasdaq rules would not be deemed interested transactions. No director may participate in any approval of an interested transaction with respect to which he or she is a related party. Our Board intends to approve only those related party transactions that are in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.
On September 20, 2017, we entered into a Participation Agreement with FS Special Opportunities I, L.P., a Minnesota limited partnership ("Principal"), pursuant to which we paid Principal $1,150,000 in cash to purchase a 50% undivided interest (the "Participation") in Principal's $2,300,000 loan (the "Loan") to 414 New York LLC, a New York limited liability company ("Borrower"). The Participation constitutes our purchase of a property interest in the Loan from Principal and does not create a creditor-debtor relationship between us and Borrower. Borrower used the proceeds from the Loan to acquire a leasehold interest in certain real estate operated as a hotel in the Borough of Manhattan, County, City and State of New York. Raymond E. Cabillot, a director of the Company, is the managing partner of Farnam Street Capital, Inc. ("Farnam") and Farnam is the founding partner of FS Special Opportunities I, L.P. Our Board, other than Mr. Cabillot, voted to approve the transaction.
We have invested in marketable equity securities at June 30, 2018 in the amount of $285,000 in the common stock of Air T, Inc. Two of our Board members are also board members of Air T, Inc. and both either individually or through affiliates own an equity interest in Air T, Inc. Our Chairman, one of the two Board members aforementioned, also serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Air T, Inc. The shares have been purchased through 10b5-1 Plans, which in accordance with our internal policies regarding the approval of related party transactions, was approved by our three Board members that are not affiliated with Air T, Inc.
-14-
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Colorado law.
Director Independence
Our corporate governance guidelines provide that a majority of the Board and all members of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees of the Board will be independent. On an annual basis, each director and executive officer is obligated to complete a Director and Officer Questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transactions with us in which a director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, have a direct or indirect material interest. Following completion of these questionnaires, the Board, with the assistance of the Nominating Committee, makes an annual determination as to the independence of each director using the current standards for "independence" established by the SEC and Nasdaq, additional criteria set forth in our corporate governance guidelines and consideration of any other material relationship a director may have with us.
The Board has determined that all of its directors are independent under these standards, except for Mr. Van Kirk, our Chief Executive Officer and President.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS
Our Board has established a process to receive communications from shareholders. Shareholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of our Board, or the independent directors as a group, any Board committee or any Chair of any such committee by mail or electronically. To communicate with our Board, any individual directors or any group or committee of directors, correspondence should be addressed to our Board or any such individual directors or group or committee of directors by either name or title. All such correspondence should be sent "c/o Corporate Secretary" at 2361 McGaw Avenue, Irvine, California 92614. To communicate with any of our directors electronically, a shareholder should send an email to our Secretary: alisha.charlton@pro-dex.com.
All communications received as set forth in the preceding paragraph will be opened by the Company's Secretary for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to one or more of the directors. Any contents that are not in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service or patently offensive material will be forwarded promptly to the addressee. In the case of communications to the Board or any group or committee of directors, the Company's Secretary will make sufficient copies (or forward such information in the case of e-mail) of the contents to send to each director who is a member of the group or committee to which the envelope or e-mail is addressed.
It is our policy that our directors are invited and encouraged to attend all of our annual meetings of shareholders. All of our directors were in attendance at the 2017 Annual Meeting.

Proposal No. 2
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of Moss Adams, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and requests our shareholders to ratify this appointment. In the event that our shareholders do not ratify the selection of Moss Adams, LLP as our independent public accountants, our Board will consider the selection of another independent public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders.
A representative of Moss Adams, LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. He or she will have the opportunity to make a statement if such representative desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
ACCOUNTING FEES
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit. The Audit Committee considers whether the performance of any service by our independent registered public accounting firm is compatible with maintaining such firm's independence.
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 to our independent registered public accounting firm, Moss Adam, LLP, all of which were preapproved by the Audit Committee.

Proposal No. 3
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our shareholders to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, commonly referred to as the "say-on-pay" vote. In accordance with the Exchange Act requirements, we are providing our shareholders with an opportunity to express their views on our Named Executive Officers' compensation. Although this advisory vote is nonbinding, our Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our Named Executive Officer compensation and related executive compensation programs.
We encourage shareholders to read the "Compensation of Executive Officers and Management" section in this proxy statement, including the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure, which describes the structure and amounts of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The compensation of our Named Executive Officers is designed to enable us to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead us successfully in a competitive environment. The Compensation Committee and our Board believe that our executive compensation strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our Named Executive Officers to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders.
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables and any other related disclosure in the proxy statement."
Required Vote and Board Recommendation
Assuming a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, this proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers will be approved if the votes cast in favor of this proposal exceed the votes cast opposing this proposal.
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT OUR SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR", ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
