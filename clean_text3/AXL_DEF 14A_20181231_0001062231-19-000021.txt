ESG is a journey, and we will continue to build upon our foundational programs as we move forward.

Dear Fellow Shareholders:
AAM is committed to engaging in constructive and meaningful communications with our shareholders. Our Board and management team greatly value the opinions and feedback of our shareholders, which is why we have proactive, ongoing engagement throughout the year focused on corporate governance, corporate responsibility and executive compensation.
The Board was pleased with the favorable outcome of the vote on our say-on-pay proposal in 2018 (97% as compared to 38% in 2017), which we believe reflects the Board's responsiveness to shareholder feedback relating to executive compensation. Our engagement meetings this year covered a wide range of topics, including board refreshment and diversity, environmental, social and governance topics and incentive compensation metrics/goal rigor. The Board was actively involved in the process and thoughtfully considered the feedback we heard from you. As a result, we took several important actions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
– Enhanced the experience, leadership and diversity of our Board with the appointments of Herbert K. Parker and Sandra E. Pierce in November 2018. These appointments were the result of active recruitment of women and minority candidates. 
– Formalized our commitment to Board diversity by adopting a policy that requires director searches to include qualified women and minorities in future candidate pools for nomination to our Board.  
– Adopted proxy access by-laws. 
– Strengthened the governance of our sustainability program by assigning oversight responsibility to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee by amending its charter. This level of oversight reflects the importance of our sustainability program to AAM's overall business strategy.  
– Continued to align the metrics and rigor of our incentive plans to drive achievement of AAM's business strategy. 
[END TABLE]
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our sincere appreciation for the trust you have placed in us. Know that your Board remains focused on delivering value to you, today and long into the future. 
Thank you for investing in AAM.

Environmental, Social and Governance Initiatives
At AAM, corporate responsibility is an integral part of our business strategy. Since our inception, AAM has believed being focused on sustainability is beneficial to our shareholders, associates, suppliers, customers, communities and the environment. With our cultural values and strategic principles as a foundation, AAM associates are empowered to act according to the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and with respect for the cultures in which we do business, while serving local communities and having a positive impact on the environment. 
AAM's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) program is fundamental to our global business operations and is aligned with our strategic objectives. ESG is a journey, and we will continue to build upon our foundational programs as we move forward. We also communicate with our shareholders about ESG topics and solicit their feedback. In response to shareholder feedback and to make continuous improvement, we strengthened the governance of our sustainability program with board-level oversight and with AAM leadership focused on ESG performance as a top company goal for 2019. Some of our key ESG initiatives are summarized below.
Environmental Stewardship
AAM is dedicated to the protection and conservation of the environment. We are helping to ensure a green future through product innovation, social responsibility, global compliance, and the reduction of energy use, waste and pollution.
[BEGIN TABLE]
– Technology Leadership: AAM contributes to a better global environment through the development of innovative mobility solutions that improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2  emissions. We have made significant investments in research and development to develop and advance products that reduce mass, increase efficiency, lower emissions and advance electrification. These technologies will help automakers meet global environmental emissions regulations while also increasing fuel efficiency.  
– Global Environmental Policy: AAM's global operations are aligned to support our commitment to the environment. About 90% of all of our products are manufactured in facilities that are certified to ISO 14001-2015. During the last three years, we have more than tripled the number of manufacturing facilities that have earned the ISO 50001 Energy Management certification. We will continue to add more locations to the list of certified facilities and deploy best practices throughout our global operations. 
[END TABLE]
Social Responsibility
[BEGIN TABLE]
– People-First Culture: We are focused on recruiting, developing and retaining the best and brightest talent globally. We provide our global associates with the tools to develop technically and grow professionally into the leaders that will guide AAM into the future. We strive to ensure inclusive hiring processes and work environments and support diversity and inclusion initiatives of our associates. Our human rights policy is designed to support universal human rights and the dignity of our associates and people in our communities and global supply chain.  
– Safety Focus: Our most valuable asset is our global team of associates and we work hard each day to keep them safe at each of our facilities. With safety as a top priority, we designed and implemented our S4 system and safety culture, which is focused on developing, engaging, monitoring and continuously educating our associates on standardized procedures that keep them safe. Every AAM location uses the S4 system.  
– Community Involvement: AAM and our associates have a long tradition of supporting the communities in which we live and work. We continued to have a positive impact during 2018 through a wide variety of corporate initiatives and individual activities. 
– AAM committed significant resources to revitalize key Detroit neighborhoods near AAM's world headquarters as part of the City of Detroit Strategic Neighborhood Fund. Contributions from AAM and other Detroit organizations will be used to bring much-needed physical improvements to neighboring communities. Our associates will have the opportunity to participate in volunteer activities and make a difference in these vibrant but under-served neighborhoods.  
– In Mexico, the Richard E. Dauch Education and Development Institute opened next to AAM's Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex. A joint initiative between AAM and the local government, the Institute will train current and future AAM associates with the latest technology and manufacturing

[BEGIN TABLE]
– Sustainability Working Group: In 2018, our corporate Policy Committee, which is chaired by the CEO, established a Sustainability Working Group to focus on and achieve objectives related to our sustainability program. The Sustainability Working Group is led by AAM's President (Environmental Factors), Vice President, Human Resources (Social Factors) and Vice President & General Counsel (Governance Factors) and is supported by cross-functional teams of subject matter experts and leaders.  
– Board and Committee Oversight: In 2019, the Charter of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee was expanded to include oversight of our sustainability policies, programs and reporting. This level of oversight reflects the importance of our sustainability program to AAM's long-term business strategy and objectives.

The foundation of our compensation philosophy is a best practice approach to compensation governance that includes a clawback policy, an anti-hedging policy, an annual risk assessment of compensation programs and practices, double-trigger equity vesting and severance provisions, and the exclusion of excise tax gross-ups.
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
[BEGIN TABLE]
– AAM's 2018 say-on-pay proposal received a favorable vote of 97% of votes cast. To gain this level of support, we engaged with our shareholders and implemented changes in response to their feedback. 
– We increased the rigor of our annual and long-term incentive compensation targets for awards granted in 2018 and continued this practice to drive management performance at the highest levels. 
– In April 2018, AAM amended the legacy Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to freeze further benefit accruals and new participation in the plans. Based on a benchmark analysis of executive retirement plan benefits, we adopted the Executive Retirement Savings Plan, a deferred compensation plan that reduces executive retirement benefits, provides cost savings to the Company as compared to the SERP, and further aligns our programs with prevailing market practices. 
– In April 2018, AAM adopted the Executive Officer Severance Plan in order to provide severance other than in a change in control to executive officers with the purpose of retaining our executives and allowing them to focus on our business strategy. In addition, AAM amended its employment agreements with Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte to align severance payable under their employment agreements with the Severance Plan.

Pay for Performance Alignment
Our compensation programs are designed to balance short-term performance with long-term growth. To align executive pay with AAM's performance, a significant amount of our CEO's and other NEOs' compensation is performance based and is at risk.

Goal Rigor
The Committee annually reviews performance metrics, targets and payouts to ensure that they are challenging stretch goals designed to align with our strategy and long-range plan and also to mitigate risk. The 2018 annual and long-term incentive metrics were designed to reward growth and sustain profitability. 
In addition, the 2018 incentive metrics were modified to drive significant focus on EBITDA for the short-term metric and free cash flow and relative TSR, weighted equally, for the long-term metrics.
2018 Annual Incentive Compensation  
The Committee selected adjusted EBITDA as the sole metric for the 2018 annual incentive award to drive significant focus on this metric. Superior EBITDA performance is critical to our strategy of generating cash, reducing leverage and providing funding for organic and strategic growth. The performance levels for 2018 annual incentive awards reflect stretch goals that are designed to reward growth and sustain profitability as shown below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
– Target performance was set at a level significantly higher than 2017 actual adjusted EBITDA performance. 
– Achievement of target performance would result in the highest adjusted EBITDA performance in AAM history. 
– Target performance is higher than the performance of a majority of our peer group companies. 
[END TABLE]
Although 2018 actual adjusted EBITDA performance was a record-setting achievement for AAM, the pre-established performance target was not achieved. As a result of this goal rigor, our NEOs received a below-target payout. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Based on feedback from shareholders and alignment with our strategy, the Committee also modified the 2018 LTI performance metrics to include free cash flow and relative TSR, weighted equally. The performance levels set for 2018 required our management team to continue to perform at a high level, achieve integration synergies, implement productivity improvements, successfully launch new product programs and create long-term value. The Committee increased the rigor of the threshold, target and maximum performance levels as shown below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
– Free cash flow target performance for 2018 - 2020 was set at a level higher than the previous three years' performance. 
– Achievement of target performance would result in the highest free cash flow in AAM history. 
– Relative TSR payout is capped if absolute TSR is negative.

2016 - 2018 Performance Share Awards
Payouts under the LTI performance share awards granted in 2016 were based on two equally weighted, three-year performance metrics – adjusted relative TSR and EBITDA margin. Awards based on relative TSR resulted in a zero payout to senior management because the threshold performance level was not achieved. This result reflects the Compensation Committee's commitment to align LTI pay with the interest of our shareholders through rigorous goal-setting. Our shareholders did not realize value on our stock over this time period. Consequently, and by design, our senior management team received no value from these awards.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Governance Point     
Payout capped if 3-year absolute TSR is negative.     
[END TABLE]
The performance targets for the EBITDA performance share awards were determined in consideration of AAM's historical EBITDA margins for 2013 - 2015 as noted below. The maximum performance level was set to drive performance significantly above our peers and encourage EBITDA margin growth. Over this period, management delivered a result well in excess of targets and prior actual performance, which supported an above-target payout. This outstanding financial performance allowed us to reduce debt and position AAM for strategic actions.

Active Engagement with our Shareholders 
Our Board and management team greatly value the opinions and feedback of our shareholders, which is why we have proactive, ongoing engagement with our shareholders throughout the year focused on corporate governance, executive compensation and corporate responsibility. This outreach is in addition to the ongoing communication between our shareholders and our Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations team on AAM's financial performance and strategic objectives.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Why we engage 
Provide transparency into our business strategy, corporate governance practices and executive compensation programs Determine which issues are important to our shareholders and communicate each others' views on those topics Identify emerging issues that may impact our business and influence our practices

How we engage 
Investor  Communication Program   We provide institutional investors with many opportunities to provide feedback to senior management by participating in conferences, one-on-one and group meetings, investor visits to our manufacturing facilities and technical centers, and day-to-day interactions with individual investors throughout the year.    In June 2018, AAM hosted an Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange where our CEO and senior management gave an update on our business and strategic plans.

Proactive Shareholder Outreach Program   As part of our annual shareholder outreach program, we also engage with shareholders in conference calls or meetings outside the proxy season. These exchanges, which we initiate, cover our executive compensation program, risk management, ESG, strategic planning and corporate governance practices. Soliciting shareholder feedback is a key component of this program, which we do at least annually. As appropriate, we also engage with shareholders during proxy season.    Our Board members, CFO and Investor Relations Director participate in these outreach meetings.    Our shareholder outreach activities during 2018 - 2019 are described in the Proxy Summary and the Compensation Discussion & Analysis.

Our CFO conveys shareholders' feedback to the full Board and the Compensation Committee or Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee, depending on the subject of the feedback. The Board also receives any feedback we obtain from proxy advisory firms, such as ISS and Glass Lewis, as part of our outreach program.    The Board gives management feedback on key aspects of AAM's investor relations communication plan and shareholder outreach program.

The Board has adopted Director Independence Guidelines to assist in determining the independence of our directors under the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Director Independence Guidelines are included in AAM's Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on our website at http://investor.aam.com. The Board annually reviews and determines, on the recommendation of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, whether any director has a material relationship with the Company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. No director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Company.
In February 2019, the Board reviewed the independence of each then-sitting director, applying the independence standards set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Based on these independence standards and the relevant facts and circumstances, the Board determined that no director other than Mr. Dauch, our CEO, has a material relationship with AAM and that each director other that Mr. Dauch is independent. Mr. Dauch is not independent because of his employment with AAM. 
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board consists of a combined Chairman and CEO role, complemented with a Lead Independent Director chosen from our independent directors. This structure, along with our sound governance practices, provides effective and independent oversight of the Company.
The Chairman and CEO role brings to the Board the experience and expertise of both the Company and the automotive industry. The skills and experience of our CEO are well-suited for the role of Chairman, putting the Board in the best position to identify and assess key industry drivers and important changes in the competitive landscape so that the Board can develop effective strategies. In light of the opportunities and challenges facing  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Table of Contents Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
AAM and the importance of the Chairman role, the Board believes that shareholders are best served by having Mr. Dauch serve in the combined role of Chairman and CEO. 
While our independent directors bring diverse experiences and expertise from various perspectives outside AAM, Mr. Dauch's in-depth knowledge of our business enables him to identify important areas of focus for the Board and effectively recommend appropriate agendas. The combined role of Chairman and CEO facilitates information flow between management and the Board, provides clear accountability and promotes efficient decision making, all of which are essential to effective governance. 
Lead Independent Director
Our Board leadership structure is further enhanced by a Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director plays an important role in our governance structure, working with both the independent directors and the CEO to ensure the Company is well positioned with sound strategy, robust risk management and effective governance. The Lead Independent Director's key responsibilities are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– preside at executive sessions of independent directors; 
– call special executive sessions of independent directors, as appropriate; 
– serve as liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman & CEO; 
– inform the Chairman & CEO of issues arising from executive sessions of the independent directors; and 
– with Board approval, retain outside advisors who report to the full Board on matters of interest to the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Valenti currently serves as Lead Independent Director.
Board Meetings
Under AAM's by-laws, regular meetings of the Board are held at least quarterly. Our practice is to schedule certain Board meetings at an AAM manufacturing or technical center so our directors have an opportunity to observe different aspects of our business first-hand. During 2018, the Board held four regularly scheduled meetings. 
Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings, meetings of committees on which they serve, and the annual meeting of stockholders. Directors are expected to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. All continuing directors attended 100% of the Board and applicable committee meetings during 2018, except one director missed one Board meeting and another missed two committee meetings that were held on the same day. Overall attendance at Board and committee meetings was 97%. All directors then in office attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. No director attended less than 88% of Board and committee meetings on which he or she served in 2018.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated some of its authority to five committees: the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and the Technology Committee. Each of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees has adopted a charter that complies with current NYSE rules relating to corporate governance. Copies of these committee charters are available at http://investor.aam.com.
The Board approved the rotation of certain directors' committee memberships effective January 2019. The Board believes that periodic rotation of committee membership is generally desirable to ensure that committees regularly benefit from diverse views. 
With respect to the Audit Committee, the Board appointed Mr. Parker and Ms. Pierce as new members based on each of their professional experience and expertise. Based on Mr. Parker's prior experience as a chief financial officer, the Board determined that Mr. Parker is a financial expert according to SEC rules. In addition, the Board  considered Mr. Parker's concurrent service on the audit committees of three other public companies since his retirement from Harman International Industries, Inc. in March 2017. The Board concluded that, as a retiree, Mr. Parker's simultaneous service on the other audit committees would not impair his ability to effectively serve on AAM's Audit Committee. Mr. Parker has adequate time to fulfill his responsibilities as a member of the Audit Committee and our Board. 
Committee membership as of March 21, 2019, the number of meetings held during 2018, and each committee's primary responsibilities are summarized below. Every committee other than the Executive Committee regularly reports on its activities to the full Board.

Board Oversight of Risk Management
The Board believes that strong and effective internal controls and risk management processes are essential for achieving shareholder value. The Board has oversight for risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company, including strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks. The Board's risk oversight process builds upon management's risk assessment and mitigation processes, which include an enterprise risk management program, regular internal management disclosure and compliance committee meetings, a global ethics and compliance program and comprehensive internal audit processes. 
The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a full Board and through delegation to Board committees, which regularly report to the full Board. The Board has delegated the oversight of specific risks to Board committees that align with their functional responsibilities, as summarized in the table below.

Our Board believes that the most effective oversight comes from a Board that represents a diverse range of experience and perspectives that provide the collective skills, qualifications and attributes necessary to provide sound governance. To carry out its responsibilities and set the appropriate tone at the top, our Board is focused on the character, integrity and qualifications of its members, and on the Board's leadership structure and composition. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews with the Board the experience and attributes desired for effective governance in our changing industry and evaluates the current Board composition in light of these criteria. Although specific qualifications may vary from time to time, desired qualities and characteristics include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– high ethical character and shared values with AAM; 
– high-level leadership experience and achievement at a policy-making level in business, educational or professional activities; 
– breadth of knowledge of issues affecting AAM; 
– special competencies, such as financial, technical, international business or other expertise, or industry knowledge; 
– awareness of a director's vital role in AAM's good corporate citizenship and corporate image; and 
– sufficient time and availability to effectively carry out a director's duties.  
[END TABLE]
The Board as a whole should reflect a balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity that, when taken together, will enhance the quality of the Board's deliberations and decisions. 
The Board believes that diversity is an essential element of Board effectiveness. Consistent with this philosophy, the Board is committed to including in each search qualified candidates who reflect diverse backgrounds, including  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Table of Contents Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
diversity of gender and race. The Board formalized this commitment to diversity by amending its Corporate Governance Guidelines in February 2019.
Based on shareholder feedback and the Board's focus on Board diversity and refreshment, the Board enhanced the experience, leadership and diversity of the Board with the appointments of Herbert K. Parker and Sandra E. Pierce in November 2018. These appointments were the result of active recruitment of women and minority candidates. Ms. Pierce was identified as a candidate by Mr. Dauch and Mr. Parker was identified by another Board member.
In addition, for incumbent directors, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board consider attendance, past performance on the Board and contributions to the Board and applicable committees. These factors also were taken into consideration in nominating Ms. Chappell, Mr. Parker and Mr. Smith for re-election as Class II directors, each with a term expiring on the date of the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Our current Board, comprised of 10 directors, reflects the Board's commitment to identify, evaluate and nominate candidates who possess personal qualities, qualifications, skills, and diversity of backgrounds, and provide a mix of tenures that, when taken together, best serve our company and our shareholders. Diversity in tenure creates a good mix of perspectives. Longer-tenured directors bring a deep understanding of the Company and continuity as new directors join the Board. Newer members bring new perspectives, expertise and diversity as the Board is refreshed to address changes in the business over time. 
The current mix of top skills and qualifications of our Board members and key features of the Board's composition are depicted below.

Annual Equity Grant
Non-employee directors serving on the Board on the date of the 2018 annual meeting received a grant of 8,711 restricted stock units (RSUs) with a grant date value of $125,000. The RSUs are payable in stock and vest in one year, unless vesting is accelerated upon death, disability or a change in control. Non-employee directors may elect to defer settlement of the RSUs until after termination of service from the Board.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our non-employee director stock ownership guidelines provide that each non-employee director should own shares with a value equal to at least five times the director annual cash retainer. Non-employee directors are expected to meet the guidelines within five years from the date of election to the Board or February 2017, whichever is later. For purposes of meeting these guidelines, shares owned directly, deferred RSUs and unvested RSUs are counted. Each non-employee director has met, or is on track to meet, these ownership guidelines. Current stock ownership of non-employee directors is shown in the Beneficial Stock Ownership table. 
Anti-hedging and Anti-pledging policy
Non-employee directors are prohibited from entering into transactions that may result in a financial benefit if our stock price declines, or any hedging transaction involving our stock, including the use of financial derivatives, short sales or any similar transactions.

Related Person Transactions Policy 
[END TABLE]
The Board has adopted a written policy and procedure for the review, approval and ratification of transactions involving AAM and any "related person" as defined in the policy. This policy supplements AAM's other conflict of interest policies in our Code of Business Conduct. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing, approving and ratifying all related person transactions.
For purposes of this policy, a related person transaction includes any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which AAM is or is expected to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related person has or will have a material interest. A related person includes directors and executive officers and their immediate family members, stockholders owning more than five percent of the Company's outstanding common stock as of the last completed fiscal year, and any entity owned or controlled by any one of these persons.
The Audit Committee makes a determination whether a related person's interest in a transaction is material based on a review of the facts and circumstances. In deciding whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, (1) whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and (2) the significance of the related person's interest in the transaction.  
A member of the Audit Committee may not participate in the review or vote concerning any related person transaction in which the Audit Committee member or his or her immediate family member is involved. 
The policy also provides that certain types of transactions are deemed to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee and do not require separate approval or ratification. During fiscal year 2018 and as of the date of this proxy statement, the Company has not engaged in any reportable related person transactions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
[END TABLE]
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock. Based solely on our review of these reports, and written representations from such reporting persons, we believe that the Section 16(a) filing requirements for such reporting persons were met during 2018.

Proposal 2: Advisory vote on Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
AAM is seeking a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) and narrative and tabular disclosures in this proxy statement. In the CD&A, we provide a detailed description of our compensation programs, including our compensation philosophy and objectives, the individual elements of executive pay, and how the programs are administered. We encourage you to review the CD&A, together with the other narrative and tabular disclosures, in considering your advisory vote on our named executive officers' compensation (say-on-pay).
Pay for Performance Philosophy
AAM is committed to a compensation philosophy that supports our business strategy and performance, aligns with stockholder interests, and pays competitively. Our compensation programs are designed to balance short-term performance with long-term growth. To align executive pay with AAM's performance, a significant amount of our CEO's and other NEOs' compensation is performance based and is at risk.
Our incentive programs utilize both short- and long-term financial metrics that correlate to our strategic business objectives. The Compensation Committee annually reviews performance metrics, targets and payouts to ensure that they are challenging stretch goals designed to mitigate risk and align with our budget and long-range planning performance.
Shareholder Engagement
Our Board and management team greatly value the opinions and feedback of our shareholders, which is why we have proactive, ongoing engagement with our shareholders throughout the year focused on corporate governance, executive compensation and corporate responsibility. Most recently, our shareholders expressed support of our overall executive compensation program. 
2018 Changes to Executive Compensation Programs
To further align our compensation programs with our business strategy and market practices, we continued to refine our programs by taking the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– We increased the rigor of our annual and long-term compensation targets for awards granted in 2018 and continued this practice to drive management performance at the highest levels. 
– We amended the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to freeze further benefit accruals and freeze the plans to new participants. 
– We adopted a deferred compensation plan, the Executive Retirement Savings Plan which reduces executive retirement benefits as compared to that of the legacy SERP, a defined benefit plan. 
[END TABLE]
Although your vote on this proposal is advisory and non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will continue to carefully consider the voting results when making future compensation decisions.

Compensation Program Metrics Link to Strategic Business Objectives
The Committee utilizes both short- and long-term financial metrics relative to our business objectives, as well as relative total shareholder return (TSR) as a long-term incentive (LTI) metric. The following chart demonstrates how our incentive compensation metrics correlate to our strategic business objectives.
[BEGIN TABLE]

Goal Rigor
The Committee annually reviews performance metrics, targets and payouts to ensure that they are challenging, stretch goals that are aligned with our strategy and long-range plan and are also designed to mitigate risk. 
The incentive metrics selected by the Committee in 2018 focused on the importance of EBITDA performance for the annual incentive and free cash flow and relative TSR, weighted equally, for the LTI awards. 
Significantly, the Committee increased the rigor of our annual and long-term compensation targets for awards granted in 2018. The impact of this goal rigor is reflected in the 2018 annual incentive award payout. Although AAM achieved record-setting adjusted EBITDA performance in 2018, our NEOs received a below-target payout based on the stretch goals set by the Committee.

AAM is committed to engaging in constructive and meaningful communications with our shareholders. We received a favorable vote of 97% for our say-on-pay proposal in 2018. We believe this outcome reflects our responsiveness to shareholder feedback relating to executive compensation. More recently, our shareholders continued to express support of our overall executive compensation program and the alignment of our incentive compensation goals with the Company's overall business strategy. In consideration of the feedback we continued to receive from our shareholders and prevailing market practices among our peers, we continued to refine our programs.
[BEGIN TABLE]
– We increased the rigor of our annual and LTI compensation targets for awards granted in 2018 and continued this practice to drive management performance at the highest levels.

– In April 2018, AAM amended the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to freeze further benefit accruals and freeze the plans to new participants. At the same time, and to further align our benefit programs with prevailing market practices, AAM adopted the Executive Retirement Savings Plan (ERSP) to become effective January 1, 2019. The ERSP, a deferred compensation plan, reduces executive retirement benefits and provides cost savings to the Company as compared to the legacy SERP, a defined benefit plan.  
– In April 2018, AAM adopted the Executive Officer Severance Plan (Severance Plan) in order to provide severance other than in a change in control to executive officers with the purpose of retaining our executives and allowing them to focus on our business strategy. In addition, AAM amended its employment agreements with Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte to align severance payable under their employment agreements with the Severance Plan.

Pay for Performance Alignment
Total direct compensation consists of base salary plus target annual and long-term incentive compensation. Total direct compensation for each NEO may be above or below the 50th percentile of our comparative peer group based on various factors, including an individual's level of responsibility, demonstrated skills and experience, significance of position, contribution to Company performance, time in position, potential for advancement and internal pay equity considerations. The Committee generally sets performance objectives for annual and long-term incentive compensation so that targeted total direct compensation levels can be achieved only when target performance objectives are met. Consequently, actual pay may vary from targeted levels based on achieved performance against pre-established performance objectives. 
The following chart illustrates the allocation of 2018 total direct compensation components at target for our CEO and for our other NEOs (average) as a group as of December 31, 2018. This analysis highlights the Company's emphasis on long-term and at-risk compensation.

Decision-Making Process
Comprised solely of independent, non-employee directors, the Compensation Committee oversees the compensation and benefits programs for our executive officers, including the NEOs. In its oversight of our 2018 executive compensation program, the Committee worked with its independent compensation consultant, and with the CEO, the President, the CFO, and the Vice President, Human Resources. The CEO and the other officers provided information and recommendations with respect to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– Company performance objectives and goals, which serve as a basis for incentive compensation; 
– attracting, retaining and motivating executive officers; 
– information regarding financial performance, budgets and forecasts as they pertain to compensation; and 
– industry and market conditions affecting AAM's business strategy.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the recommendation of the Committee, the Board exercises its judgment to approve the compensation for the CEO. For all other executive officers, the Committee considers the CEO's recommendation for setting compensation levels. The compensation approved for the CEO and other executives is aligned with the Company's overall compensation philosophy. For 2018, the Committee made pay decisions based on a market analysis, Company performance and specific factors about each NEO, including individual performance, experience, internal equity, scope and responsibility of position, retention and other factors described in more detail below. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant
The Committee has retained Meridian Compensation Partners LLC (Meridian) as its independent compensation consultant. Meridian provides the Committee with independent advice and ongoing recommendations on compensation matters related to our executive officers and non-employee directors. Meridian provides the Committee with competitive market data, peer group analyses and updates on compensation trends and regulatory developments. Meridian also worked with the Company in evaluating its incentive programs and the selection of performance measures in response to shareholder feedback.
In the course of fulfilling its responsibilities, Meridian frequently communicates with the Chair of the Committee both prior to and following Committee meetings. Meridian also meets with management to gather information, prepare materials and review proposals to be made to the Committee. Meridian provides no other services to the Company and has no other direct or indirect business relationships with AAM or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Based on information provided by Meridian, the Committee assessed Meridian's independence pursuant to NYSE and SEC rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that prevents Meridian from independently advising the Committee.

Peer Group and Market Analysis
The Committee annually reviews the composition of our comparative peer group and makes adjustments to reflect changes in our business, as well as industry and market conditions. The overall purpose of this peer group is to provide a market frame of reference for evaluating our compensation arrangements, understanding compensation trends among comparable companies and reviewing other compensation and governance-related topics. The companies are selected primarily based on the following criteria:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– total revenue and market capitalization; 
– competitors in industry segment; 
– complexity of global business and operations; and 
– competition for talent and investor capital.

Base Salary
In determining salary levels for each of our NEOs, the Committee considers factors such as financial and operational performance, leadership, development, time in position, internal equity and potential. The Committee also considers each NEO's current base salary as compared to the salary range and median salary practices of our peer group.

[END TABLE]
The Committee determined that base salaries for the CEO and the NEOs (other than Mr. Willemse) will also remain unchanged for 2019. The Committee decided to increase Mr. Willemse's 2019 base salary to $575,000 effective January 16, 2019 in consideration of  the growth of the Metal Forming business unit as a result of the realignment of the Company's business units. The Summary Compensation Table shows the base salary earned in 2018 for each NEO.
Incentive Compensation
Annual Incentive Compensation
Each NEO's annual incentive compensation is based on achieved results against financial targets approved by the Committee under the AAM Incentive Compensation Program for Executive Officers. Payment of annual cash incentive awards is permitted to the extent the Company meets or exceeds threshold performance levels.
During shareholder outreach, shareholders expressed support of the Committee's efforts to align performance measures with our business strategy. The Committee considered this feedback in selecting absolute EBITDA dollars as the sole metric for determining 2018 annual incentive payouts. Strong EBITDA performance positions AAM to generate cash, reduce debt and provide funding for profitable growth and other capital priorities. The selection of EBITDA dollars as the sole performance measure emphasizes its importance to our business strategy. 
The Committee set the 2018 annual incentive EBITDA target at a level that drives management to continue to perform at a high level, achieve integration synergies, implement productivity improvements and successfully launch new product programs. Recognizing the importance of strong EBITDA performance, the Committee increased the rigor of the threshold, target and maximum performance levels. The performance levels for 2018 annual incentive awards reflect stretch goals that are designed to reward growth and sustain profitability.
[BEGIN TABLE]
– 2018 target performance was set at a level significantly higher than 2017 actual adjusted EBITDA performance. 
– Achievement of target performance would result in the highest adjusted EBITDA performance in AAM history. 
– Target performance is higher than the performance of a majority of our competitor peer group companies.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Our LTI program for executive officers is designed to reward NEOs for creating sustained shareholder value, to encourage ownership of Company stock, and to retain and motivate executives while aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. AAM generally makes equity grants to its executive officers and other executives on an annual basis, subject to the approval of the Committee. Grants are typically made in the first quarter of each year to coincide with the communication to executive officers of their annual cash incentive awards for the previous year's performance. This timing increases the impact of the awards by strengthening the link between pay and performance.

Our competitor peer group is used to assess relative performance for establishing long-term incentive award performance levels. The competitor peer group consists of companies that compete with AAM for capital and operate in similar markets. This group of companies serves as an appropriate benchmark for long-term incentives because of the likelihood that these companies will experience similar business conditions over a three-year cycle.
The Committee evaluated the performance measures for 2018 LTI performance share awards to ensure that the measures are aligned with our business strategy. A key objective of the Company is to strengthen our balance sheet and continue to provide for profitable growth, research and development of innovative technology and other capital priorities. As a result, free cash flow is a key driver to reduce gross leverage and ultimately convert value to shareholders through the valuation process. Accordingly, the Committee modified the 2018 LTI performance metrics to replace EBITDA margin with free cash flow. The Committee believes that relative TSR continues to be an important measure of performance because of its alignment with shareholder value creation. Based on these considerations, the 2018 performance share awards are based 50% on free cash flow and 50% on relative TSR. 
The performance levels set for 2018 LTI required our management team to continue to perform at a high level, achieve integration synergies, implement productivity improvements, successfully launch new product programs and create long-term value. The Committee increased the rigor of the threshold, target and maximum performance levels as shown below.

Payouts under the relative TSR performance share awards resulted in a zero payout to senior management because the threshold performance level was not achieved. This result reflects the Committee's commitment to align LTI pay with the interest of our shareholders through rigorous goal-setting. Our shareholders did not realize value on our stock over this time period. Consequently, and by design, our senior management team received no value from these awards.

The performance targets for the EBITDA margin performance share awards were determined in consideration of AAM's historical EBITDA margins for 2013 – 2015. The maximum performance level was set to drive performance significantly above our peers and encourage EBITDA margin growth. Over this period, management delivered a result well in excess of targets and prior actual performance, which supported an above-target payout. This outstanding financial performance allowed us to reduce debt and position AAM to achieve our strategic objectives.

2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan
At the 2018 annual meeting, our shareholders approved the adoption of the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Beginning in 2019, LTI awards are granted under this plan. In approving the 2019 LTI awards, the Committee determined that 66% of the total LTI award would continue to be performance-based in order to drive superior performance that is aligned with our business strategy. Consistent with 2018 performance-based LTI awards, one-half of the 2019 performance-based LTI award is based on relative TSR and one-half is based on free cash flow performance. The relative TSR portion of the 2019 LTI award is denominated and settled in AAM stock. The free cash flow portion of the 2019 LTI award is a performance unit that is denominated in dollars and settled in cash.

Summary of Direct Compensation
The Committee believes each pay element of direct compensation is consistent with our compensation philosophy. The Committee reviews direct compensation for each NEO and compares each compensation element to the market data of our comparative peer group. The Committee also considers individual performance, experience, internal equity, scope and responsibility of position, retention and other factors. 
Direct compensation for our CEO is higher than for the other NEOs due to the CEO's breadth of executive and operating responsibilities for the entire global enterprise. The Committee does not target CEO pay as a certain multiple of the pay of the other NEOs. For 2018, the Committee set total direct compensation for the NEOs at approximately the 50th percentile of the peer group. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Indirect Compensation Elements 
[END TABLE]
Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans
Our NEOs participate in AAM's qualified retirement and nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans. Each executive officer is eligible to participate in the Company's 401(k) plan, which allows U.S. salaried participants to defer a portion of their base salary up to certain IRS limits.
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), a nonqualified defined benefit plan, provides retirement benefits to executives that are offset by the qualified pension plan benefits. To align our benefit programs with prevailing market practices, the SERP was amended to freeze further benefit accruals as of April 30, 2018 and to freeze the plan to new participants as of April 1, 2018. At the time the legacy SERP was frozen, the AAM Executive Retirement Savings Plan (ERSP) was adopted to become effective January 1, 2019. The ERSP, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, reduces executive retirement benefits and provides cost savings to the Company as compared to the legacy SERP.
The ERSP provides certain highly-compensated associates the opportunity to receive supplemental deferred compensation upon retirement and certain other qualifying events. The Company provides contributions to the plan equal to a percentage of a participant's combined base salary and bonus paid during a calendar year less their maximum eligible 401(k) Company contributions. The Company may also make discretionary contributions. 
In April 2018, the Company also froze the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDC) to further contributions as of December 31, 2018 and to new participants as of April 1, 2018, due to the EDC's limited participation and retention value. Existing contributions will vest and be paid in accordance with the EDC's terms.
The SERP, ERSP and EDC plans are further described in Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.
Other Benefits and Perquisites
Our NEOs participate in the same medical plans as our U.S. salaried associates. A group of approximately 40 senior executives, including the NEOs, also receive supplemental life, supplemental disability and umbrella liability insurance benefits.
AAM provides a very limited number of perquisites to senior executives, including our NEOs. Senior executives are eligible for the use of a Company-provided vehicle with AAM content. Mr. Dauch has the use of two Company-provided vehicles. Occasionally, we invite spouses of AAM executives to attend Company business events and pay for the spouse's travel and related non-business expenses. AAM reimburses the executive for taxes attributable to the income associated with this benefit. We do not otherwise provide tax gross ups for executives except for those available for all salaried associates generally. Perquisites are further described in the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table.

Other Compensation Matters 
[END TABLE]
Severance Programs
The Company provides severance benefits to NEOs (other than the CEO and President) under the AAM Executive Officer Severance Plan (Severance Plan) and the AAM Change in Control Plan (CIC Plan). Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte do not participate in these programs because their employment agreements provide severance payments and benefits as described below. 
The Committee believes that these severance programs provide competitive severance benefits that attract and retain key talent during potentially critical and uncertain periods. These programs are designed to foster stability within senior management by helping executives maintain focus on and dedication to their responsibilities to maximize shareholder value, including in the event of a transaction that may result in a change in control. These programs are also guided by our compensation philosophy and governance practices (e.g., double-trigger change in control provisions, no tax gross ups) and are well aligned with those of our peers. 
The Severance Plan, which was adopted in April 2018, provides severance benefits other than in connection with a change in control. The Committee adopted this plan to further align our programs with market practices. Under the Severance Plan, upon termination of employment by the Company without cause or resignation by a participant for good reason, each eligible executive officer will be entitled to certain severance payments and benefits, including a multiple of base salary and target bonus, prorated annual target bonus for the year of termination and continued participation in the Company's medical benefit plans for the applicable severance period. 
The CIC Plan provides participants, including eligible executive officers, severance payments and benefits in the event of termination of employment on or within two years following a CIC. These benefits include a multiple of base salary and target bonus and continued participation in the Company's medical benefit plans for the applicable severance period. 
Benefits under the Severance Plan and the CIC Plan are subject to execution and non-revocation of a general waiver and release of claims against the Company and compliance with certain restrictive covenants. The benefits are also subject to recoupment or clawback. Benefits provided to our NEOs under these programs are described in Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control. 
Employment Agreements
Severance benefits are provided to Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte under the terms of each of their employment agreements. In connection with the adoption of the Severance Plan in April 2018, their employment agreements were amended to align the calculation of cash severance payable with that of the Severance Plan. Accordingly, severance calculations under the amended employment agreements include a target annual bonus (in addition to base salary) and a prorated annual target bonus for the year of termination. Severance payments will be paid in a lump sum to the extent allowable under Section 409A.
Executive Compensation Recoupment (Clawback) Policy
The clawback policy authorizes the Committee to determine whether to require recoupment of performance-based incentive compensation actually paid or awarded to any executive officer if certain conditions are met. For purposes of this policy, performance-based compensation includes all annual and long-term incentive awards, whether paid in cash or equity, to the extent the awards are based on the Company's financial performance. 
The Committee may require recoupment if the executive officer engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct that caused or contributed to the need for a material restatement of the Company's financial statements filed with the SEC. If the Committee determines that any performance-based compensation paid or awarded to the executive officer would not have been awarded or would have been awarded at a lower amount had it been calculated based on such restated financial statements (adjusted compensation), the Committee may seek to recover for the benefit of the Company the excess of the awarded compensation over the adjusted compensation (excess compensation). In deciding whether to seek recovery of excess compensation from the executive officer, the

Committee will consider the factors it deems relevant under the circumstances and whether the assertion of a claim is in the best interests of the Company. 
Executive Officer Stock Ownership Requirements
Our stock ownership policy is an important feature of our compensation philosophy that helps to ensure alignment of our executives' interests with those of our stockholders. The stock ownership requirement for each executive is based on the executive's position as described below.

AAM prohibits employees and non-employee directors from entering into transactions that may result in a financial benefit if our stock price declines, or any hedging transaction involving our stock, including the use of financial derivatives, short sales or any similar transactions. Pledging of AAM stock is also prohibited. 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
We conducted an annual risk assessment for the Committee to determine whether the risks arising from our 2018 compensation practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The risk assessment considered AAM's annual and long-term incentive programs and pay mix, performance measures used to calculate payouts, and pay philosophy and governance. Our annual assessment focuses on the program for executive officers in light of their decision-making authority and influence, but also considers the compensation of other salaried associates. Our methodology was reviewed by the Committee and Meridian.  
We have designed our compensation programs with specific features to address potential risks while rewarding our executive officers and other associates for achieving long-term financial and strategic objectives through prudent business judgment and appropriate risk taking. Based on our risk assessment and consideration of various mitigating factors, we concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Tax Deductibility of Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Code (Section 162(m)) generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1 million paid to certain "covered employees."  Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, the definition of "covered employees" under Section 162(m) includes a company's CEO, CFO and the three other most highly compensated executive officers. Once an officer is a "covered employee," the officer's pay will remain subject to Section 162(m) for so long as the officer is receiving compensation from the Company. Further, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the exclusion for "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) effective January 1, 2018, except for compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract in place before November 2, 2017 that is not materially modified thereafter (a grandfathered arrangement). The Company can no longer grant qualified performance-based compensation. Outstanding awards that previously qualified for the performance-based compensation exclusion under Section 162(m) may or may not qualify as grandfathered awards.

Annual Incentive Awards
In 2018, annual incentive awards were granted under the AAM Incentive Compensation Program for Executive Officers.  Absolute EBITDA was selected as sole performance metric for these awards. The maximum payout for each performance metric is 200%. See Annual Incentive Compensation in the CD&A.
Long-Term Incentive Awards
In 2018, the Company granted long-term incentive awards to NEOs in the form of RSUs and performance share awards. The terms of these awards are described in Long-Term Incentive Compensation in the CD&A.
2018 Awards Granted Under the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan
Restricted Stock Units 
The RSUs granted in 2018 to NEOs vest in three years. All RSUs are payable in common stock. 
Performance Share Awards
The performance share awards granted to NEOs in 2018 are based upon the attainment of certain Free Cash Flow performance targets and relative TSR over a three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The performance share awards represented 66% of the total LTI award opportunity for executive officers. One-half of the 2018 performance share payouts, or 33% of the total LTI award, will be measured by Free Cash Flow performance and one-half, or 33% of the total LTI award, will be measured by relative TSR performance over a three-year period. TSR performance share payouts will be capped if the Company's TSR is negative for the three-year period. All performance shares are payable in common stock.

Pension Benefits
The NEOs are eligible to participate in pension plans that provide benefits based on years of service and pay.  Pension benefits are provided under a qualified defined benefit pension plan, AAM's Salaried Retirement Program (SRP) and for Mr. Willemse, the Albion Pension Plan. Supplemental pension benefits are provided under the nonqualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Program (SERP). 
In 2018, the SERP was amended to freeze further benefit accruals as of April 30, 2018. The amendment also froze the plan to new participants as of April 1, 2018. Frozen benefits will pay out in accordance with the SERP's terms.

Salaried Retirement Program (SRP). The annual retirement benefit payable to each executive, commencing on retirement at or after age 65, equals the sum of the executive's contributions plus an additional benefit based on the executive's average monthly salary (determined as the average of the executive's base salary in the highest 60 months during his final 10 years of service) and years of credited service. Benefits under the SRP may be paid as a single life annuity or, upon election, in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with a reduction in the amount of the annual benefit. The SRP is a qualified plan subject to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) limitations on benefits and is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
Effective December 31, 2006, the SRP was amended to freeze benefits at current levels for associates who were not eligible to retire by December 1, 2011. Associates who were eligible for early or normal retirement on or before December 31, 2011 continued to accrue benefits through December 31, 2011. 
Albion Pension Plan. Our Albion Automotive Limited subsidiary provides pension benefits under the Albion Pension Plan for its salaried associates. Mr. Willemse is a participant in this plan based on his former employment with this subsidiary. The annual retirement benefit payable, commencing on retirement at or after age 65, is based on the participant's average salary (as defined in the plan during the final 10 years of service with Albion Automotive  
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Limited), years of pensionable service and the percentage of participant contributions to the plan. The participant may elect benefits to be in the form of an annuity or to receive a portion of the benefit payable in a lump sum.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Program (SERP). Executive officers who were hired before April 1, 2018 are eligible to receive a benefit under the SERP, payable six months after retirement in a lump sum. The now frozen SERP benefit amount was determined as of April 30, 3018 as 12.5% of the executive's final average compensation (determined as the executive's average annual base salary and cash incentive for the highest five consecutive years), multiplied by the executive's years of credited service, less the sum of the actuarial equivalent value of the executive's benefits payable under the SRP, the Albion Pension Plan and the balance of the executive's employer retirement contribution account under AAM's 401(k) plan.

Amounts deferred or credited into this plan are represented in the executive's notional account and are "invested" among funds also available under AAM's 401(k) plan. Although the executive has no actual or constructive ownership of shares in the investment funds, the return on the executive's account is determined as if the amounts were notionally invested in these funds.
Distributions can be received (1) upon retirement in a lump sum or in annual payments over a period of five or ten years, (2) in a lump sum upon death, disability, termination of employment or change in control or (3) if elected by the participant, during employment at a specified date after a minimum deferral period of three years. Distributions during employment consist of participant deferrals and related earnings or losses (not Company contributions and related earnings or losses).
Executive Retirement Savings Plan
In connection with freezing the SERP and the EDC, we adopted the AAM Executive Retirement Savings Plan (ERSP) effective as of January 1, 2019. The ERSP is a nonqualified deferred compensation program contributed to by the Company to provide certain highly-compensated associates, including the NEOs, the opportunity to receive supplemental deferred compensation upon retirement and certain other qualifying events. The ERSP does not provide for participant contributions. 
ERSP eligible executives will receive an annual contribution to their account equal to 10% of combined base salary and bonus paid during a calendar year less their maximum eligible 401(k) Company contributions. In addition, certain participants, including the NEOs, are eligible to receive an additional Company contribution equal to 12.5% of base salary and bonus paid for a period of 5 calendar years. The Company also may make discretionary contributions. 
Amounts deferred or credited into this plan are represented in the executive's notional account and are "invested" among funds also available under AAM's 401(k) plan. Although the executive has no actual or constructive ownership of shares in the investment funds, the return on the executive's account is determined as if the amounts were notionally invested in these funds.
ERSP contributions and account balances vest at the earliest of the following:

No contributions were made to this plan in 2018.

In April 2018, the investment fund options under AAM's 401(k) plan were changed. The new funds selected were replaced with similar fund options.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following tables show the estimated potential payments and benefits that each of the NEOs would receive upon termination of employment under various circumstances that would trigger payments under applicable employment agreements and the Company's plans and programs, assuming the termination event occurred on December 31, 2018. Although the calculations are intended to provide reasonable estimates of the potential payments, they are based on numerous assumptions and may not represent the actual amounts these NEOs would receive upon each termination event. 
Employment Agreements
Under our employment agreements with Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte, the Company may terminate their employment with or without cause. Cause means:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– a material breach of his obligations under the agreement; 
– the willful and continued failure or refusal to satisfactorily perform his duties; 
– a conviction of or pleading guilty (or no contest) to a felony or to another crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude or which reflects negatively upon the Company or impairs its operations; 
– engaging in any misconduct, negligence, act of dishonesty (including any violation of federal securities laws) or violence that is materially injurious to the Company; 
– a material breach of a restrictive covenant (i.e., non-competition, non-solicitation) or Company policy; 
– refusal to follow the directions of the Board; or 
– any other willful misconduct that is materially injurious to AAM's financial condition or business reputation. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte may resign for good reason, which means:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– a material decrease in compensation or a failure by the Company to pay material compensation; 
– a material diminution of responsibilities, positions or titles (other than solely as a result of the Company ceasing to be a publicly-traded company); 
– relocation more than 50 miles outside the Detroit-metropolitan area; or 
– a material breach by the Company of its obligations under the agreement. 
[END TABLE]
Upon termination for cause or resignation without good reason, Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte are entitled to receive only accrued and unpaid compensation. Participation in the Company's benefit plans would cease upon termination.
If employment is terminated without cause or upon resignation for good reason on or within two years following a CIC, Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte are entitled to a severance payment of a multiple of annual base salary and annual bonus, plus a target annual bonus prorated through the termination date. The annual bonus payment is determined based on the higher of his target annual bonus for either the year of the CIC or the year of termination. The severance multiple for Mr. Dauch is three times and Mr. Simonte's multiple is two times. In addition, each would receive medical benefit continuation after termination of employment following a CIC; Mr. Dauch for three years and Mr. Simonte for two years. Each would also receive outplacement services; Mr. Dauch $50,000 and Mr. Simonte $30,000.  
If employment is terminated without cause, or upon resignation for good reason not in connection with a CIC, Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte are entitled to a severance payment of two times annual base salary and annual target bonus, plus a target annual bonus prorated through the termination date.  Payments of base salary are paid in accordance with ordinary payroll practices commencing on the 60th day following separation of service or in a lump sum to the extent allowable under Section 409A.  Target bonus amounts are payable in a lump sum on the 60th day following the termination date. In addition, each would receive medical benefit continuation for two years. Each are also entitled to receive accrued and unpaid compensation, as well as outplacement services; Mr. Dauch $50,000 and Mr. Simonte $30,000.
Certain severance payments are subject to recoupment or clawback. Salary and benefit continuation is also subject to compliance with the confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and intellectual property assignment provisions of each employment agreement as well as the execution and non-revocation of a general waiver and release of claims. 
If employment terminates due to disability or death, Mr. Dauch and Mr. Simonte will be entitled to accrued benefits under applicable benefit plans and programs.

AAM Executive Officer Severance Plan
Under the AAM Executive Officer Severance Plan, upon termination of employment by the Company without cause or resignation by an executive officer participant for good reason not in connection with a CIC, each participant will be entitled to certain severance payments and benefits, in addition to other accrued compensation and benefits, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– a cash amount equal to annual base salary and target annual bonus multiplied by up to 1.5 based on position; target annual bonus is determined as the target amount in the year of termination;

– reimbursement of outplacement service costs of up to $20,000; and 
– continued participation in AAM's medical benefit plans for up to 1.5 years following termination of employment based on position, or, in certain cases, a cash amount equal to the value of the benefit continuation. 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the Severance Plan, cause means: (1) the participant's willful and continued failure or refusal to satisfactorily perform his/her duties; (2) a conviction of or pleading guilty (or no contest) to a felony or to another crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude or which reflects negatively upon the Company or impairs its operations; (3) engaging in any willful misconduct, gross negligence, act of dishonesty (including any violation of federal securities laws) or violence that is injurious to the Company; (4) a material breach of any restrictive covenant or any material written policy of the Company; (5) a material failure to comply with any material applicable laws and regulations or professional standards relating to the business of the Company; or (6) any other misconduct that is injurious to the financial condition or business reputation of the Company.
The Severance Plan defines good reason to include any of the following acts or omissions: (1) a material reduction in a participant's annual base salary or bonus opportunity in effect immediately prior to the reduction; or (2) a relocation of the office at which the participant is to perform the majority of his or her duties to a location more than 50 miles from such location at which the participant performed such duties prior to the relocation. 
These benefits are subject to execution and non-revocation of a general waiver and release of claims against the Company and continued compliance with the restrictive covenants of the Severance Plan. The benefits are also subject to recoupment or clawback.
AAM Change in Control Plan
Under the AAM Change in Control Plan, upon termination of employment by the Company without cause or resignation by an executive officer participant for good reason on or within two years following a CIC, each participant will be entitled to certain severance payments and benefits, in addition to other accrued compensation and benefits, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– a cash amount equal to annual base salary multiplied by two; 
– a cash amount equal to target annual bonus multiplied by two, with target annual bonus determined as the greater of the target amount in the year of the CIC or the year of termination of employment; 
– a prorated target annual bonus with the target annual bonus determined as the greater of the target amount in the year of the CIC or the year of termination of employment; 
– reimbursement of outplacement service costs of up to $30,000 incurred within 24 months following termination of employment; and 
– continued participation in AAM's medical benefit plans for two years following termination of employment, or, in certain cases, a cash amount equal to the value of the benefit continuation. 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the CIC Plan, cause means: (1) the participant's willful and continued failure or refusal to satisfactorily perform his/her duties; (2) a conviction of or pleading guilty (or no contest) to a felony or to another crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude or which reflects negatively upon the Company or impairs its operations; (3) engaging in any willful misconduct, gross negligence, act of dishonesty (including any violation of federal securities laws) or violence that is injurious to the Company; (4) a material breach of any employment agreement restrictive covenant or any material written policy of the Company; (5) a material failure to comply with any material applicable laws and regulations or professional standards relating to the business of the Company; or (6) any other misconduct that is injurious to the financial condition or business reputation of the Company.
The CIC Plan defines good reason to include any of the following acts or omissions: (1) a material reduction in a participant's position, authority, duties or responsibilities following the CIC; (2) a material reduction in a participant's annual base salary or bonus opportunity in effect prior to the CIC; or (3) a relocation of the office at which the  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Table of Contents Executive Compensation Tables 
[END TABLE]
participant is to perform the majority of his or her duties following a CIC to a location more than 50 miles from such location prior to the CIC. 
These benefits are subject to execution and non-revocation of a general waiver and release of claims against the Company and continued compliance with the restrictive covenants of the CIC Plan.  The benefits are also subject to recoupment or clawback.
No Tax Gross Ups
The Company does not provide tax gross ups to executive officers upon a CIC. If any of the payments or benefits under Mr. Dauch's or Mr. Simonte's employment agreement or the CIC Plan are deemed to be parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the payments or benefits will be reduced by the amount required to avoid the excise tax if the reduction would give a better after-tax result than if the full payments and benefits were received.
Non-Competition Agreements 
Pursuant to their non-competition agreements with the Company, Mr. May, Mr. Satine and Mr. Willemse are prohibited, while employed by AAM and for one year following termination of employment (prior to a CIC), from:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– directly or indirectly engaging in any business that competes with AAM; 
– soliciting or inducing our employees to leave AAM or otherwise interfering with our relationship with our employees, agents or consultants; and 
– using, exploiting or disclosing our confidential information to any third party without our prior written consent.

CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that the Company determine the ratio of the CEO's total compensation (under the Summary Compensation Table definition) to that of AAM's global median employee.
To determine the median employee, we made a direct determination from our global employee population, excluding non-U.S. locations to the extent that the total employees excluded in these locations in the aggregate did not exceed 5% of our total employee population. We have excluded 723 employees in Germany, 380 in Thailand, 79 in Korea, 4 in Japan and 4 in Luxembourg out of our global employee population of approximately 25,000. We established a consistently applied compensation measure inclusive of base pay, overtime, incentives and allowances. Our population was evaluated as of October 31, 2017 and reflects paid compensation from January 1, 2017 through October 31, 2017. Where allowed under the rule, we have annualized compensation through December 31, 2017. We included the employer cost of medical, dental and vision benefits for both the median employee and the CEO. Non-U.S. compensation was converted to U.S. dollars based on applicable exchange rates as of October 31, 2017. There have been no significant changes in our workforce population or compensation arrangements for 2018 that would impact the methodology that was used to calculate the median employee in 2017, and the Company has determined to use the same median employee identified last year.
Based on the above determination, the total compensation for the median employee is $55,835. Using the CEO's total compensation of $9,490,429 (including the employer cost of medical, dental and vision benefits), the resulting ratio is 170:1.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee's policy is to approve in advance all audit and permitted non-audit services (including scope, fee structure and the potential effect of the service on the auditor's independence) to be performed for the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year, is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis. The Chairman of the Audit Committee may pre-approve permissible non-audit services that arise between Audit Committee meetings, provided the fees do not exceed a limit established by the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee is informed of the decision to pre-approve the service at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee received regular updates on the amount of fees and scope of audit, non-audit and tax services provided by D&T during 2018. All services provided by D&T during fiscal 2018 were authorized and approved by the Audit Committee in compliance with applicable pre-approval policies and procedures.

Report of the Audit Committee 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company's financial reporting process by monitoring, among other matters, the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements, the independence and performance of Deloitte & Touche LLP (D&T), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and the performance of the Company's internal auditors. Management has primary responsibility for preparing the consolidated financial statements and for the reporting processes, including the design and maintenance of the Company's system of internal controls. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the Company's consolidated financial statements and opining upon the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The Audit Committee is solely responsible for the compensation, appointment and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management, D&T and the internal auditors, separately and together, with and without management present, regarding the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The Audit Committee also discussed with D&T the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, applicable rules of the SEC, and other relevant professional and regulatory standards, which include, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Further, the Audit Committee discussed with the internal auditors the Company's plans for and scope of internal audits, identification of audit risks and results of audit activities.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with D&T the auditor's independence from the Company and the Company's management. As part of that review, D&T submitted to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by requirements of the PCAOB regarding D&T's communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence. Further, the Audit Committee discussed with D&T the firm's independence and considered whether D&T's performance of non-audit services to the Company was compatible with maintaining D&T's independence. The Audit Committee concluded that D&T is independent from the Company and its management.
Based on the considerations described above and the limitations of the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in the Company's 2018 annual report on Form 10-K.

Voting and Meeting Information
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
You received these proxy materials because you owned shares of AAM common stock on March 5, 2019 (record date). AAM's Board is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the annual meeting. By use of a proxy, you can vote whether or not you attend the meeting. This proxy statement describes the matters on which you are asked to vote so you can make an informed decision. 
This proxy statement, together with our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, a proxy card and a voter instruction card, will be mailed or can be accessed online on or about March 21, 2019. We refer to these documents as AAM's proxy solicitation materials. 
What is "Notice and Access" and why did AAM elect to use it?
We make our proxy solicitation materials available to stockholders electronically under the Notice and Access regulations of the SEC. Most of our stockholders receive a notice of electronic availability (notice) instead of a full set of proxy solicitation materials in the mail. The notice explains how to access and review the proxy solicitation materials and how to vote online. We believe this method of delivery expedites distribution of our proxy solicitation materials and allows us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing these materials. 
If you received a notice but would prefer to receive printed copies of the proxy solicitation materials in the mail, please follow the instructions in the notice.
How do I vote?
You may vote by any of the following methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
– In person — attending the annual meeting and casting a ballot. 
– By mail — using the proxy and/or voting instruction card provided. 
– By telephone or over the Internet — following the instructions on your notice card, proxy and/or voting instruction card. 
[END TABLE]
If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, have your notice card or proxy and/or voting instruction card available. The control number on your card is necessary to process your vote. A telephone or Internet vote authorizes the named proxies to vote in the same manner as if you marked, signed and returned the card by mail. If you hold shares in street name, refer to the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other record holder. If your shares are held in street name and you wish to vote them in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a "legal proxy" from your holder of record to do so.
How many shares may vote at the meeting?
As of March 5, 2019, we had 111,742,180 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Under AAM's by-laws, a majority of these shares must be present in person or by proxy to hold the annual meeting and take any action during the meeting.
Can I change my vote?
You may change your vote at any time before the annual meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
How many votes must be present to hold the meeting?
Under our by-laws, a majority of the votes that can be cast must be present in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum for the annual meeting. Abstentions and shares represented by broker non-votes (explained below) will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.
What are my choices when voting?
Proposal 1 — You may vote for or against each nominee, or you may abstain from voting your shares.
Proposal 2 — You may vote for or against the proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, or you may abstain from voting your shares.
Proposal 3 — You may vote for or against the proposal to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, or you may abstain from voting your shares.
How many vote are needed for the proposals to pass?
In an uncontested election, nominees for director who receive a majority of "for" votes cast (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee exceed the number of shares voted "against" that nominee) will be elected. If an incumbent director nominee does not receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election, our by-laws require the director to promptly tender a written resignation to the Board. After receiving a recommendation from the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the Board will determine whether to accept or reject the resignation, and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days of the date the election results are certified. 
Each of the other proposals will pass if the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy are cast in favor of the proposal.
Who will count the votes?
Representatives of Computershare Trust Company, N.A., AAM's transfer agent, will count the votes and serve as our inspector of election. The inspector of election will attend the annual meeting.
What if I abstain from voting or vote "abstain"?
In you abstain from voting or vote "abstain," your shares will: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
– be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there are enough votes to establish a quorum; 
– have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors; or 
– count as a vote against any other proposal to be considered at the annual meeting. 
[END TABLE]
What if I don't return my proxy card and don't attend the annual meeting?
If your shares are registered in your own name with our transfer agent and you do not vote, your shares will not be voted at all. 
If you hold your shares in "street name" and do not give your bank, broker, or other holder of record specific voting instructions, your record holder may vote your shares on the ratification of the independent registered public firm, but may not vote your shares on any other matter that comes before the annual meeting. If you do not provide voting instructions on these matters, the votes will be considered "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, but will not affect the outcome of any proposal. We urge you to give your record holder voting instructions on each proposal being presented at the annual meeting.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
AAM has included in the proxy statement adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, which are financial metrics used in the AAM Incentive Compensation Program for Executive Officers and the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan. These metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in the tables below in accordance with SEC rules.

(1)   AAM sold the Powertrain aftermarket business in April 2018. Prior to that sale, in February 2018, performance goals for our annual incentive plan were established. As a result of this timing, full-year EBITDA associated with the sold business was included in the 2018 annual incentive target. This adjustment reflects the impact of the budgeted EBITDA performance for the portion of the year that has been excluded from actual EBITDA results. Considering the impact of this adjustment, actual adjusted EBITDA reflects EBITDA of this business through the closing date of April 4, 2018. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 was adjusted by this amount for purposes of calculating performance achievements under the plans that use EBITDA performance as a measure.
