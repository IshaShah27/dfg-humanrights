Dear Shareholder:
On behalf of the Board of Directors and management of Lakeland Financial Corporation, we cordially         invite you to attend the annual meeting of shareholders of Lakeland Financial Corporation to be held at 4:30 p.m. (local time) on April 9, 2019, at The Lerner Theatre, located at 410 South Main Street, Elkhart, Indiana 46516.
This year we are again using the Securities and Exchange Commission rule that allows us to furnish our         proxy statement, our 2018 summary annual report to shareholders, a copy of our annual report on Form 10-K and proxy card to shareholders over the Internet. This means that, unless you have previously requested to receive only printed materials, you         will receive only a notice containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet and vote online. If you receive this notice but would still like to request paper copies of the proxy materials, please follow the         instructions on the notice or on the website referred to on the notice. By delivering proxy materials electronically to our shareholders, we can reduce the costs of printing and mailing our proxy materials. Please visit www.proxyvote.com for more         information about the electronic delivery of proxy materials.
There are a number of proposals to be considered at the meeting. Our Nominating and Corporate         Governance Committee has nominated thirteen persons to serve as directors, each of whom is an incumbent director. If elected, each director would serve a one-year term. Additionally, we have included a non-binding advisory proposal on the         compensation of certain executive officers. Finally, our Audit Committee has selected, and we recommend that you ratify the selection of, Crowe LLP to continue as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31,         2019.
We recommend you vote your shares "FOR" each of the director nominees, "FOR" the approval of the         compensation of our executive management as described in the proxy statement, and "FOR" the ratification of our accountants.
We will also review our performance in 2018 at the meeting and update you on our strategic plan as we         move forward. You are welcome to attend a reception immediately following the annual meeting.
We encourage you to attend the meeting in person. However, whether or not you plan to attend the meeting in person, please take the time to vote by following the instructions provided on the notice as soon as possible. This will ensure that         your shares are represented at the meeting.
We look forward with pleasure to seeing and visiting with you at the meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Very truly yours,  
 David M. Findlay President and Chief Executive Officer

PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
April 9, 2019
_______________________________
This proxy statement is being furnished to our shareholders in connection with the solicitation by our         Board of Directors (the "Board") of proxies to be used at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held at The Lerner Theatre, located at 410 South Main Street, Elkhart, Indiana 46516 on Tuesday, April 9, 2019 at 4:30 p.m. (local time), or at any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. Our summary annual report to shareholders, including consolidated financial statements for         the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and a copy of our Form 10-K, which we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), are also available. These proxy materials are first being made available or distributed to         shareholders on or prior to February 28, 2019.
ABOUT THE MEETING
The following is information regarding the meeting and the voting process,         presented in a question and answer format. As used in this proxy statement, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "Lakeland Financial," "the Company," "we," "our" and "us" all refer to Lakeland Financial Corporation and its direct and         indirect subsidiaries.
Why did I receive access to the proxy materials?
We have made the proxy materials available to you over the Internet because on         February 19, 2019, the record date for the annual meeting, you owned shares of our common stock. This proxy statement describes the matters that will be presented for consideration by the shareholders at the annual meeting. It also gives you         information concerning those matters to assist you in making an informed decision.
When you vote pursuant to one of the methods set forth herein, you appoint the         proxy holder as your representative at the meeting. The proxy holder will vote your shares as you instruct, thereby ensuring that your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the meeting, we ask that         you instruct the proxies how to vote your shares in advance of the meeting just in case your plans change.
If you appointed the proxies to vote your shares and an issue comes up for a vote         at the meeting that is not identified in the proxy materials, the proxy holder will vote your shares, pursuant to your proxy, in accordance with his or her judgment.
Why did I receive a notice regarding the Internet availability of proxy         materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials?
We are using the SEC notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy         materials over the Internet to our shareholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each shareholder. As a result, beginning on or prior to February 28, 2019, we sent our shareholders (other than those who had previously requested         to receive only printed copies of our proxy materials) by mail a notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet and vote online. This notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If you         received a notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the notice or on the website referred to in the notice. 
What matters will be voted on at the meeting?
You are being asked to vote on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the election of the 13 director nominees named in this proxy statement for a one-year term                    expiring in 2020;  
· a non-binding advisory proposal on the compensation of certain executive officers, otherwise                    known as a "say-on-pay" proposal; and  
· the ratification of the appointment of Crowe LLP as our independent registered public                    accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
These matters are more fully described in this proxy statement.
If I am the record holder of my shares, how do I vote?
You may vote by:
· telephone;
· Internet;
· mail;
[BEGIN TABLE]
· completing, signing, dating and mailing the proxy card you received in the mail if you                    received paper copies of the proxy materials; or  
[END TABLE]
· in person at the meeting.
If you vote using one of the methods described above, your shares will be voted as         you instruct.
If you sign and return your proxy card or vote over the Internet or by telephone         without giving specific voting instructions, the shares represented by your proxy card will be voted:
· "FOR" all nominees named in this proxy statement; and
· "FOR" each of the other proposals described in this proxy statement.
Although you may vote by mail, we ask that you vote instead by Internet or         telephone, which saves us postage and processing costs.
You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number specified on your notice         card or by accessing the Internet website referred to on your notice card, in each case by following the preprinted instructions on the notice card. Votes submitted by telephone or Internet must be received by 11:59 p.m. on Monday, April 8, 2019.         The giving of a proxy by either of these means will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the meeting.
If you want to vote in person, please come to the meeting. We will distribute         written ballots to anyone who wants to vote at the meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held in the name of a broker or other nominee (or what is usually referred to as "street name"), you will need to arrange to obtain a proxy         from the record holder in order to vote in person at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we ask that you complete and return your proxy card in advance of the annual meeting in case your plans change.
If I hold shares in the name of a broker or other nominee, who votes my         shares?
 If you are a beneficial owner and a broker or other nominee is the record         holder, then you received access to these proxy materials from the record holder. The record holder should have given you instructions for directing how the record holder should vote your shares. It will then be the record holder's responsibility         to vote your shares for you in the manner you direct.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers and other nominees may generally         vote on routine matters, such as the ratification of an independent registered public accounting firm, without your direction, but cannot vote on non-routine matters unless they have received voting instructions from the person for whom they are         holding shares. The election of directors and the say-on-pay proposal areconsidered non-routine matters. If your broker or other nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on these matters, your broker or other         nominee will return the proxy card to us indicating that he or she does not have authority to vote. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." We therefore encourage you to provide directions to your broker as to how you want         your shares voted on all matters to be brought before the meeting. You should do this by carefully following the instructions your broker gives you concerning its procedures.
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
It means that you have multiple holdings reflected in our stock transfer records         and/or in accounts with brokers. To vote all of your shares by proxy, please follow the separate voting instructions that you received for your shares of common stock held in each of your different accounts.
What if I change my mind after I return my proxy card?
If you hold your shares in your own name, you may revoke your proxy and change your         vote at any time before the polls close at the meeting. You may do this by:
· signing another proxy with a later date and returning that proxy to us;
· timely submitting another proxy via the telephone or Internet;
· sending notice to us that you are revoking your proxy; or
· voting in person at the meeting.
If you hold your shares in the name of your broker or other nominee and desire to         change your instructions on how to vote your shares, you will need to contact that party.
How many shares must be represented in order to hold the annual meeting?
A majority of the shares that are outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record         date must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting in order to hold the meeting and conduct business.
Shares are counted as present at the meeting if the shareholder either:
· is present and votes in person at the meeting; or
[BEGIN TABLE]
· has properly submitted a signed proxy card or other form of proxy (through the telephone or Internet).  
[END TABLE]
On February 19, 2019, the record date, there were 25,614,046 shares of common stock         issued and outstanding. Therefore, at least 12,807,024 shares need to be present at the annual meeting for a quorum to be present.
What happens if a director nominee is unable to stand for re-election?
The Board may, by resolution, provide for a lesser number of directors or designate         a substitute nominee. In the latter case, shares represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee. Proxies cannot be voted for more than 13 nominees. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have no reason to believe any nominee will         be unable to stand for re-election.
What options do I have in voting on each of the proposals?
You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each director nominee         and on each of the proposals described in this proxy statement, and on any other proposal properly brought before the meeting.
How many votes may I cast?
You are entitled to cast one vote for each share of stock you owned on the record         date. 
How many votes are needed for each proposal?
A majority of the votes cast by the holders of the stock having voting power at the         meeting will approve each matter that arises at the annual meeting.
Please note, however, because the vote on the say-on-pay proposal is advisory, it         will not be binding upon the Board or the Compensation Committee. Also, please remember that the election of directors and the say-on-pay proposal are each considered non-routine matters. Consequently, if your shares are held by a broker or other         nominee, it cannot vote your shares on these matters unless it has received voting instructions from you.
Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast, but         will count for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum is present. So long as a quorum is present, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on any of the matters presented for a vote at the annual meeting.
Where do I find the voting results of the meeting?
If available, we will announce voting results at the meeting. The voting results         will also be disclosed on a Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the meeting.
Who bears the cost of soliciting proxies?
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to solicitations by mail, officers, directors         or employees of Lakeland Financial may solicit proxies in person or by telephone. These persons will not receive any special or additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We may reimburse brokerage houses and other nominees for their         reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to shareholders.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
General
The Board has adopted guidelines on significant corporate governance matters that, together with our         Code of Conduct and other policies, create our corporate governance standards. You may view the Corporate Governance Guidelines and our committee charters and other policies in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.lakecitybank.com.
Generally, the Board oversees our business and monitors the performance of our management. In         accordance with our corporate governance procedures, the Board does not involve itself in the day-to-day operations of Lakeland Financial, which is monitored by our executive officers and management. Our directors fulfill their duties and         responsibilities by attending regular meetings of the Board, which convenes at least six times a year, and through committee membership, which is discussed below. Our directors also discuss business and other matters with Mr. Findlay, our President         and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. O'Neill, our Chief Financial Officer, other key executives and our principal external advisers (legal counsel, auditors and other consultants). All members of our Board also serve as members of the Board of         Directors of Lake City Bank, our wholly owned bank subsidiary.
With the exception of Mr. Kubacki, who was an executive officer until April 2016, and Mr. Findlay, who         is an executive officer, all of our current directors are "independent," as defined by the listing rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, and we have determined that the independent directors do not have other relationships with us that         prevent them from making objective, independent decisions. The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and a Compensation Committee, among other committees. 
Our Board held six meetings during 2018. All of the incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the         Board meetings and meetings of committees of which they were members. While we do not have a specific policy regarding attendance at the annual shareholder meeting, all directors are encouraged and expected to attend the meeting. All of our current         directors attended last year's annual meeting.

(4)  The Corporate Risk Committee is a committee of the Board of Directors of Lake         City Bank.
Audit Committee
Each current member of the Audit Committee is expected to serve on the committee until our annual         meeting of shareholders in 2020 if re-elected to the Board. The Board has determined that Mr. Smith is an audit committee financial expert on the basis of his education, his certified public accounting certificate, his professional experience in         public accounting at the firm of EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young LLP) from 1986-1990 and his strong financial background managing Heritage Financial Group. Each member of the Audit Committee is considered "independent" according to the         Nasdaq listing requirements.
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist the Board in monitoring (1)         the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (2) the independent auditor's qualifications and independence, (3) the Company's system of internal controls, (4) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent         auditors, and (5) the compliance by the Company with ethics policies and legal and regulatory requirements. The functions performed by the Audit Committee include, among other things, the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· overseeing our accounting and financial reporting;  
· selecting, appointing and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm;  
· reviewing actions by management on recommendations of our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· meeting with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review the effectiveness of our system of internal                          controls and internal audit procedures; and  
· reviewing reports of bank regulatory agencies and monitoring management's compliance with recommendations contained in those reports.  
[END TABLE]
To promote independence of the audit function, the committee consults separately and jointly with our         independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management. We have adopted a written charter for the committee, which sets forth the committee's duties and responsibilities. The committee's current charter is available in         the Investor Relations section of our website at www.lakecitybank.com.
Compensation Committee
Each current member of the Compensation Committee is expected to serve on the committee until our         annual meeting of shareholders in 2020 if re-elected to the Board. Each of the members is considered "independent" according to the Nasdaq listing requirements, an "outside" director pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the         "Code") and a "non-employee" director under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The functions performed by the Compensation Committee include, among other things,         the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· review and approve the performance goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our                    Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the other executive officers;  
· evaluate the performance of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the                    other executive officers and set the compensation level of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the other executive officers based upon such evaluation;  
· review and approve all employment agreements, severance arrangements and change in control                    agreements or provisions, if any, for the executive officers;  
· make recommendations to the full Board regarding annual compensation of the directors,                    including equity-based compensation;  
· administer our equity incentive plans, our long-term incentive plan and our executive                    incentive bonus plan;  
· evaluate the risks associated with all employee compensation plans; and  
· evaluate the independence of advisors to the Compensation Committee prior to their                    engagement.  
[END TABLE]
We have adopted a written charter for the committee, which sets forth the committee's duties and         responsibilities. The committee's current charter is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.lakecitybank.com.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
We also have a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each current member is expected to serve         on the committee until our annual meeting of shareholders in 2020 if re-elected to the Board. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is considered "independent" according to the Nasdaq listing requirements. The primary         purposes of the committee are to identify and recommend individuals to be presented to our shareholders for election or re-election to the Board and to review and monitor our policies, procedures and structure as they relate to corporate         governance. We have adopted a written charter for the committee, which sets forth the committee's duties and responsibilities. The committee's current charter is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.lakecitybank.com. 
Director Nominations and Qualifications
For the 2019 annual meeting, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee nominated for         re-election to the Board thirteen incumbent directors whose terms are set to expire in 2019. This nomination was further approved by the full Board. We did not receive any shareholder nominations for director for the 2019 annual meeting.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all potential nominees for election,         including incumbent directors, Board nominees and shareholder nominees, in the same manner. As described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the committee believes that, at a minimum, directors should possess certain qualities, including the         highest personal and professional ethics and integrity, a sufficient educational and professional background, demonstrated leadership skills, sound judgment, a strong sense of service to the communities that we serve and an ability to meet the         standards and duties set forth in our code of conduct. Additionally, all nominees must be under the age of 72, which is the mandatory retirement age established by the Board. While we do not have a separate diversity policy, the committee does         consider the diversity of its directors and nominees in terms of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and other demographics that may contribute to the Board. The committee also evaluates potential nominees to determine if they have any         conflicts of interest that may interfere with their ability to serve as effective Board members and to determine whether they are "independent" in accordance with Nasdaq requirements (to ensure that at least a majority of the directors will, at all         times, be independent). The committee has not, in the past, retained any third party to assist it in identifying candidates.
The committee generally identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board who         are willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the Board does not wish to         continue in service or if the committee or the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the committee would evaluate the skills and experience of a potential nominee in light of the criteria above.
Shareholder Communication with the Board, Nomination and Proposal Procedures
General Communications with the Board. Shareholders may contact Lakeland Financial's Board by contacting Kristin L. Pruitt, Corporate Secretary, at Lakeland Financial Corporation, P.O. Box 1387, Warsaw, Indiana, 46581-1387 or (574)         267-6144. Ms. Pruitt will generally not forward communications to the Board that are primarily commercial in nature or related to an improper or irrelevant topic.
Nominations of Directors. In accordance with our bylaws, a shareholder may nominate a director for election to the         Board at an annual meeting of shareholders by delivering written notice of the nomination to the Company's chairman of the Board. To be timely, the notice must be delivered or mailed not less than 150 days nor more than 180 days prior to the date         of the annual meeting. The shareholder's notice of intention to nominate a director must include the name and address of the proposed nominee, the principal occupation of the proposed nominee, the total number of shares of capital stock of Lakeland         Financial that will be voted for each proposed nominee, the name and address of the shareholder making the nomination and the number of shares of capital stock of Lakeland Financial owned by the notifying shareholder. We may request additional         information after receiving the notification.
Other Shareholder Proposals. For all other shareholder proposals to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to our annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2020, shareholder proposals         must be received by Kristin L. Pruitt, our Corporate Secretary, at the above address, no later than October 31, 2019, and must otherwise comply with the rules and regulations set forth by the SEC. 
Board Leadership Structure
The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Lakeland Financial had         historically been combined until April of 2014 when Mr. Kubacki, who had previously held both positions, stepped down as Chief Executive Officer. At that time, Mr. Findlay was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Lakeland Financial         Corporation. Mr. Kubacki has continued to serve as Chairman of the Board. Consistent with Nasdaq listing requirements, the independent directors have regularly had the opportunity to meet without Mr. Kubacki and/or Mr. Findlay in attendance. In         2018, there were two such executive sessions.
In 2003, the Board created the position of a lead independent director. In 2012, the Board appointed M.         Scott Welch as lead independent director and he has continued to serve in that role. This appointment is reviewed annually by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The lead independent director assists the Board in assuring effective         corporate governance and serves as chairperson of the independent director sessions, and chairs Board meetings during any meetings or portions of meetings at which Mr. Kubacki is absent.
Code of Conduct
We have a code of conduct in place that applies to all of our directors and employees. The code sets         forth the standard of ethics that we expect all of our directors and employees to follow, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. The code of conduct is posted in the Investor Relations section of our         website at www.lakecitybank.com. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements under Item 10 of Form 8-K regarding any amendment to or waiver of the code with respect to our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and         persons performing similar functions, by posting such information on our website.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its         success. We face a number of risks, including general economic risks, credit risks, regulatory risks, audit risks, reputational risks and others, such as risks related to the unintentional effects our compensation plan may have on employee         decision-making or the impact of competition. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the Company faces, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In         its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed.
While the full Board of Directors is charged with ultimate oversight responsibility for risk         management, various committees of the Board and members of management also have responsibilities with respect to our risk oversight. In particular, the Audit Committee plays a large role in monitoring and assessing our financial, legal, and         operational risks, and receives regular reports from the management team's senior risk officer regarding comprehensive organizational risk as well as particular areas of concern. The Board's Compensation Committee monitors and assesses the various         risks associated with compensation policies and oversees incentive plans to ensure a reasonable and manageable level of risk-taking consistent with our overall strategy. In 2013, Lake City Bank established a Corporate Risk Committee of its Board to         oversee the risk management practices of Lake City Bank, including management's ability to assess and manage the Company's credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, legal and compliance, reputational, technology, operational trust and fiduciary         wealth advisory risks. In addition, the Corporate Risk Committee provides a forum for open and regular communication between senior management and the Board in order to effectively manage risks. The Corporate Risk Committee meets         quarterly. 
In addition, the Company has designated Ms. Kristin L. Pruitt, Executive Vice President, Chief         Administrative Officer and General Counsel, as its senior risk officer. Ms. Pruitt generally oversees management's role in its risk management practices, and she is invited to and generally attends all Board and committee meetings. Additionally,         Michael E. Gavin, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, is directly responsible for overseeing credit risk.
We believe that establishing the right "tone at the top" and providing for full and open communication         between management and the Board of Directors is essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our executive management meets regularly with our other senior officers to discuss strategy and risks facing the Company. Senior officers attend         many of the Board meetings, or, if not in attendance, are available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management-related issues and any other matters. The Board has an annual offsite meeting with senior management to         discuss strategies, key challenges, and risks and opportunities for the Company. Additionally, each of our Board-level committees provides regular reports to the full Board and apprises the Board of our comprehensive risk profile and any areas of         concern.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
During 2018, directors who were not employees of Lakeland Financial or Lake City Bank were paid the         following retainer fees:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Component      Amount    
 Annual Director Retainer     $   35,000    
 Annual Audit Committee Chairman Additional Retainer       15,000    
 Annual Lead Independent Director Additional Retainer       10,000    
 Annual Governance Committee Chairman Additional Retainer       10,000    
 Annual Compensation Committee Chairman Additional Retainer       10,000    
 Annual Corporate Risk Committee Chairman Additional Retainer       10,000    
 Annual Chairman of the Board Additional Retainer       40,000    
 Annual Stock Grant (number of shares)       1,300    
[END TABLE]
Each director of Lakeland Financial is also a director of Lake City Bank and is not compensated         separately for service on Lake City Bank's Board.
Mr. Findlay, who is a director and also serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, is not         paid any fees for his service as a director. The directors' fees are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee.
Under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, directors may be awarded non-qualified stock options or stock         grants at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, subject to an annual limitation for each director of 10,000 shares subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and 10,000 shares subject to stock awards. In 2019, each non-employee         director will receive 1,300 shares of Lakeland Financial stock upon approval by the Board of Directors.
Since 2011, the Board of Directors has maintained a stock ownership policy that currently requires         directors hold a minimum of 5,000 shares of Lakeland Financial within five years from either the adoption of the stock ownership policy or first becoming a director. At the time the ownership requirement was set at its current level, 5,000 shares         represented approximately the same value as five times the annual retainer for directors. This requirement will be reviewed each year by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and may be adjusted to maintain a similar ratio. As of         December 31, 2018, all of our non-employee directors met the requirements of our stock ownership policy. 
The following table provides information on 2018 compensation for non-employee directors who served         during 2018.

  (1)  We maintain the Lakeland Financial Corporation Directors Fee Deferral Plan under which non-employee directors are permitted to defer receipt of their                      directors' fees and earn a rate of return based upon the performance of our stock. The amounts shown in this column include amounts that may have been deferred by the directors. We may, but are not required to, fund the deferred fees                      into a trust which may hold our stock. The plan is unqualified and the directors have no interest in the trust. The deferred fees and any earnings thereon are unsecured obligations of Lakeland Financial. No director received                      preferential or above-market earnings on deferred compensation. Any shares held in the trust are treated as treasury shares and may not be voted on any matter presented to shareholders. The number of shares attributable to each director                      under the plan is set forth in the footnotes to the Beneficial Ownership Table below.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
During 2018, Lake City Bank had extended, and expects to continue to extend, loans to its directors and         officers and to their related interests. Such loans were, and will continue to be, made only upon the same terms, conditions, interest rates, and collateral requirements as those prevailing at the same time for comparable loans extended from time         to time to other, unrelated borrowers. Loans to directors and officers do not and will not involve greater risks of collectability, or present other unfavorable features, than loans to other borrowers. All such loans are approved by the Lake City         Bank Board of Directors in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements.
Lake City Bank entered into a Lease Agreement with Michigan Street, LLC for retail branch and office         space in South Bend, Indiana, in June 2011. In October 2011, Bradley Toothaker, a one-third owner of Michigan Street, LLC, joined the Boards of Directors of Lakeland Financial Corporation and Lake City Bank. The initial term of the lease is for a         period of 20 years, with two consecutive five-year renewal terms. Pursuant to the lease, monthly rent for 4,450 square feet of leased space was $6,304.16 for the first five years, and will increase by 7.5% every five years. In addition, Lake City         Bank is required to pay its proportionate share of common area maintenance fees for the building, presently expected to be approximately $3,184 per month. Mr. Toothaker had not yet become a director at the time of the lease signing and the Lease Agreement was negotiated by Lake City Bank's management on an         arms-length basis. Effective January 1, 2012, the parties amended the terms of the lease to reflect additional square footage to be used by Lake City Bank in the building. Based on the addition of approximately 550 square feet, the monthly rent for         the leased space increased to $7,001.87. This amendment was ratified by Lake City Bank's Board of Directors in February 2012. Management and the Board of Directors believe that the terms of the lease are reasonable and consistent with the customary         terms of the local market. As part of its annual review of director independence, the Board of Directors considered and re-evaluated this lease arrangement when considering Mr. Toothaker's independence and determined that it did not prevent Mr.         Toothaker from being able to serve as an independent director.
Additionally, pursuant to the Corporate Governance Committee Charter, the Nominating and Corporate         Governance Committee evaluates and pre-approves any non-lending, material transaction between Lakeland Financial and any director or officer. The charter does not provide any thresholds as to when a proposed transaction needs to be pre-approved,         but the committee evaluates those proposed transactions that may affect a director's independence or create a perception that the transaction was not fair to Lakeland Financial or not done at arm's length. Generally, transactions which would not         require disclosure in our proxy statement under SEC rules (without regard to the amount involved) do not require the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's pre-approval. A director may not participate in any discussion or approval by the         Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of any related party transaction with respect to which he or she is a related party, but must provide to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee all material information reasonably requested         concerning the transaction.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that our executive officers, directors         and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. They are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies         of such forms, and, if appropriate, representations made to us by any reporting person concerning whether a Form 5 was required to be filed for 2018, we are aware that one filing with respect to the exercise of restricted shares by Ms. Sarah Earls         was made late. Other than that one filing, we are not aware that any of our directors, executive officers or 10% shareholders failed to comply with the filing requirements of Section 16(a) during 2018.
PROPOSAL NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Shareholders will be entitled to elect 13 directors for a term expiring in 2020 at the annual meeting.
We have no knowledge that any nominee will refuse or be unable to serve, but if any of the nominees is         unavailable for election, the holders of the proxies reserve the right to substitute another person of their choice as a nominee when voting at the meeting.
Set forth below is information concerning the nominees for election, including the age, the year first         appointed or elected as a director and the other positions held by the person at Lakeland Financial and Lake City Bank. The nominees, if elected at the annual meeting, will serve as directors for a one-year term expiring in 2020. Each of the         nominees is an incumbent director and has served as a director of Lakeland Financial for at least one term with the exception of Ms. Christian, who was elected to the Board in October 2018.
The directors will be elected by a majority voting standard. Each vote is required to be counted "FOR,"         "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to the director's election. Consequently, to be elected as a director, the votes cast "FOR" a nominee's election must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" such nominee's election. Votes cast as "ABSTAIN"         with respect to the election of a director will have no effect in determining whether the required affirmative majority vote has been obtained. We           recommend that shareholders vote "FOR" each of the nominees for director. NOMINEES

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Introduction
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes Lakeland Financial's compensation philosophy and         policies for 2018 as applicable to the named executive officers as listed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. This section explains the structure and rationale associated with each material element of the executives' compensation, and it         provides important context for the more detailed disclosure tables and specific compensation amounts provided following the section.
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for evaluating the compensation plans, policies         and programs relating to the named executive officers of Lakeland Financial Corporation. The Compensation Committee relies upon Mr. Findlay's assessment of each executive officer's individual performance, which considers the executive's efforts in         achieving his or her individual goals each year, managing and developing employees and the enhancement of long-term relationships with customers, if applicable to his or her position. Individual goals for executive officers are established by Mr.         Findlay in consultation with each executive officer.
The Compensation Committee's charter gives it the authority to hire outside consultants to further its         objectives and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee did not retain an outside consultant to assess executive compensation in 2018. Instead, the Compensation Committee relied on the 2017 report of Pearl Meyer & Partners, a compensation         consulting firm, which assessed the effectiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs. Pearl Meyer & Partners is independent, reports directly to the committee chair, and performs no other work for the Company other than assisting         the committee in its review of the total compensation program. In its 2017 report, Pearl Meyer & Partners also provided input on marketplace trends and best practices relating to competitive pay levels, as well as developments in regulatory and         technical matters. The Compensation Committee also reviewed compensation survey data in 2018 from industry sources such as the American Bankers Association, Pearl Meyer & Partners and Bank Director Magazine. Regulatory Impact on Compensation
As a publicly-traded financial institution, we must contend with several often overlapping layers of         regulations when considering and implementing compensation-related decisions. These regulations do not set specific parameters within which compensation decisions must be made, but do require Lakeland Financial and the Compensation Committee to be         mindful of the risks that often go hand-in-hand with compensation programs designed to incentivize the achievement of better than average performance. While the regulatory focus on risk assessment has been heightened over the last several years,         the incorporation of general concepts of risk assessment into compensation decisions is not a recent development.
Under its Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") has long held that excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice. In         describing a framework to determine whether compensation is considered excessive, the FDIC has indicated that financial institutions should consider whether aggregate cash amounts paid, or noncash benefits provided, to employees are unreasonable or         disproportionate to the services performed by an employee. The FDIC encourages financial institutions to review an employee's compensation history and to consider internal pay equity, and, as appropriate, to consider benchmarking compensation to         peer groups. Finally, the FDIC provides that such an assessment must be made in light of the institution's overall financial condition.
In addition, the various financial institution regulatory agencies have jointly issued their Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which serves as a compliment to the Safety and Soundness standards. As its title would imply, the joint agency guidance sets forth a framework for assessing the soundness of incentive compensation plans, programs and arrangements         maintained by financial institutions. The joint agency guidance is narrower in scope than the Safety and Soundness standards because it         applies only to senior executive officers and those other individuals who, either alone or as a group, could pose a material risk to the institution. With respect to those identified individuals, the joint agency guidance is intended to focus the         institution's attention on balanced risk-taking incentives, compatibility with effective controls and risk management, with a focus on general principles of strong corporate governance.
In addition to the foregoing, we anticipate that currently proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act         intended to implement further risk assessment guidelines and procedures may eventually be finalized by the financial institution regulatory agencies and the SEC. We expect that we would be subject to those further guidelines and procedures should         they be finalized and become effective. Initial proposed guidance with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act risk assessment guidelines and procedures was issued in 2011 and revised and re-proposed in 2016. Depending on when the rules are finalized, the         earliest they could apply to Lakeland Financial is for performance periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021. In large part, that guidance restates the frameworks set forth in the Safety and Soundness standards and joint agency guidance described above.
Also, as a publicly-traded corporation, Lakeland Financial is also subject to the SEC's rules regarding         risk assessment. Those rules require a publicly-traded company to determine whether any of its existing incentive compensation plans, programs or arrangements, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the         company. We do not believe that our incentive compensation plans, programs or arrangements create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Lakeland Financial.
The Compensation Committee believes that a sensible approach to balancing risk-taking and rewarding         reasonable, but not necessarily easily attainable, goals has always been a component of its overall assessment of the compensation plans, programs and arrangements it has established for Lakeland Financial's named executive officers. In this         regard, the committee has revisited the components of the frameworks set forth in the Safety and Soundness standards and the joint agency         guidance as an effective tool for conducting its own assessment of the balance between risk and reward built into Lakeland Financial's compensation         programs for named executive officers. In addition, the committee continues to monitor the status of proposed guidance under the Dodd-Frank Act and will be prepared to incorporate into its risk assessment procedures any new guidelines and         procedures as may be necessary or appropriate. 
In making decisions about executive compensation, in addition to the above, we also consider the impact         of other regulatory provisions, including: the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code that may limit the deductibility of certain compensation unless it is considered performance-based and is paid pursuant to a written binding contract which was         in effect prior to November 2, 2017 and which has not subsequently been materially modified; Section 409A of the Code regarding nonqualified deferred compensation; and Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code regarding excise taxes and deduction         limitations on golden parachute payments made in connection with a change in control. In making decisions about executive compensation, we also consider how various elements of compensation will impact our financial results. For example, we         consider the impact of FASB ASC Topic 718, which requires us to recognize the compensation costs of grants of equity awards based upon the grant date fair value of those awards.
Compensation-Related Governance Policies
Share Ownership Guidelines. The guidelines, adopted in 2015, require the Chief Executive Officer to hold a minimum number of shares of Company common stock with a value equal to three times his annual base salary and other executive         officers, including each of the named executive officers, to hold a minimum number of shares of Company common stock with a value equal to two times his or her respective annual base salary. Unvested options or restricted stock units issued under         the Company's LTI Plan are not included when considering ownership totals for this requirement. In the event that an executive officer does not hold the required number of shares, a minimum of one-half of shares issued under the LTI Plan must be         retained until the guidelines are met. As of the most recent measurement date, all of our named executive officers were in compliance with the share ownership guidelines.
Insider Trading Policy. The Company has an insider trading policy that permits open market transactions in Company         stock beginning two trading days after quarterly earnings have been made public until the two weeks before the last day of the quarter end.
Hedging and Pledging Policy. The Company's insider trading policy includes provisions that specifically prohibit         our insiders from entering into hedging transactions involving the Company's stock. To our knowledge, none of our officers or directors has entered into a hedging transaction involving Company stock in violation of this prohibition. The Company's         insider trading policy also prohibits an insider from pledging Company stock as collateral for a lending relationship without the prior approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. To our knowledge, none of our officers or         directors has pledged his or her Company stock in violation of this policy.
Assessment of Compensation Risk
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with         management.
  The Compensation Committee in 2018 completed its thorough annual review of all compensation         programs offered at Lakeland Financial and Lake City Bank, including those described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, to determine whether any aspect of the plans or programs encourages excessive or unnecessary risk that would         adversely affect the long-term value or performance of Lakeland Financial. Based on the risk assessment process, which is more fully described below, the committee concluded that the compensation plans and programs, considered individually and as a         whole, do not encourage excessive risk taking and are designed to encourage and reward decisions that create long-term shareholder value in a manner consistent with the Company's core values. The senior risk officer compiled an inventory of the design features of all incentive compensation         plans and programs for purposes of assessing the potential for encouraging excessive or unnecessary risk-taking that could threaten the value of the enterprise and presented this to the Compensation Committee. The committee then considered how the         structure of each plan or program impacted risk-taking of plan participants. In addition, the committee examined Lakeland Financial's compensation plans and programs in light of recent incentive compensation failures in the market place.
In analyzing the risks inherent in the Company's annual bonus plan, the Compensation Committee         determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Bonus amounts are tied to financial performance and personal performance against individualized goals, including                    non-financial goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Threshold goals are reasonably achievable with good performance and are sufficiently challenging but not overly                    difficult.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Payouts are interpolated based on percentage of net income achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Reasonable bonus maximums exist as part of an overall balanced pay mix.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to the LTI Plan as described under the Long-Term Incentive Plan section below, the         committee concluded that the plan was well designed to align the Company's strategic objectives with long-term value creation for the following reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Performance metrics factor in risk of capital and measures that take into consideration balance sheet, income                    statement and equity factors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Threshold goals are reasonably achievable with good performance and are sufficiently challenging but not overly                    difficult. The LTI Plan does not include steep cliffs for not achieving goals nor exponential upside for achieving them. Reasonable leverage exists above threshold goals to achieve maximum payouts.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Incentives are capped at reasonable levels.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Maximum awards are an appropriate portion of total pay.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The three-year performance period discourages measures that do not benefit the Company over the long term.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Denomination in Company stock gives incentive to focus on sustained value creation, and further alignment with                    shareholder interests.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee completed similar analyses for the other compensation programs available to         employees, and concluded that the amounts provided under such programs are reasonable as part of a balanced pay mix and appropriately incentivize performance without encouraging the manipulation of earnings, other performance metrics, or other         improper behavior in order to enhance the benefits payable under such programs.
The Compensation Committee then reviewed the executive compensation structure overall and reached the         following conclusions, based on the following key risk categories:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Strategic Risk:  The Compensation Committee determined that overall, the performance metrics used are aligned with the Company's strategy and                      objectives for long-term value creation for our shareholders, properly reward various performance outcomes, and account for risk over a longer-term time horizon.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Cultural Risk:  Lakeland Financial has a strong set of corporate values that emphasize ethical behavior, actions that contribute to building                    long-term value rather than short-term performance, teamwork and investment in people and infrastructure. Our senior executives have little incentive to be overly focused on short-term stock price performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Governance Risk:                                         The Compensation Committee is independent, has access to consultants and other advisers independent of management, has an appropriate level of expertise and is fully educated on all significant incentive plans and programs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Pay-Mix Risk:                                         Lakeland Financial has market-competitive salaries to reduce pressure on short-term performance to earn reasonable annual compensation. The Compensation Committee believes the mix between longer-term incentives is appropriately balanced                    with motivation for short-term performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Performance                      Measurement Risk:  The Compensation Committee has a disciplined process of establishing goals for and evaluating the performance of Mr. Findlay in executive sessions. Financial performance measures consider the income statement,                    balance sheet and statement of cash flows so that management is accountable for all aspects of Lakeland Financial's financial health. The Company considers both financial and non-financial performance outcomes in assessing executives'                    performance and compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Annual                      Incentive Risk:  Executives' annual bonuses are earned based on both financial performance and non-financial performance. Goals for achieving target bonuses are reasonably achievable with good performance. The Compensation                    Committee believes the goals are challenging, but not overly difficult. The bonus payout curves do not use steep cliffs for target bonus or exponential payouts for maximum payouts.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Long-Term                      Incentive Risk:  The LTI Plan uses different performance metrics and measurement periods than annual incentives so that short-term performance is not overemphasized. Restricted stock units under the LTI Plan do not use overly                    stretched goals or accelerated payout curves. The target and maximum payouts under the LTI Plan are reasonable in light of our overall pay mix. Long-term incentives focus on measures of sustainable value creation for long-term investors.  
[END TABLE]
Conclusion
After considering all components of the compensation paid to the named executive officers, the         Compensation Committee has determined that the compensation is reasonable and not excessive, and does not encourage imprudent risk-taking or other improper behavior.
In making this determination, the Compensation Committee considered many factors, including the         following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Management has positioned Lakeland Financial for future success through the planning and                    execution of Lakeland Financial's strategic plan.  
· Management has consistently led Lakeland Financial to strong levels of performance in                    recent years.  
· The shareholder return performance of Lakeland Financial over the past five years has                    outpaced the performance of companies in Lakeland Financial's peer group.  
· Lakeland Financial is well positioned in the communities it serves as a result of the direction that this                    management team has taken the Company.

Consideration of 2018 Say on Pay
At the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, more than 97% of the votes cast were in favor of         the non-binding advisory proposal on the compensation of certain executive officers. The Company, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee pay careful attention to communications received from shareholders regarding executive         compensation, including the non-binding advisory vote. The Company carefully considered the result of the 2018 advisory vote on executive compensation but not for specific compensation decisions. Based on this consideration and the other factors         described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the committee did not materially alter the policies or structure for the named executive officers' compensation for 2018 or 2019. Compensation Factors
General. The Compensation Committee's decisions regarding each named executive officer are based, in part, on the committee's subjective judgment, and also take into account qualitative and quantitative factors, as will be set forth in         the discussion below. In reviewing an executive officer's compensation, the committee considers and evaluates all components of the officer's total compensation package.
Corporate Performance. In establishing executive compensation, the Compensation Committee measures Lakeland Financial's performance compared to management's and the Board's goals and objectives, and also compares our performance to         that of our peer group of financial institutions. The committee believes that using Lakeland Financial's performance as a factor when determining an executive officer's compensation is effective in helping to align the executive's interests with         those of our shareholders. With that in mind, the committee focuses on performance versus key financial performance criteria, such as return on beginning equity, return on average assets, revenue growth, diluted earnings per share growth, capital         adequacy, the efficiency ratio and asset quality. As part of the evaluation and review of these criteria, the committee will also take into account various subjective issues, such as general economic conditions, including the interest rate         environment and its impact on performance, and how they may affect Lakeland Financial's performance.
For purposes of peer analysis in assessing performance, Lakeland Financial generally considers peer         groups that include commercial banks of similar asset size, financial performance and organizational structure as well as those that are key competitors for executive talent. Given the ever-changing landscape within the banking industry, there is         no specifically defined group of banks that are utilized for this analysis. In connection with its 2017 analysis of the Company's executive compensation programs, Pearl Meyer & Partners compiled a market reference group of 20 other         publicly-traded bank holding companies headquartered in the central United States, with median assets of $4.7 billion, median market capitalization of $867 million and stable, if not strong, performance history. The Compensation Committee believes         that the peer group remains appropriate for the 2018 analysis. The companies included in this peer group are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Old National Bancorp – Evansville, Indiana   First Financial Bancorp – Cincinnati, Ohio  
 Park National Corporation – Newark, Ohio   First Commonwealth Financial Corp. – Indiana, Pennsylvania  
 Heartland Financial – Dubuque, Iowa   1st Source Corporation – South Bend, Indiana  
 Community Trust Bancorp – Pikeville, Kentucky   First Busey – Champaign, Illinois  
 First Merchants Corporation – Muncie, Indiana   Peoples Bancorp – Marietta, Ohio  
 Enterprise Financial Services – St. Louis, Missouri   Republic Bancorp – Louisville, Kentucky  
 Midland States Bancorp – Effingham, Illinois   Stock Yards Bancorp – Louisville, Kentucky  
 Tristate Capital Holdings, Inc – Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania   German American – Jasper, Indiana  
 Horizon Bancorp – Michigan City, Indiana   MidWestOne Financial – Iowa City, Iowa  
 QCR Holdings, Inc – Moline, Illinois   Mercantile Bank Corporation – Grand Rapids, Michigan  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation survey data that is readily available to         Lakeland Financial from industry sources such as Bank Director Magazine and the American Bankers Association.
Our compensation decisions for 2018 and for 2019 factored in Lakeland Financial's performance versus         key financial criteria, including return on beginning equity, return on average assets, revenue growth, diluted earnings per share growth, capital adequacy, efficiency ratio and asset quality. The committee believes that Lakeland Financial's         financial performance in 2018 was very strong. When compared to its peer group, the Compensation Committee believes Lakeland Financial's performance was good and, therefore, the committee weighed heavily Lakeland Financial's relative performance         when compared to its peers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee determined that the named executive officers performed well versus their individual goals for 2018.
Other factors of corporate performance that may affect an executive's compensation include succession         planning consideration, realization of economies of scale through cost-saving measures, Lakeland Financial's market share reputation in the communities which it serves and turnover level of employees, as well as other less subjective performance         considerations. In addition, because the Compensation Committee believes strongly that our executives should be involved in the communities that we serve, the committee takes into consideration indirect and intangible business factors such as         community involvement and leadership when reviewing executive compensation. Comparison to Peer Group. In establishing the compensation of the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee utilizes market data regarding the compensation practices of other financial institutions of a similar asset size and         complexity. The peer group used in 2017, which was relied upon for 2018 compensation decisions, generally included financial institutions with total assets of $3.0 billion to $15.1 billion, with a focus on institutions located in the central region         of the United States. In some cases, however, the committee will consider data from outside the peer comparison when reviewing compensation practices if that comparison identifies similarities, such as business-line focus and long-term operating         and financial stability, which should be considered. For example, institutions with a similar focus on complex commercial lending may be considered by the committee even if they fall outside of the general asset size in which our other peers are         included. The committee believes that such comparison is useful in creating an overall compensation program to stay competitive in the marketplace and for attracting and retaining qualified executives. While the committee believes that it is         prudent to consider such comparative information in determining compensation practices, it does not set strict parameters using this data. Rather, the committee uses comparative data to ensure that executive compensation is not inconsistent with         appropriately defined peer organizations. Generally, the committee believes that the current executive officers of the Company have established a sound track record of long-term performance that warrants compensation at or around the median level         of compensation among similarly situated financial institutions.
Individual Performance. When evaluating an executive officer's individual performance, the Compensation Committee takes into account Mr. Findlay's assessment of individual performance, which considers the executive's efforts         in achieving his or her individual goals each year, managing and developing employees and the enhancement of long-term relationships with customers, if applicable to the officer's position. The measure of an executive officer's individual         performance and individual contribution to the overall Company performance depends, to a degree, on what steps are taken to increase revenues and implement cost-saving strategies and the outcome of such strategies. Each executive officer has         different goals established that are intended to focus that executive's contributions to the strategic goals of the Company. Individual goals for executive officers are developed by Mr. Findlay in consultation with each executive officer and         recommended to the committee by Mr. Findlay for approval. The committee establishes Mr. Findlay's goals after reviewing the Company's annual strategic plan, annual budget plan and the goals of the other executive officers. Mr. Findlay is not         present for the discussion or determination of his own compensation.
Compensation Decisions
This section describes the decisions made by the Compensation Committee with respect to the         compensation for the named executive officers for 2018 and 2019.
Executive Summary. In reviewing         an executive officer's compensation, the Compensation Committee considers and evaluates all components of the officer's total compensation package through the use of tally sheets. The use of tally sheets allows the committee to assess the         executive's aggregate compensation, including cash payments and non-cash incentives and benefits, in one concise document. The chart below summarizes the major elements of executive officer compensation.

Our compensation decisions for 2018 and for 2019 factored in Lakeland Financial's performance versus         key financial criteria, including return on beginning equity, return on average assets, revenue growth, diluted earnings per share growth, capital adequacy, efficiency ratio and asset quality. The committee believes that Lakeland Financial's         financial performance in 2018 was very strong. When compared to its peer group, the Compensation Committee believes Lakeland Financial's performance was good and, therefore, the committee weighed heavily Lakeland Financial's relative performance         when compared to its peers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee determined that the named executive officers performed well versus their individual goals for 2018.
The following is a brief summary of additional compensation decisions of the Compensation Committee for         2019 and 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· bonus payments to named executive officers for 2018 were lower than bonuses for 2017 due to performance of                    Lakeland Financial in 2018 against its target;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the 2019 LTI Plan target level grants were generally unchanged and were increased slightly for Ms. Pruitt to                    align the grants with a percentage of base salary consistent with the other executive officers and to reflect increased responsibilities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the amount of total compensation paid to Mr. Findlay was higher due to his strong performance as Chief Executive                    Officer for the reasons stated above.  
[END TABLE]
 Base Salary. The salaries for 2018, determined by the Compensation Committee at the end of 2017, are set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. In determining these salary levels, we considered the following factors, with         no specific weighting applied to any single factor:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the compensation philosophy and guiding principles described above;  
· the performance of Lakeland Financial versus key financial objectives;  
· the base salary paid to the officers in comparable positions at companies in the peer                    groups, generally using the median of total compensation as our point of reference if the officer's overall performance and experience warrants such consideration;  
· the overall professional experience and background and the industry knowledge of the named                    executive officers and the quality and effectiveness of their leadership at Lakeland Financial;  
· all of the other components of executive compensation, including bonus, stock awards,                    retirement and death benefits, as well as other benefits and perquisites;  
· the performance of Lakeland Financial's stock price, although it is not a key factor in                    considering compensation as the committee believes that the performance of the stock price is subject to factors outside the control of executive management; and  
· internal pay equity among Lakeland Financial executives.

At the end of 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the base salaries of the         named executive officers for 2019. The committee approved raises for all of the named executive officers for 2019 based on the factors described above. The base salaries for 2018 and 2019 are set forth below.

 The           measure of the Company performance is based on our actual net income for that year compared to the targeted net income. We calculate this by using our net income after the 401(k) match and incentive compensation costs. The Compensation Committee           approves a targeted net income amount after reviewing the previous year's actual net income in conjunction with the Board's and management's expectations for that particular year. The target net income amount is generally increased each         year in order to provide a proper level of incentive to the officers and, in the committee's view, is not at a level that makes it substantially certain that the target threshold will be obtained. The Company performance payout percentage is         determined based upon achieving certain performance levels of net income as defined in the table below. The Company employs linear interpolation to determine the payout percentage in the event that actual net income falls between 70% and 90% of         target, while the payout percentage is the actual percentage of target net income attained when actual net income falls at or above 90% of target, up to the maximum of 150%.

The actual net income used for bonus calculation 2018 was $80,411,000, or 102% of the targeted amount,         and bonuses with respect to Company performance were, therefore, paid out at that same level. Individual bonus payments under this plan are determined further by the formulas described below, although the Compensation Committee reserves the right         to modify the payouts in its sole discretion.
The Company performance payout percentage may be further adjusted based on the executive's individual         performance. The measure of individual performance is determined on the individual's overall performance compared to the individual's performance goals that are discussed in the beginning of the year by the individual and the other executives. The         Compensation Committee also has the discretion to reward achievements that are not the subject of any pre-established goals. The committee determined that the named executive officers performed well against their respective individual performance         goals in 2018. The percent of eligible salary and individual performance payout percentages for each named executive officer are listed in the table below.

 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Company maintains an Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTI Plan"). The plan is designed to provide for performance-based payouts based upon key financial criteria over rolling three-year         periods, which are recommended by Mr. Findlay and approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has made grants under the LTI Plan each year since the plan was implemented in 2006. At the discretion of the Committee, awards         under the LTI Plan consist of performance based restricted stock units rather than cash to provide for additional alignment with shareholders and stock price performance over the performance period. Shares delivered pursuant to the LTI Plan are         currently granted under the shareholder approved 2017 Equity Incentive Plan.
The purpose of the LTI Plan is to motivate select officers, including our named executive officers, to         collectively produce outstanding results, encourage superior performance, increase productivity and aid in attracting and retaining key employees. Mr. Findlay recommends, subject to the Compensation Committee's approval, the performance measures         and performance targets to be used for each performance period and the LTI bonus to be paid if certain required conditions are met. The Committee currently utilizes three key financial measures: revenue growth rate, diluted earnings per share         growth rate and average return on beginning equity. Performance targets can be based on a combination of Lakeland Financial's goals, business unit and/or individual goals or on such other factors that the committee may determine and approve.         Different performance targets may be established for different participants for any performance period, although currently all executives have the same performance targets.
Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, a new three-year performance period will begin         each year under the LTI Plan. Thus, the maximum number of performance periods open to measurement at any time is three. Executive officers receive earned LTI Plan payouts on a yearly basis at the conclusion of each successive three-year performance         period. The committee believes that, by making annual awards that consider Company performance over rolling three-year periods, the Committee is incentivizing our named executive officers to focus on consistent and sustainable performance rather         than taking outsized risk in any one particular year.
The amount of the LTI bonus awarded for each performance period is based upon achieving certain         performance levels for each of the three measurement criteria as defined in the tables below. The Company employs linear interpolation to determine the payout in the event a measurement criterion falls between the threshold and target, or target         and maximum, performance levels.

The Compensation Committee directed management to accrue for the open periods at an amount equal to the         sum of the percentages of the actual financial performance against the targeted performance levels, with each of the three criteria valued at 33.33% of the total accrual.
The Compensation Committee generally kept the grant amounts the same as the prior year's grants for the         LTI Plan grants for 2019, but determined that Ms. Pruitt's share grant should be increased to maintain the LTI grant value at a similar percentage of salary to the other management committee members and to reflect her increased responsibilities as         Chief Administrative Officer. This action was taken to ensure that the equity compensation is fair to both participants and the Company's shareholders.
The LTI Plan allows the Compensation Committee, at its discretion, to adjust performance goals and         performance measure results for extraordinary events or accounting adjustments resulting from significant asset purchases or dispositions or other events not contemplated or otherwise considered by the committee when the performance measures and         targets were set. For the LTI Plan period ending in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that it should exclude the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
For the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018, awards were paid at 142% of target, for         a total of 126,200 shares paid to 39 individuals in accordance with the terms of the LTI Plan. The performance metrics and actual results for the 2016-2018 performance period were as follows:

Equity Awards. The foregoing LTI awards are granted in the form of performance-based restricted stock units under our equity incentive plan. No other stock-based awards were issued in 2018 to the named executive officers under our         2017 Equity Incentive Plan, as set forth on the 2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table.
All Other Compensation and Perquisites. While the Compensation Committee reviews and monitors the level of other compensation offered to the named executive officers, the committee typically does not adjust the level of benefits offered         on an annual basis. The committee does consider the benefits and perquisites offered to the named executive officers in its evaluation of the total compensation received by each. It is our belief that perquisites for executive officers should be         very limited in scope and value and reflective of similar perquisites from competitive employers both in the industry and the region. Due to this philosophy, Lakeland Financial has generally provided nominal benefits to executives that are not         available to all full-time employees and we plan to continue this approach in the future. The benefits offered in 2018 to the named executive officers will continue for 2019. The perquisites received by the named executive officers in 2018 are         reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.
Change in Control Agreements. The Company has change in control agreements with each of Messrs. Findlay, Ottinger         and Deardorff and Messes. O'Neill and Pruitt. The change in control agreements are discussed more fully in the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control section below.

  (1)  Salary reported includes amounts deferred at the officer's election pursuant to the Company's deferred compensation plans.  
  (2)  For 2018, represents the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted                        under our LTI Plan for the 2018-2020 performance period. For 2017, represents such grant date fair value for performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted under our LTI Plan for the 2017-2019 performance period. For 2016,                        represents such grant date fair value for performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted under our LTI Plan for the 2016-2018 performance period. Because the currently outstanding restricted stock units do not pay or                        accumulate dividend equivalents during the three-year vesting period, these amounts were calculated based on the Company's closing share price on the date of grant discounted by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid                        on the underlying shares during the vesting period. Expected dividends are calculated using the most recent dividend rate declared by the Board of Directors on the grant date. The Company uses a discount rate equal to the 3 year                        Treasury rate on the grant date. See the discussion of equity awards in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Lakeland Financial's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further                        information regarding these awards.

  (1)  Although Mr. Deardorff has 28 years of actual service with the Company, he has only 10 years of service credit as the plan was frozen with respect to future                      benefit accruals in 2000.

  (2)  See the discussion of pension and other post retirement plans in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Lakeland Financial's financial                      statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further information regarding the valuation method and material assumptions applied in quantifying the present value of the accumulated benefit.  
[END TABLE]
Our defined benefit retirement plan covers certain employees over 21 years of age with more than one         year of service. Effective April 1, 2000, we amended the plan to freeze the accrual of benefits to participants under the plan. As a result of this amendment, employees who were not participants in the plan as of March 31, 2000 are not able to         become participants under the plan. In addition, all benefits previously accrued under the plan by participants were frozen in place, and continuing employment with us will not increase the employee's benefits upon retirement. Normal retirement age         is 65. Participants received credit for 2 1/2% of their average salary for each year up to 20 years of service or through March 31, 2000, whichever occurred first. The principal benefit under this plan is a lifetime annuity for the joint lives of participants and         their spouses. This amount is offset by social security benefits. On December 31, 1985, the then existing plan was terminated and the latest plan (which is now frozen) was adopted effective January 1, 1986. Participants in the terminated plan were         paid cash or received annuities for their earned benefits as of December 31, 1985. The amounts paid for annuities purchased as a part of the plan termination will reduce the benefits to be paid out of the latest plan.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Effective January 1, 2004, we adopted the Lake City Bank Deferred Compensation Plan. The purpose of the         plan is to provide an option for salary deferrals at the participant's voluntary election for certain individuals without regard to statutory limitations under tax qualified plans. The plan is available to all of our executive officers. The plan is         funded solely by participant contributions and does not receive a Company match. Participants may defer a portion of their salary or bonus under         the plan. Deferred amounts are tracked by the Company in a deferral account. The Company will credit earnings and losses to the participant's deferred account based on the performance of one or more measurements funds selected by the participant         from a pool of measurement funds selected by the Compensation Committee. The participant's deferred account balance will be distributed in a lump sum following the participant's termination of employment or death. Participants may elect to receive         the funds in a lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments following retirement on or after the participant's attainment of age 55 and 10 years of service, but may not make withdrawals during their employment, except in the event of a financial         hardship as approved by the Compensation Committee, or if the participant makes an in service distribution election prior to the time of the deferral in accordance with the terms of the plan. All deferral elections and associated distribution         schedules are irrevocable. Earnings or losses on deferrals are the result of market performance of the selected investments.

 (5)   With respect to Mr. Deardorff, $50,976 of the 2018 contributions were reported in the                    Summary Compensation Table as non-equity incentive compensation. The 2018 aggregate earnings were not considered above market interest, and as such, were not reported in the Summary Compensation Table. $90,140 of the aggregate balance as                    of December 31, 2018 was reported as compensation to the executive in the Summary Compensation Table in previous years.  
[END TABLE]
As noted above, all contributions to the plan are funded solely by voluntary participant contributions,         which represent a deferral of annual salary or non-equity incentive compensation, and there are no Company matching contributions. All aggregate earnings shown above represent investment and interest return on participant contributions.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following table sets forth information concerning potential payments and benefits under our         compensation programs and benefit plans to which the named executive officers would be entitled upon a hypothetical termination of employment as of December 31, 2018. As is more fully described below, all of the named executive officers were         subject to change in control agreements with Lakeland Financial that were in effect on December 31, 2018 (each, a "Change in Control Agreement"), which provide for payments and benefits to a terminating executive following a change in control of         Lakeland Financial. Except for the payments and benefits provided by the Change in Control Agreements, all other payments and benefits provided to any named executive officer upon termination of his employment are the same as the payments and         benefits provided to other eligible executives of Lakeland Financial. For purposes of estimating the value of certain equity awards, we have assumed a price per share of           our common stock of $40.16, which was the closing price of our stock on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Amounts set forth are gross amounts payable in connection with a change in control and are subject to a modified 280G cutback provision, which may result in a                      reduced payment being made to the named executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (2)   A prorated vesting of LTI Plan awards is due to a participant under the LTI Plan when such participant's                    employment is terminated by reason of his or her retirement. All LTI Plan awards become fully vested at target performance upon the participant's death or disability. On a termination in connection with a change in control, outstanding                    LTI Plan awards vest at target performance in accordance with the 2013 and 2017 Equity Incentive Plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (3)   Unless an executive is employed on the date on which bonuses are paid under the Executive Incentive Bonus Plan,                    he or she will not receive any payment thereunder. The only exceptions to this rule are that a prorated bonus is payable to a participant under the Executive Incentive Bonus Plan when such participant retires prior to the date of payment                    and that a bonus for any completed performance period is payable to a participant on a termination in connection with a change in control. For purposes of the table above, it is assumed that each executive's employment terminated on                    December 31, 2018 and therefore the above table includes the full 2018 bonus amounts.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  Since our medical and dental benefit plans are self-funded, we have estimated the amounts due for 18 months of medical and dental benefits based on our                      monthly COBRA continuation rates.  
[END TABLE]
 Accrued Pay, Certain Retirement Benefits and Vested Equity Awards. The amounts shown in         the table above do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to salaried employees generally upon termination of employment, or amounts that are fully vested under the terms of the applicable         plan. These include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Accrued salary and vacation pay.  
· Regular pension benefits under our defined benefit retirement plan. See                    "2018 Pension Benefits" above.  
· Distributions of plan balances under our 401(k) plan and the Lake City Bank Deferred Compensation Plan (the                    "Deferred Compensation Plan"). See "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" above for information on current account balances and an overview of the Deferred Compensation Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Disability, Death and Retirement. A termination of employment due to disability does not entitle the named         executive officers to any payments or benefits that are not available to salaried employees generally. As is the case with any other eligible participant under our LTI Plan (as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above),         termination of employment due to retirement will entitle the named executive officers to a prorated payout under such plan. In addition, as is also the case with any other eligible participant under our Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (as described         in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above), termination of employment due to retirement will entitle the named executive officers to a prorated bonus under such plan. All employees, including the named executive officers, who receive awards         under our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan will immediately vest in any unvested awards held by such employee in the event of a termination due to disability or death.
Acceleration of Vesting Upon a Change in Control. All employees, including the named executive officers, who         receive awards under our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan will immediately vest in any unvested awards held by such employee if (1) the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and the respective         award agreements are not fully assumed in a change in control or (2) the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and the respective award agreements are fully assumed in the change in control and the employee is terminated by         the Company without cause or the employee resigns for good reason.
Change in Control Agreements. Other than as is provided in the Change in Control Agreements, and except as is         provided in accordance with the terms of our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, no named executive officer will be entitled to any payments or benefits as a result of the occurrence of a change in control or as a result         of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control.
In the case of a termination of employment by the Company without cause, or by the executive for good         reason, within 6 months prior to, or 24 months immediately following, a change in control, the Change in Control Agreements provide for the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Payment, in a single lump sum, of a severance benefit equal to two times the sum of (i) the greater of the                    executive's then current base salary or the executive's annual base salary as of the date one day prior to the change in control and (ii) the greater of the executive's target annual performance bonus or the amount of the average annual                    performance bonus paid (or payable) to the executive for the most recently completed three fiscal years of the Company prior to the year in which the termination of employment occurs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· To the extent the executive (or any of the executive's dependents) was eligible to be covered under the terms of                    our medical and dental plans for active employees immediately prior to his or her termination date, we will provide the executive (and his dependents, if any), at the Company's cost, with equivalent coverages for up to 18 months following                    termination of employment, provided the executive elects COBRA coverage. In the event that the executive (and/or his or her dependents, if any) become eligible for coverage under the terms of any other medical and/or dental plan of a                    subsequent employer which plan benefits are comparable to our plan benefits, coverage under our plans will cease for the executive (and/or his or her dependents, if any).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Payment of any earned but unpaid salary for the period ending on the termination date, any earned but unpaid                    annual performance bonus for performance periods completed before the termination date, any accrued but unpaid vacation, and any unreimbursed business expenses.  
[END TABLE]
The change in control benefits described above are subject to a modified 280G cutback provision which         provides for a reduction in payments to the extent that such reduction would confer a greater after-tax benefit to the executive after taking into account all income, employment and excise taxes.
The Company entered into revised Change in Control Agreements with the named executive officers         effective March 1, 2016 that, among other things, modified the "double-trigger" provision described above, conditioned the receipt of the change in control payment on the executive's execution of a release and waiver of claims against the Company,         and increased the geographic scope (but reduced the duration) of the non-compete covenant described below.
In exchange for the payments and benefits provided under the Change in Control Agreements, the         executives agree to be bound by a one-year restrictive covenant, which will be effective throughout the geographic area within a 60-mile radius from the location of any office of the Company operating at the time of the executive's termination of         employment. The restrictive covenant will prohibit the executive from competing, in any way, with the Company for the one-year period following the executive's termination of employment.
CEO Pay Ratio
We calculated our median employee as of December 31, 2018 payroll using our entire employee population.         The compensation we used to determine our median employee was the same as that used in the summary compensation table for our named executive officers, including our CEO, with the exception of any positive pension earnings. As previously discussed,         our pension plan was frozen in 2000 therefore this benefit is not available to employees hired since the plan was frozen, including our CEO. This information is also not practicably available for the entire employee population. We annualized the         salary of full-time employees hired during the year and the salary of part-time permanent employees hired during the year was annualized at their part-time rate. For 2018, we used the same median employee as used for 2017 as there have been no         material changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change to the pay ratio. There were no material changes to this employee's compensation that would significantly affect         the pay ratio. Based on this methodology, the total compensation of our median employee was $38,449. The total compensation of our CEO was $1,604,172 and the ratio of this to our median employee was 42:1.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation
Lakeland Financial seeks to maximize the tax deductibility of all elements of compensation. Section         162(m) of the Code will generally disallow a corporate tax deduction for compensation paid to certain officers in excess of $1 million, unless the compensation meets an exception as performance-based compensation and is paid pursuant to a written         binding contract which was in effect prior to November 2, 2017 and which has not subsequently been materially modified. While we try to structure compensation plans and programs to ensure deductibility, we may approve compensation amounts that do         not qualify for deductibility when we deem it to be in the best interest of Lakeland Financial. 
PROPOSAL NO. 2 - ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE         COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as created by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall         Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder require publicly traded companies, such as Lakeland Financial Corporation, to permit a separate shareholder vote to approve the         compensation of executives as disclosed pursuant to the compensation rules of the SEC. In accordance with these requirements, we are providing shareholders with an advisory vote on the compensation of our executive officers at the 2019 annual         meeting.
As described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy         statement, the overall objectives of Lakeland Financial's compensation programs have been to align executive officer compensation with the success of meeting long-term strategic operating and financial goals. Shareholders are urged to read the         Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables and narrative disclosure that describe the compensation of our named executive officers in 2018.         The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and achieving its goals, and         that the compensation of our executive officers in fiscal year 2018 reflects and supports these compensation policies and procedures.
The following resolution is submitted for shareholder approval:
"RESOLVED, that Lakeland Financial Corporation's shareholders approve, on an         advisory basis, its executive compensation as described in the section captioned 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' and the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation under 'Executive Compensation' contained in the         Company's proxy statement, dated February 28, 2019."
Approval of this resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted on this         matter at the annual meeting. While this advisory vote on executive compensation, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" advisory vote, is required, it is not binding on our Board of Directors and may not be construed as overruling any decision by         the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation arrangements.
The Board of Directors recommends shareholders vote to approve the overall         compensation of our named executive officers by voting "FOR" this proposal. Proxies properly signed and returned will be voted "FOR" this proposal unless shareholders specify otherwise. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee assists the Board in carrying out its oversight responsibilities for our financial         reporting process, audit process and internal controls. The Company's management is responsible for the financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal         control over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles and         on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee is governed by a charter. A copy of the committee's current charter is available on         the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.lakecitybank.com. As of December 31, 2018, the committee was comprised solely of independent directors. Brian J. Smith has been designated by the Board as an audit committee financial         expert as defined by the SEC.
The Audit Committee reviews with the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting         firm, with and without management present, the effectiveness of our system of internal controls and internal audit procedures; reports of bank regulatory agencies and monitoring of management's compliance with recommendations contained in those         reports; actions by management on recommendations of the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors; and the audited financial statements.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for selecting, appointing and overseeing our independent         registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee performs an annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm and the lead partner concerning the qualifications, performance and independence of the auditors by         considering the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditors, the auditors' capabilities and the auditors' technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's operations and industry. The Audit Committee also participates in         discussions of audit and audit related fees and approves all fees and services of the independent registered public accounting firm. Based on the outcome of the evaluation and discussions, the Audit Committee has appointed Crowe LLP as the         Company's independent registered public accounting firm as of and for the period ending December 31, 2019.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements for the fiscal year         ended December 31, 2018 with our management and Crowe LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. The committee has also discussed with Crowe LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Oversight Board AS16 (Auditing         Standards Communications with Audit Committees) as well as having received and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from Crowe LLP required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, communication with Audit Committees         concerning independence.
Based on the review and discussions with management and Crowe LLP, the Audit Committee has recommended         to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Members of the Audit Committee PROPOSAL NO. 3 – RATIFICATION OF CROWE LLP AS OUR         INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019
Shareholders are also being asked to ratify the appointment of Crowe LLP as our independent registered         public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. If the appointment of Crowe LLP is not ratified by shareholders, the matter of the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm will be considered by the Audit         Committee and Board of Directors. Representatives of Crowe LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, as well as to respond to appropriate questions that may be asked by         shareholders.
Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
[BEGIN TABLE]
      2018       2017    
 Audit Fees     $   415,000       $   409,500    
 Audit-Related Fees       57,970         51,380    
 Tax Fees       109,420         92,900    
 All Other Fees       0         3,081    
 Total     $   582,390       $   556,861    
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. Audit fees consist of the aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed by Crowe LLP for its audit of         Lakeland Financial's annual financial statements for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, for its required reviews of our unaudited interim financial statements included in our Form 10-Qs filed during fiscal 2018 and 2017, for the integrated audit of         internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and for consents and assistance with documents filed with the SEC.
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate audit-related fees billed by Crowe LLP for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 for services which included employee benefit plan audits, captive insurance subsidiary audit and         accounting and financial reporting-related consultations.
Tax Fees. Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees for tax-related services billed by Crowe LLP for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning which included assistance with         the preparation of Lakeland Financial's and subsidiaries' tax returns and guidance with respect to estimated tax payments and for assistance relating to maintaining a real estate investment trust and for assistance related to maintaining a captive         insurance company.
All Other Fees. All other fees consist of the aggregate fees for other services billed by Crowe LLP for fiscal year         2017 for professional services rendered for software license fees. We did not incur any other fees from Crowe LLP for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 other than the fees reported above.
The Audit Committee, after consideration of the matter, does not believe the rendering of these         services by Crowe LLP to be incompatible with maintaining Crowe LLP's independence as our independent registered public accounting firm.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy
Among other things, the Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for and         overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by Crowe LLP and all such services provided in 2017 and 2018 were         pre-approved. These services include audit and audit-related services, tax services, and other services. Crowe LLP and management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by Crowe LLP in         accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis that the Audit Committee had not already specifically approved. The Board of Directors recommends shareholders vote to ratify the appointment of         Crowe LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 by voting "FOR" this proposal. Proxies properly signed and returned will be voted "FOR" this proposal unless shareholders specify otherwise.
