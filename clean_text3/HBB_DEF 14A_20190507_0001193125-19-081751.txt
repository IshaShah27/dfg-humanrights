HAMILTON BEACH BRANDS HOLDING COMPANY 
4421 WATERFRONT DR. 
GLEN ALLEN, VA 23060 
PROXY STATEMENT — MARCH 21, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company," "Hamilton Beach Holding," "we," "our" or "us"), of proxies to be used at the annual meeting of our stockholders to be held on May 7, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the related form of proxy are being mailed to stockholders commencing on or about March 21, 2019. 
If the enclosed form of proxy is executed, dated and returned or if you vote electronically, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as directed on all matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting for a vote. Proxies that are properly signed without any indication of voting instructions will be voted as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Proposal         Description     Board Vote     Recommendation         Page Reference   for More Detail   
N/A    Any other matter properly brought before the Board       As recommended by the Board or, if no  recommendation is given, in the proxy holders' own discretion      N/A 
N/A    Any other matter properly brought before the Board       As recommended by the Board or, if no  recommendation is given, in the proxy holders' own discretion      N/A 
N/A    Any other matter properly brought before the Board       As recommended by the Board or, if no  recommendation is given, in the proxy holders' own discretion      N/A 
[END TABLE]
The proxies may be revoked at any time prior to their exercise by giving notice to us in writing or by executing and delivering a later-dated proxy. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke a proxy, but a stockholder of record attending the Annual Meeting may request a ballot and vote in person, thereby revoking a previously granted proxy. 
Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019 will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. On that date, we had 9,433,164 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Common"), entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and 4,408,715 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Common"), entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of Class A Common is entitled to one vote for a nominee for each of the eleven directorships to be filled and one vote on each other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting. Each share of Class B Common is entitled to ten votes for each such nominee and ten votes on each other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting. Class A Common and Class B Common will vote as a single class on all matters anticipated to be brought before the Annual Meeting. 
At the Annual Meeting, in accordance with Delaware law and our Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"), the inspectors of election appointed by the Board for the Annual Meeting will determine the presence of a quorum and tabulate the results of stockholder voting. As provided by Delaware law and our Bylaws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of all classes of our stock, issued and outstanding, and entitled to vote   at the Annual Meeting and present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, will constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election intend to (1) treat properly executed proxies marked "abstain" as "present" for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the Annual Meeting, and (2) treat proxies held in "street name" by brokers that are voted on at least one, but not all, of the proposals to come before the Annual Meeting (the "broker non-votes") as "present" for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposal 1 is to elect eleven directors, each for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Our Bylaws provide that our directors are elected by a plurality vote. Shares for which authority is withheld to vote for director nominees and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors except to the extent the failure to vote for a director nominee results in another nominee receiving a larger number of votes. In accordance with Delaware law and our Bylaws, the eleven director nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected directors. 
In accordance with our Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve all other proposals that are brought before the Annual Meeting, including Proposal 2. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be treated as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of Proposal 2 or any other proposal properly brought before the Board. Because the ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor is considered a "routine" matter, there will be no broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 2. 
We are not aware of any business that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting other than those matters described in this Proxy Statement. If any matters other than those shown on the proxy card are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the proxy card gives discretionary authority to the persons named on the proxy card to vote the shares represented by such proxy card. 
In accordance with Delaware law and our Bylaws, we may, by a vote of the stockholders, in person or by proxy, adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later date(s), without changing the record date. If we were to determine that an adjournment was desirable, the appointed proxies would use the discretionary authority granted pursuant to the proxy cards to vote in favor of such an adjournment.  PART I – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INFORMATION 
About Hamilton Beach Holding

Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. ("HBB") is a leading designer, marketer, and distributor of branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliances as well as commercial products for restaurants, bars, and hotels.

Separation of Hamilton Beach Holding from NACCO Industries, Inc. 
On September 29, 2017, our Company was spun-off from NACCO Industries, Inc. ("NACCO"), and became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of Hamilton Beach Holding common stock to NACCO stockholders. Our common stock trades under the ticker symbol "HBB" on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). 
Board Composition 
Our Board currently consists of eleven directors. Directors are elected at each annual meeting to serve for one-year terms and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Biographical information and qualifications of our directors are included under "Proposal 1 - Election of Directors" beginning on page 9. 
Directors' Meetings and Committees 
Our Board has the following standing committees: an Audit Review Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ("NCG Committee"), and an Executive Committee. The table below shows the current directors, the members of each committee and the number of meetings held in 2018:

[END TABLE]
Our Board held five meetings in 2018. With the exception of (i) two directors who were not able to attend the Board and committee meetings held in May 2018 and (ii) one director who was not able to attend a committee meeting in March and a Board meeting in August, all of our current directors attended one hundred percent (100%) of the meetings held by our Board and by the committees on which they served in 2018. We hold a regularly scheduled meeting of our Board in conjunction with our annual meeting of stockholders. Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders absent an appropriate excuse. All of our directors who were directors on the date of our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended the annual meeting in person, with the exception of Messrs. Jumper and Ratner.  Our Board has determined that, based primarily on the ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common by the members of the Taplin and Rankin families, we have the characteristics of, and may be, a "controlled company," as defined in Section 303A of the NYSE listing standards. However, the Board has elected not to make use, at the present time, of any of the exceptions to the NYSE listing standards that are available to controlled companies. Accordingly, at least a majority of the members of our Board are independent, as described in the NYSE listing standards, and our Compensation Committee, Audit Review Committee and NCG Committee are composed entirely of independent directors. In making a determination as to the independence of our directors, our Board considered Section 303A of the NYSE listing standards and broadly considered the materiality of each director's relationship with us. Based on this criteria, our Board has determined that the following current directors are independent: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Mark R. Belgya    Michael S. Miller 
 John P. Jumper    James A. Ratner 
 Dennis W. LaBarre    David F. Taplin 
[END TABLE]
David F. Taplin is not standing for re-election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. The Board has nominated Mr. Paul D. Furlow to fill the position that will be left vacant by Mr. Taplin. Mr. Furlow was recommended to the Board as a potential director nominee by a current director of HBB and KC. Based on the independence criteria set forth above, our Board has determined that Paul D. Furlow will be independent if and when elected to serve on the Board. Mr. Furlow's biography is provided on page 10. 
In accordance with NYSE rules, our non-management directors are scheduled to meet in executive session, without management, at least once a year. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee typically presides at such meetings. Additional meetings of the non-management directors may be scheduled when the non-management directors believe such meetings are desirable. The determination of which director should preside at any such additional meetings will be made based on the subject matter to be discussed at each such meeting. Meetings of the non-management directors were held on February 13, 2018 and February 12, 2019. Only independent directors attended those meetings. 
Description of Committees 
Each committee's responsibilities are set forth in the committee's charter which is available on our website at www.hamiltonbeachbrands.com/investors/corporate-governance. 
Audit Review Committee. The Audit Review Committee has responsibilities in its charter with respect to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality and integrity of our financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the adequacy of our internal controls;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our guidelines and policies to monitor and control our major financial risk exposures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the qualifications, independence, selection, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent registered  public accounting firm;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the performance of our internal audit department and independent registered public accounting firm;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assisting our Board and us in interpreting and applying our Corporate Compliance Program and other issues related  to corporate and employee ethics; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all members of the Audit Review Committee are independent and financially literate, as described in the listing  standards of the NYSE and under the rules of the SEC;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Jumper retired as a director of Leidos Holdings, Inc. ("Leidos") and a member of its audit  committee on May 11, 2018. Mr. Jumper's simultaneous service on the audit committees of more than three public companies for periods prior to May 11, 2018 did not impair his ability to effectively serve on the Company's  Audit Review Committee. Effective upon his retirement from Leidos, Mr. Jumper serves on three public company audit committees.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has responsibilities in its charter with respect to the administration of our policies for compensating our employees, including our executive officers and directors. Among other things, these responsibilities include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the review and approval of corporate goals and objectives relevant to executive compensation;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the evaluation of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and other executive officers  in light of these goals and objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the determination and approval of CEO and other executive officer and senior manager compensation levels;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consideration of whether the risks arising from our employee compensation policies are reasonably likely to  have a material adverse effect on us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the selection, compensation, retention and oversight (including the review of the qualification and independence  thereof) of compensation consultants and other advisors to help evaluate director, executive officer and senior manager compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the making of recommendations to our Board, where appropriate or required, and the taking of other actions with  respect to all other compensation matters that are subject to Board approval, including incentive plans and equity-based plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the periodic review of Board compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to the extent required, the preparation of the annual compensation committee report.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, delegate duties and responsibilities to one or more subcommittees or, in appropriate cases, to our senior managers. The Compensation Committee retains and receives assistance in the performance of its responsibilities from an internationally recognized compensation consulting firm, discussed under "Compensation Consultants" on page 19. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is independent, as defined in the SEC rules and the NYSE listing standards. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Among other things, the NCG Committee's responsibilities contained in its charter include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the review and making of recommendations to our Board of the criteria for membership on our Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the review and making of recommendations to our Board of the optimum number and qualifications of directors  believed to be desirable;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the identification and making of recommendations to our Board of specific candidates for membership on our Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and, where appropriate, recommending changes to our Corporate Governance Guidelines;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing evaluations of the Board's effectiveness; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annually reporting to the Board the NCG Committee's assessment of our Board's performance.   
[END TABLE]
 The NCG Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our stockholders. See "Procedures for Submission and Consideration of Director Candidates" on page 38. The Board has determined that each member of the NCG Committee is independent, as defined in the NYSE listing standards. The NCG Committee may consult with members of the Taplin and Rankin families, including Alfred M. Rankin, Jr., regarding the composition of our Board. 
Executive Committee. The Executive Committee may exercise all of the powers of our Board over the management and control of our business during the intervals between meetings of our Board. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Company's roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated, enabling Gregory H. Trepp, our President and CEO, to focus on managing the Company and its separate HBB and KC businesses and Alfred M. Rankin, Jr., our Chairman, to devote his time and attention to matters of strategic oversight, Board oversight and governance. The Board believes that Mr. Rankin possesses in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing the Company and each of our principal businesses. Because of this knowledge and insight, the Board believes that Mr. Rankin is in the best position to effectively identify strategic opportunities and priorities and to lead the discussion for the execution of the Company's strategies and achievement of its objectives. As Chairman, Mr. Rankin is able to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• focus our Board on the most significant strategic goals and risks of our businesses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• utilize the individual qualifications, skills and experience of the other Board members to maximize their  contributions to our Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure that each Board member has sufficient knowledge and understanding of our businesses to enable such other  member to make informed judgments;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• facilitate the flow of information between our Board and our management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide consultation and advice to our management on significant business matters and strategic initiatives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide experience regarding the responsibilities of being a public company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide the perspective of a long-term stockholder.  
[END TABLE]
This Board leadership structure also enhances the effectiveness of the boards of directors of HBB and KC, which have parallel structures to the Company's Board and provide oversight at the strategic and operational level. Each director who serves on our Board is also a member of the HBB and KC boards of directors. Our Chairman also serves as the Chairman of the HBB and KC boards of directors. This structure provides a common and consistent presence that enables the HBB and KC boards of directors to function effectively and efficiently. 
We do not assign a lead independent director, but the Chairman of our Compensation Committee presides at the regularly scheduled meetings of non-management directors. 
Communications with Directors 
Our stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with our Board as a group, with the non-management directors as a group, or with any individual director by sending written communications to Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company, 4421 Waterfront Drive, Glen Allen, Virginia 23060, Attention: Secretary. Complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters will be forwarded directly to the Chairman of the Audit Review Committee. All other communications will be provided to the individual director(s) or group of directors to whom they are addressed. Copies of all communications will be provided to all other directors. However, any communications that are considered improper for submission will not be provided to the directors. Examples of communications that would be considered improper include, without limitation, customer complaints, solicitations, communications that do not relate, directly or indirectly, to our business, or communications that relate to improper or irrelevant topics.  Board Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board oversees our risk management. The full Board (as supplemented by the appropriate Board committee in the case of risks that are overseen by a particular committee) regularly reviews information provided by management in order for our Board to oversee our risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies. Our Board committees assist the full Board's oversight of our material risks by focusing on risks related to the particular area of concentration of the relevant committee. The full Board incorporates the insight provided by these reports into its overall risk management analysis. 
Code of Conduct 
We have adopted a Code of Corporate Conduct that applies to all of our directors and employees and is designed to provide guidance on how to act legally and ethically while performing work for Hamilton Beach Holding. We have also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that provide a framework for the conduct of our Board. The Code of Corporate Conduct, the Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Independence Standards for Directors, as well as the charters of the committees of our Board, are available free of charge on our website at www.hamiltonbeachbrands.com/investors/corporate-governance. 
All of our directors and senior management employees annually complete certifications with respect to their compliance with our Code of Corporate Conduct. 
Review and Approval of Related-Person Transactions 
J.C. Butler, Jr., one of our directors, is the son-in-law of Alfred M. Rankin, Jr., our Chairman. Our directors, Thomas T. Rankin and Roger F. Rankin, are the brothers of Alfred M. Rankin, Jr. As indicated on the Director Compensation Table on page 12, Mr. Butler received $160,048 in total compensation from us as a director and Messrs. Thomas T. Rankin and Roger F. Rankin each received $156,616 in total compensation from us as directors for 2018. 
The Audit Review Committee reviews all relationships and transactions in which we and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest in such transactions. Our legal department is primarily responsible for the processes and controls to obtain information from the directors and executive officers with respect to related person transactions in order to enable the Audit Review Committee to determine whether we or a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. In the course of its review, the Audit Review Committee considers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the material terms of the transaction, including, without limitation, the amount and type of transaction;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the importance of the transaction to the related person and to us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in our best interest;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any other matters the Audit Review Committee deems appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
 Based on this review, the Audit Review Committee will determine whether to approve or ratify any transaction that is directly or indirectly material to us or a related person. 
Any member of the Audit Review Committee who is a related person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or vote with respect to the approval or ratification of the transaction. However, such director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Audit Review Committee that considers the transaction. 
Report of the Audit Review Committee 
The Audit Review Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Review Committee is comprised solely of independent directors as defined by the SEC and described in the listing standards of the NYSE. The Audit Review Committee's responsibilities are listed on page 4 and the Audit Review Committee's charter is available at www.hamiltonbeachbrands.com/investors/corporate-governance. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Review Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report with Company management. 
The Audit Review Committee reviewed with EY, our independent auditor, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of our annual financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Review Committee by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications With Audit Committees, the rules of the SEC, and other applicable regulations. In addition, the Audit Review Committee has discussed with EY the firm's independence from Company management and the Company, including the matters in the letter from EY required by PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with EY's independence.

Furlow. If an unexpected occurrence should make it necessary, in the judgment of the proxy holders, to substitute some other person for any of the nominees, shares represented by proxies will be voted for such other person as the proxy holders may select. 
The disclosure below provides biographical information about each director nominee.

(1)  Amounts in this column reflect the annual retainers and other fees earned by the directors in 2018. They also  include payment for fractional shares of Class A Common that were paid under the Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Non-Employee Directors' Equity Compensation Plan, referred to as the "Non-Employee Directors Plan," described below. During 2018, Mr. Ratner elected to receive additional shares of Class A Common under the Non-Employee  Directors Plan in lieu of cash for a portion of his retainer equal to $93,000. The grant date fair value of such additional shares is included in the "Stock Awards" column.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Under the Non-Employee Directors Plan, the directors are required to  receive a portion of their annual retainer in shares of Class A Common (the "Mandatory Shares"). They are also permitted to elect to receive all or part of the remainder of the retainer in the form of shares of Class A Common  (the "Voluntary Shares"). Amounts in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of the Mandatory Shares and Voluntary Shares that were granted to directors under the Non-Employee  Directors Plan, determined pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, referred to as "FASB ASC Topic 718." See Note (12) to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information regarding the accounting treatment of our equity awards. All Mandatory Shares and Voluntary Shares are immediately  vested when granted. Therefore, no equity awards remained outstanding at the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The amount listed includes: (i) Company-paid life insurance premiums in the amount of $448 for the  directors; (ii) other Company-paid premiums for accidental death and dismemberment insurance for the director and his spouse; and (iii) with the exception of Messrs. Butler, Jumper and Miller (who continue to be covered by a policy offered  by NACCO), personal excess liability insurance premiums for the directors and immediate family members. The amount listed also includes charitable contributions made in our name on behalf of the director and his spouse under our matching charitable  gift program in the amount of $5,000 for each director other than Mr. Ratner.

 Additional Information Relating to the Director Compensation Table 
Each non-employee director was entitled to receive the following compensation for their service in 2018 on our Board and on our subsidiaries' boards of directors: 
The retainers are paid quarterly in arrears. No meeting fees are paid, but each director is also reimbursed for expenses incurred as a result of attendance at meetings. 
Under the Non-Employee Directors Plan, each non-employee director receives $90,000 of his $150,000 retainer in the form of restricted shares of Class A Common. Any fractional shares are paid in cash. The number of shares of Class A Common issued to a director is determined by the following formula: 
the dollar value of the portion of the $90,000 retainer that was earned by the director each quarter divided by the average closing price of shares of Class A Common on the NYSE for each week during such quarter. 
These shares are fully vested on the date of grant, and the director is entitled to all rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote and receive dividends. However, the directors are generally required to hold the shares for a period of up to ten years from the last day of the calendar quarter for which the shares were earned and, during that ten-year holding period, the shares cannot be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, hypothecated or encumbered except by will or by laws of descent and distribution, in the event of divorce pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order or to a trust or partnership for the benefit of the director or his spouse, children or grandchildren. The transfer restrictions lapse earlier in the event of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• death, permanent disability or five years from the date the director is no longer a member of the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the date that a director is both no longer a member of our Board and has reached age 70; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at such other time as determined by the Board in its sole discretion.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, each director may elect to receive shares of Class A Common in lieu of cash for up to 100% of the balance of his retainers. However, these Voluntary Shares are not subject to the foregoing transfer restrictions. Under the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Plan, no director may receive more than 30,000 shares of Class A Common in any calendar year under the plan. 
Each director also receives (i) $50,000 in Company-paid life insurance; (ii) Company-paid accidental death and dismemberment insurance for the director and spouse; (iii) $10 million in personal excess liability insurance and $3 million in uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance for specified directors and immediate family members who reside with the director, and (iv) up to $5,000 per year in matching charitable contributions. 
Director Compensation Program for 2019 
The Compensation Committee periodically evaluates and recommends changes to our compensation program for directors. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged the Korn Ferry Hay Group, referred to as the "Hay Group," to evaluate and provide recommendations regarding our director compensation program. Our Board of Directors adopted certain recommendations and made changes effective January 1, 2019.  The revised director compensation program is structured in a similar manner to the 2018 program. However, the annual retainer paid to each non-employee director for service on our Board of Directors was increased from $150,000 ($90,000 of which is required to be paid in restricted shares of Class A Common) to $155,000 ($95,000 of which will be paid in restricted shares of Class A Common). In addition, in conjunction with the retirement of Mr. Rankin from his position as Executive Chairman of the Company on December 31, 2018 and his appointment as non-executive Chairman of the Board, a non-employee director role, effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Rankin will receive an annual retainer of $250,000 ($150,000 of which is required to be paid in restricted shares of Class A Common). Refer to page 30 for a detailed description of other changes to Mr. Rankin's compensation for 2019.  PROPOSAL 2 - RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE 
COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
Ernst & Young LLP has been selected by the Audit Review Committee as the principal independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year for us and our subsidiaries. The Audit Review Committee considered carefully EY's performance and its independence with respect to the services to be performed. The Audit Review Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the retention of EY. In connection with the mandated rotation of the lead audit partner, the Audit Review Committee and its Chairman will continue to be directly involved in the selection of EY's lead audit partner. The Audit Review Committee annually evaluates the performance of EY and determines whether to reengage the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted to a vote of our stockholders for ratification. However, our Board believes that obtaining stockholder ratification is a sound governance practice.

[END TABLE]
It is expected that representatives of EY will attend the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and, if a representative is in attendance, the representative will be available to answer appropriate questions. 
If our stockholders fail to vote in favor of the appointment of EY, the Audit Review Committee will take such actions as it deems necessary as a result of such stockholder vote. Even if the appointment of EY is ratified, the Audit Review Committee may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during fiscal year 2019 if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Review Committee has determined that the provision of non-audit services to us by EY may be generally incompatible with maintaining its independence. As a result, we have adopted policies limiting the services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm that are not audit or audit-related services. 
Under our pre-approval policies and procedures, only audit, audit-related services and limited tax services will be performed by EY. All such services must be pre-approved by our Audit Review Committee. For 2018, the Audit Review Committee authorized us to engage EY for specific audit, audit-related and tax services up to specified fee levels. The Audit Review Committee has delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Review Committee together with one other Audit Review Committee member the authority to approve services other than audit, review or attest services, which approvals are reported to the Audit Review Committee at its next meeting. We provide a summary of authorities and commitments at each general meeting of the Audit Review Committee. 
Fee Information 
Fees for professional services provided by our auditors in 2017 and 2018 are included the table below (in thousands):

Discussion of the Executive Compensation Program 
Executive Compensation Governance 
The Hamilton Beach Holding compensation committee establishes and oversees the administration of the policies, programs and procedures for compensating our NEOs. The members of the HBB compensation committee and the Hamilton Beach Holding compensation committee, referred to collectively as the "Compensation Committee" unless the context requires otherwise, consist solely of independent directors. The Hamilton Beach Holding Compensation Committee's responsibilities are listed on page 5. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of our executive officers serves or have served on the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our Compensation Committee. 
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions 
Our management, in particular the CEO of Hamilton Beach Holding, reviews Company goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive officers. Mr. Trepp annually reviews the performance of each executive officer and makes recommendations based on these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and incentive compensation award amounts, to the Compensation Committee, except that Mr. Trepp's and Mr. Rankin's performance is reviewed by the Hamilton Beach Holding Compensation Committee. In addition to the CEO recommendations, the Compensation Committee considers recommendations made by the Hay Group which bases its recommendations upon an analysis of similar positions at a broad range of domestic industries, as well as an understanding of our policies and objectives, as described below. The Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to executive officers. After considering these recommendations, the Compensation Committee determines the base salary and incentive compensation levels for the executive officers, including each NEO, and any additional discretionary payments. 
Compensation Consultants 
The Compensation Committee receives assistance and advice from the Hay Group. The Hay Group is engaged by and reports to the Compensation Committee and also provides advice and discusses compensation issues directly with management.  Throughout 2018, the Hay Group made recommendations regarding substantially all aspects of compensation for the directors and senior management employees, including the NEOs. For 2018, the Hay Group was engaged in general to make recommendations regarding: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• director compensation levels;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 salary midpoints, incentive compensation targets (calculated as a percentage of salary midpoint) and target  total compensation for senior management positions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 salary midpoints and/or range movement for all other employee positions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ad-hoc position evaluations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• mid-year Hay point levels, salary midpoints and incentive targets for all  new senior management positions and/or changes to current senior management positions.  
[END TABLE]
All Hay point recommendations are determined by the Hay Group through the consistent application of the Hay point methodology, which is a proprietary method that takes into account the know-how, problem solving and accountability requirements of the position. 
Representatives of the Hay Group attended one Compensation Committee meeting in 2018 and, during that meeting, consulted with the Compensation Committee in executive session without management present. The Hay Group did not provide any other services to us or the Compensation Committee in 2018. The Compensation Committee considered and assessed the independence of the Hay Group and all relevant factors including the six factors set forth in Rule 10c-1(b) (4)(i)-(vi) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, referred to as the "Exchange Act," that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to the Hay Group. Based on this review, we are not aware of any conflict of interest that has been raised by the work performed by the Hay Group. 
Hay Group's General Industrial Survey — Salary Midpoint 
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the NACCO compensation committee utilized a proprietary survey known as the Hay Group "All Industrial survey" for purposes of setting target total compensation for the senior management employees of the NACCO-wide group, including those of the Company. The All Industrial survey contained data from a broad group of domestic industrial organizations ranging in size from approximately $150 million to $5 billion in annual revenues. As a starting point for setting target total compensation for 2018, our Compensation Committee directed the Hay Group to use a similar survey known as the "General Industrial survey," which also contains data from a broad group of domestic industrial organizations, but ranging in size from approximately $500 million to $1 billion in annual revenues, to more accurately reflect the size of our Company following the Spin-Off. The make-up of the reporting companies and operating units in the General Industrial and All Industrial surveys are very similar except that the Compensation Committee directed the Hay Group to exclude retail and finance segments from the data results. For 2018, participants in the General Industrial survey included 475 parent organizations and 1,108 independent operating units that satisfied the Hay Group's quality assurance controls. 
The Compensation Committee chose the modified General Industrial survey as its benchmark because it provides relevant information regarding the compensation paid to employees, including senior management employees, with similar skill sets used in our industry and represents the talent pool from which we recruit. In addition, the use of a broad-based survey reduces the volatility and lessens the impact of cyclical upswings or downturns in any one industry that could otherwise skew the survey results in any particular year. 
Using its proprietary Hay point methodology, the Hay Group compares positions of similar scope and complexity with the data contained in the General Industrial survey. The Compensation Committee directed the Hay Group to derive a median salary level for each Hay point level targeted at the 50th percentile of the General Industrial survey (the "salary midpoint"). The Compensation Committee set target compensation levels for senior management employees of the Company and HBB, including the NEOs, at the salary midpoint determined by the Hay Group.  Because salary midpoints are based on each Hay point level, all of the employees at a particular Hay point level at a particular company generally have the same salary midpoint. The salary midpoint provided by the Hay Group is then used to calculate the target total compensation of all senior management employees, including the NEOs. 
Compensation Policy and Methodology — Target Total Compensation 
The Compensation Committee establishes a comprehensively defined "target total compensation" amount for each senior management employee following rigorous evaluation standards that help to ensure internal equity. In this process, the Compensation Committee reviews "tally sheets" for the NEOs and other senior management employees that list each employee's title, Hay points and the following information for the current year, as well as that being proposed for the subsequent year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary midpoint, as determined by the Hay Group from the General Industrial survey;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash in lieu of perquisites (if applicable);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term incentive target dollar amount (determined by multiplying the salary midpoint by a specified  percentage of that midpoint, as determined by the Compensation Committee, with advice from the Hay Group, for each salary grade);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive target dollar amount (determined in the same manner as the short-term incentive target);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target total compensation, which is the sum of the foregoing amounts; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary.  
[END TABLE]
In November 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the tally sheets for each of our NEOs to decide whether it should make changes to the 2018 compensation program. The Compensation Committee determined that the overall program continued to be consistent with its compensation objectives and did not make any material changes for 2018 other than (i) transferring Messrs. Trepp and Tidey and all other senior executives in the U.S. from the Long-Term Cash Plan to the Long-Term Equity Plan and (ii) increasing Mr. Trepp's short-term and long-term incentive target opportunity levels to remain in a market competitive range. Mr. Trepp's short-term incentive target was increased from 70% to 90% and his long-term incentive target was increased from 150% to 170%. 
The Compensation Committee views the various components of compensation as related but distinct. While the Compensation Committee determines the salary midpoint based on the information provided from the General Industrial survey, it generally sets base salary levels between 80% and 120% of salary midpoint. The Compensation Committee also obtains the total target incentive compensation amounts from the General Industrial survey but determines the mix of short-term and long-term incentives in its discretion, based on its decision regarding how best to motivate employees. 
The following table sets forth target total compensation for the NEOs, as recommended by the Hay Group and approved by the Compensation Committee for 2018:

(1)  In addition to providing limited perquisites to a limited number of employees in unique circumstances, senior  management employees are paid a fixed dollar amount of cash in lieu of perquisites. The dollar amounts provided to the NEOs in 2018 were based on an analysis performed by the Hay Group in 2014 and re-approved  by the NACCO compensation committee in 2017. Based on this analysis, our Compensation

[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts shown include a 15% increase from the Hay-recommended  long-term target award that the Compensation Committee applies each year to account for the immediately taxable nature of the Long-Term Equity Plan awards.  
[END TABLE]
Target total compensation is supplemented by health and welfare benefits and retirement benefits, which consist of both (i) a qualified defined contribution plan and (ii) the Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. Excess Retirement Plan (the "HBB Excess Plan"), a non-qualified defined contribution plan. Certain NEOs and other employees are also entitled to frozen pension benefits under the Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. Pension Plan (the "HBB Pension Plan"). However, while Mr. Rankin participated in health and welfare benefits and retirement benefit plans of NACCO prior to the Spin-Off, he received more limited health and welfare benefits, and no retirement benefits, from Hamilton Beach Holding from the Spin-Off through December 31, 2018. In addition, the Compensation Committee may award discretionary cash and equity bonuses to employees, including the NEOs, although it rarely does so and did not do so for the NEOs in 2018. 
Base Salary 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the base salary for the NEOs by taking into account their individual performance for 2017 and the relationship of their 2017 base salary to the new 2018 salary midpoint for their Hay point level. In general, base salaries are set between 80% and 120% of an employee's salary midpoint. 
The following table sets forth the salary midpoint, base salary and cash paid in lieu of perquisites determined for each NEO for 2018:

Incentive Compensation 
Overview. The Compensation Committee believes that a material percentage of the NEOs' compensation should be contingent on the performance of Hamilton Beach Holding and/or the business unit for which they are responsible. However, for 2018, the incentive compensation of each of the NEOs was based solely on the performance of HBB. The Compensation Committee did not take the performance of KC into account when determining the incentive compensation benefits for any of our NEOs for 2018. In 2018, Messrs. Trepp and Tidey participated in the Short-Term Plan and the Long-Term Equity Plan (collectively, with the Long-Term Cash Plan, the "Incentive Plans"), while Mr. Rankin only participated in the Long-Term Equity Plan. 
The performance criteria and target performance levels for the Incentive Plans are established within the Compensation Committee's discretion, and are generally based on management's recommendations as to the performance objectives of the Company or the particular business unit for the year. Three types of performance targets are used in the Incentive Plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Targets Based on Annual Operating Plans. Certain performance targets are based on forecasts contained in  the 2018 annual operating plan ("AOP"). With respect to these targets, there is an expectation that these performance targets will be met during the year. If they are not, the participants will not receive all or a portion of the award  that is based on these performance criteria. In 2018, the Compensation Committee set the financial performance targets under the Short-Term Plan against the 2018 AOP so that employees would receive an incentive payout if they achieved AOP results in  the  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     short-term. However, the entry level and maximum payment limits under the Short-Term Plan were set so that employees would not be over-compensated simply for meeting AOP results.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Targets Based on Long-Term Goals. Other performance targets are not based on the 2018 AOP. Rather, they  are based on long-term goals established by the Compensation Committee. Because these targets are not based on the AOP, it is possible in any given year that the level of actual performance may be above or below the specified performance target for  that year. Certain performance targets under the Long-Term Cash Plan and the Long-Term Equity Plan are examples of targets that are based on long-term corporate objectives. These targets represent performance that the Compensation Committee believes  the Company should deliver over the long-term, not the performance that is expected in the current year or the near term.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating Profit Margin Over-Ride. The Compensation Committee approved an adjusted operating profit margin  "over-ride" feature for each Incentive Plan for 2018. This feature provides for a reduction in the payouts otherwise determined under the pre-established performance targets under the Incentive Plans  unless a separate adjusted operating profit margin target is achieved.  
[END TABLE]
Incentive Compensation Tables. When reviewing the incentive compensation tables beginning on page 24, the following factors should be considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For 2018, the maximum awards under the Short-Term Plan may not exceed 150% of the target award level (or  $2,500,000 per participant per year). The cash-denominated awards under the Long-Term Equity Plan may not exceed 150% of the target award level (or the greater of $12,000,000 and the fair market value of 500,000 shares of Class A Common,  determined at the time of payment, per participant per year). None of the NEOs participated in the Long-Term Cash Plan for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The maximum award achievement percentages are based on the formulas contained in underlying performance  guidelines adopted annually by the Compensation Committee for each Incentive Plan. The formulas do not provide for straight-line interpolation from the performance target to the maximum payment target.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target awards for each executive are equal to a specified percentage of the executive's 2018 salary  midpoint, based on the number of Hay points assigned to the position and the appropriate level of incentive compensation targets recommended by the Hay Group and adopted by the Compensation Committee at that level. The Compensation Committee then  increases the target awards under the Long-Term Equity Plan by 15% to account for the immediately taxable nature of the award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Incentive Plans each have a one-year performance period.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Final awards are determined after year-end by comparing actual  performance to the pre-established performance targets that were set by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may decrease or eliminate awards. The Compensation Committee, in  its discretion, may also increase awards and may approve the payment of awards where performance would otherwise not meet the minimum criteria set for payment of awards, although it rarely does so.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-Term Plan awards are paid annually in cash. Long-Term Equity Plan awards are paid annually in a combination  of cash and restricted shares of Class A Common. Restricted shares issued to our NEOs under the Long-Term Equity Plan are subject to a ten-year holding period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All NEO incentive awards are fully vested when granted.  
[END TABLE]
Short-Term Incentive Compensation 
Depending on the NEO's position, the Short-Term Plan was designed to provide target short-term incentive compensation of between 50% and 90% of each participant's 2018 salary midpoint. The following table shows the short-term target awards and payouts approved by the Compensation Committee for each NEO for 2018:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  HBB's Return on Total Capital Employed (ROTCE) is defined as (i) Earnings Before Interest After-Tax after adjustments divided by (ii) Total Capital Employed after adjustments. Earnings Before Interest After-Tax is equal to the sum of interest expense, net of  interest income, less 25% for taxes, plus consolidated net income from continuing operations. Total Capital Employed is equal to (i) the sum of the average debt and average stockholders' equity less (ii) average consolidated cash.  Average debt, stockholders' equity and consolidated cash are calculated by taking the sum of the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of each of the next twelve months divided by thirteen. ROTCE is calculated using  average debt, average stockholders' equity and average cash based on the sum of the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of each quarter divided by five, which is then adjusted for any  non-recurring or special items. Following (dollar amounts in thousands) is the calculation of HBB's adjusted 2018 consolidated ROTCE for purposes of determining payouts under the Short-Term Plan for 2018:   
[END TABLE]

 HBB Adjusted Consolidated ROTCE      25.97%   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Adjustments to the ROTCE calculation are for non-recurring or special  items that were established by the Compensation Committee at the time the ROTCE targets were set, including eliminating from all amounts used in the calculation the after-tax expenses relating to any  acquisition or disposition, whether in progress or successful. For 2018, additional adjustments related to (i) the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation; and (ii) the after-tax  impact of the following costs or expenses, were made only if they were in excess of the amounts included in the 2018 AOP:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any tangible or intangible asset impairment;  
• restructuring costs including reduction in force and inventory liquidation charges;  
• certain patent infringement and other litigation and settlement costs;  
• environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, product recall and early lease termination expenses;   
• refinancing and similar charges, costs relating to repatriating foreign earnings and pension settlement charges;   
• costs relating to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets; and  
• costs relating to changes in laws and regulations.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that these items were incurred in connection with improving our operations and, as a result, these items should not adversely affect incentive payments, as the actions or events were beneficial or were generally not within the employees' control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  In calculating the final performance results, adjustments were made for various items incurred in connection  with improving operations, consistent with the adjustments listed for the ROTCE calculation in Note (1) above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  An additional performance target continued to apply to the Short-Term Plan for 2018. Unless HBB's Adjusted  Operating Profit Margin exceeded 4% for the year, the final payout percentage under the plan would be reduced by up to 40% from the amount otherwise determined under the formula shown above. This target acts as an additional control which reflects  the Compensation Committee's view that full incentive compensation payments should not be paid if HBB does not meet a minimum Operating Profit Margin threshold for the year. Because HBB's Adjusted Operating Profit Margin exceeded 4% in  2018, no reduction occurred.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
In General. The purpose of our long-term incentive compensation plans is to enable senior management employees to accumulate capital through managerial performance, which the Compensation Committee believes contributes to the future success of our business. Our long-term incentive plans require long-term commitment on the part of our senior management employees, and cash withdrawals or stock sales are generally not permitted for a number of years. Rather, the awarded amount is effectively invested in the Company for an extended period which strengthens the tie between stockholders' and the NEOs' long-term interests. 
Those individual NEOs who have a greater impact on our long-term strategy receive a higher percentage of their compensation as long-term compensation. In general, the Compensation Committee does not consider an NEO's long-term incentive award for prior periods when determining the value of a long-term incentive award for the current period because it considers those prior awards to represent compensation for past services. In 2018, all senior executives in the U.S., including all of the NEOs, participated in our Long-Term Equity Plan. All non-U.S. senior management employees continued to participate in the Long-Term Cash Plan. Messrs. Trepp and Tidey continue to maintain outstanding awards under the Long-Term Cash Plan that will be paid in future years. 
Depending on the NEO's position, the long-term plans were designed to provide target long-term incentive compensation of between 70% and 170% of the NEO's 2018 salary midpoint (increased by 15% for participants in the Long-Term Equity Plan as described below). The table below shows the long-term target awards and payouts approved by the Compensation Committee for each NEO for 2018:

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The target percentages under the Long-Term Equity Plan include a 15% increase from the Hay-recommended long-term target award that the Compensation Committee applies each year to account for the immediately taxable nature of the Long-Term Equity Plan awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Refer to the table below for detailed calculations of the 2018 payout percentage for the Long-Term Equity Plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  Awards under the Long-Term Equity Plan are initially denominated in dollars. The amounts shown in columns  (C) and (E) reflect the dollar-denominated target and actual awards. This is the amount that is used by the Compensation Committee when analyzing the total compensation of the NEOs. The dollar-denominated awards are then paid to the  participants in a combination of cash (approximately 35%) and restricted shares (approximately 65%). The number of shares issued to a participant for an award is determined by taking the dollar amount of the stock component of the award and dividing  it by the formula share price. The formula share price is generally calculated as the lower of the average share price during the 2018 performance year or the preceding calendar year (2017). For 2018 awards, however, a modified calculation is  required to determine the formula share price as a result of the Spin-Off and the fact that our Class A Common shares did not begin trading until September 30, 2017. The Compensation Committee  defined the formula share price for the 2018 awards as the lower of (i) the average of our Class A Common share price for 2018, which was $24.392, or (ii) $24.66, which was determined by taking our allocable portion of the value for the  average share price of a hypothetical "Hamilton Beach Holding/NACCO composite" share for 2017. The amount shown in column (F) is the sum of (i) the cash distributed and (ii) the grant date fair value of the stock that was  distributed for the 2018 long-term award. This amount is computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See Note (12) to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form  10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information regarding the accounting treatment of our equity awards. This is the same amount that is disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table on page  17. The shares were valued on the date on which the award was approved by the Compensation Committee. The difference in the amounts disclosed in columns (E) and (F) is due to the fact that the value shown in Column (E) was calculated using  the formula share price of $24.392 (explained above), while the grant date fair value in Column (F) was calculated using $24.965, which is the average of the high and low share price on the date the shares were granted. As required under the  Long-Term Equity Plan, at the time the stock award was issued, the NEOs each surrendered a portion of their shares to pay for additional tax withholding obligations associated with the award.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Equity Plan. 
Target awards under the Long-Term Equity Plan are initially expressed in a dollar amount equal to a percentage of the participant's salary midpoint based on the number of Hay points assigned to the executive's position and the long-term incentive compensation targets for that Hay point level recommended by the Hay Group and adopted by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee then increases these amounts by 15% to account for the immediately taxable nature of the equity awards. 
Approximately 65% of the awards are distributed in shares of restricted stock and the remaining 35% is distributed in cash to approximate initially the income tax withholding obligation for the stock. The actual number of shares of stock issued is determined by taking the dollar value of the stock component of the award and dividing it by a formula share price. For this purpose, the formula share price is calculated as the lesser of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The average closing price of a share of our Class A Common on the NYSE at the end of each week during the  calendar year preceding the performance year (or such other previous calendar year as determined by the Compensation Committee no later than the 90th day of the performance period); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The average closing price of a share of our Class A Common on the NYSE at the end of each week during the  performance period.  
[END TABLE]
However, for 2018 awards, a modified formula share price was established as a result of the impact of the Spin-Off. See Note (3) to the Long-Term Incentive Compensation table on page 25.  Award shares under the Long-Term Equity Plan are fully vested when granted, and the participants have all of the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote and receive dividends upon receipt of the shares. The full amount of the award, including the fair market value of the restricted shares on the date of grant, is fully taxable to the participant. Award shares issued under the Long-Term Equity Plan have a holding period of three, five or ten years, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The ten-year holding period applies to award shares issued to our NEOs. The transfer restrictions lapse earlier in the event of (i) the participant's death or permanent disability; or (ii) a period of three years from the date of retirement (or earlier with the approval of the Compensation Committee). The Compensation Committee has the right to release the restrictions at an earlier date, but rarely does so except in the case of the release of a limited number of shares for the payment of educational and medical expenses or home purchases, as permitted under the terms of the plan. No early release requests were made by or granted to the NEOs in 2018. 
Any gain participants realize in the long-run from awards issued under the Long-Term Equity Plan depends on what management does to drive the financial performance of the Company and increase the stock price. This is because the restricted shares awarded under the plan generally may not be transferred for a period of up to ten years, as determined by the Compensation Committee, following the last day of the award year. During the holding period, the ultimate value of the shares is subject to change based on the value of the shares of Class A Common. The value of the award is enhanced as the value of the stock increases or is reduced as the value of the stock decreases. Thus, the awards provide the executives with an incentive over the holding period to increase the value of the Company, which is expected to lead to long-term return to stockholders. The Compensation Committee believes that this encourages our executives to maintain a long-term focus on our profitability, which is also in the Company's best interests. 
As a result of the annual equity grants under the Long-Term Equity Plan and the corresponding transfer restrictions, the number of shares of Class A Common that an executive holds generally increases each year. Consequently, these executives will continue to have or accumulate exposure to long-term performance notwithstanding any short-term changes in the price of shares of Class A Common. This increased exposure strongly aligns the long-term interests of the NEOs with those of other stockholders. 
The following table shows the performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee to determine final incentive compensation payments for 2018 under the Long-Term Equity Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Criteria     (A) Weighting   Performance Target      Performance Result       (B) Achievement Percentage    (A) x (B) Payout Percentage 
Performance Criteria     (A) Weighting   Performance Target      Performance Result       (B) Achievement Percentage    (A) x (B) Payout Percentage 
   HBB Adjusted Net Sales (1)    50%     —        —      105.3%   52.7% 
   HBB Adjusted Operating Profit Margin (1)    50%     —        —      87.5%   43.8% 
   Final Payout Percentage                      96.5% (2) 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The Compensation Committee only uses two financial metrics under the Long-Term Equity Plan – net sales and  operating profit margin. The use of these metrics reflects our focus on increasing profitability at HBB over the long-term. We do not disclose the HBB net sales or operating profit margin targets or results because they would reveal competitively  sensitive long-term financial information, as well as our long-range business plans, to our competitors. The Compensation Committee believed HBB could meet both the 2018 sales target and operating profit margin target. In calculating the final  performance results, adjustments were made for various items incurred in connection with improving operations, consistent with the adjustments listed in Note (1) to the Short-Term Plan table on page 24.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  The additional Adjusted Operating Profit Margin performance target described in Note (3) to the Short-Term  Plan table on page 24 also applied to the Long-Term Equity Plan in 2018. As stated therein, because HBB's Adjusted Operating Profit Margin exceeded the 4% threshold, Long-Term Equity Plan payouts were not reduced for 2018.   
[END TABLE]
Discretionary Restricted Stock Awards. Hamilton Beach Holding also maintains the Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Supplemental Executive Long-Term Incentive Bonus Plan, which gives the Compensation Committee the flexibility to provide additional discretionary equity compensation. The Compensation Committee did not grant any awards under this plan for services performed in 2018.  Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End 
Each NEO participated in the Long-Term Equity Plan in 2018. Awards are based on one-year performance periods and are immediately vested and paid when approved by the Compensation Committee. Therefore, no equity awards remained outstanding at year-end for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Other Compensation of Named Executive Officers 
Discretionary Cash Bonuses. The Compensation Committee has the authority to grant, and has from time to time granted, discretionary cash bonuses to employees, including the NEOs, in addition to the incentive compensation described above. The Compensation Committee uses discretionary cash bonuses to reward substantial achievement or superior service, particularly when such achievement or service is not reflected in the performance criteria established under the incentive plans. No discretionary cash bonuses were awarded to the NEOs for 2018 performance. 
Retirement Plans. The material terms of the various retirement plans are described below. 
We no longer provide any defined benefit pensions to any employees, including the NEOs. Prior to 1997, Mr. Tidey earned a cash balance pension benefit under the HBB Pension Plan. Benefits under the HBB Pension Plan are now frozen, except that frozen cash balance accounts continue to earn interest. Mr. Tidey is 100% vested in his pension benefits and may take a distribution of his cash balance benefits at any time following his termination of employment. Messrs. Rankin and Trepp never participated in any of our frozen pension plans. 
Mr. Rankin received defined contribution retirement benefits from NACCO prior to the Spin-Off, but he does not participate in any of our retirement plans. We provide our other full-time employees (including Messrs. Trepp and Tidey) with defined contribution retirement benefits. The benefits that are provided to the NEOs and other executive officers of the Company are provided under a combination of a qualified retirement plan and the HBB Excess Plan, while the benefits that are provided to other employees are provided only under the qualified plan. The HBB Excess Plan provides retirement benefits that would have been provided under the qualified plan, but that cannot be provided due to federal tax law limits and non-discrimination requirements. 
Our active retirement plans provide the following three types of benefits: (i) employee deferrals of up to 25% of compensation; (ii) "safe harbor" employer contributions equal to 3% of compensation; and (iii) profit sharing benefits. The compensation that is taken into account under our plans generally includes base salary, overtime and other similar items of compensation required to be reported on a Form W-2 but excludes most other forms of compensation including long-term incentive compensation and other bonus or discretionary payments. However, short-term incentive payments and other annual bonuses are included solely for purposes of calculating profit sharing benefits. 
The profit sharing formula is based on a specified percentage of compensation that also takes into account the employee's age and Company performance for the year. If the Company performs well, the amount of the profit sharing contribution increases. As applied to the NEOs in 2018, the range of profit sharing contributions were (1) between 5.30% and 10.85% (for Mr. Trepp) and between 4.40% and 9.00% (for Mr. Tidey) of all eligible compensation and (2) 5.7% of eligible compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base for the year. 
The NEOs are each 100% vested in their retirement benefits. Benefits under the qualified plan are payable at any time following a termination of employment. Participants have the right to invest their qualified plan account balances among various investment options that are offered by the plan's trustee. Participants can elect various forms of payment including lump sum distributions and installments. 
Under the HBB Excess Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• participants' account balances, other than excess profit sharing benefits, are credited with interest during  the year based on the rate of return of the Vanguard RST fixed income fund, which is one of the investment funds under the qualified plan (14% maximum); however, no interest is credited on excess profit sharing benefits;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the amounts credited under the HBB Excess Plan each year are paid prior to March 15th of the following year to  avoid regulatory complexities and eliminate the risk of non-payment to the executives based on the unfunded nature of the HBB Excess Plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the amounts credited under the HBB Excess Plan are increased by 15% to reflect the immediately taxable nature of  the payments.  
[END TABLE]
Other Benefits. All salaried U.S. employees, including the NEOs (other than Mr. Rankin, who received limited welfare benefits from us after the Spin-Off and through 2018), generally participate in a variety of health and welfare benefit plans that are designed to enable us to attract and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits. Although we provide limited perquisites and other personal benefits to certain executives, we do not believe these perquisites and other personal benefits constitute a material component of the executive officer's compensation package. The modest amount of cash paid to the NEOs in lieu of perquisites in 2018 is separately disclosed in the table on page 21 and the limited non-cash perquisites are disclosed in Note (5) to the Summary Compensation Table on page 18. 
No Individual Employment or Severance Agreements. During 2018, none of the NEOs had an employment agreement that provides for a fixed period of employment, fixed positions or duties, or for a fixed base salary or actual or target incentive bonus. 
Upon an NEO's termination of employment for any reason, the NEOs (and all other employees) are entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amounts earned during their term of employment, including earned but unpaid salary and accrued but unused  vacation pay; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• benefits that are provided under the retirement plans, Incentive Plans and HBB Excess Plan that are further  described in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
There are no individual severance contracts with any of the NEOs. Upon termination of employment in certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of the plans, the NEOs are only entitled to severance pay and continuation of certain health benefits provided under broad-based severance pay plans that are generally available to all salaried employees that provide benefits for a stated period of time based on length of service, with various maximum time periods. The Compensation Committee will consider the facts and circumstances of a NEO's separation to determine whether any material severance payment that is in excess of the amount the NEO is otherwise entitled to receive under the broad-based severance plans is appropriate. 
Limited Change in Control Benefits for All Employees. In order to advance the compensation objective of attracting, retaining and motivating qualified management, the Compensation Committee believes that it is appropriate to provide limited change in control protections to the NEOs and other employees. NEOs have the same protections as other senior management employees. In the event of a change in control, employees are provided: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of vested awards for prior years under the Long-Term Cash Plan that have been earned but not yet  paid; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of a pro-rata target award under the current year's  Incentive Plans.  
[END TABLE]
Importantly, these change in control provisions are not employment agreements and do not guarantee employment for any of the executives for any period of time. In addition, none of the change in control payments will be "grossed up" for any excise taxes imposed on the executives as a result of the receipt of payments upon a change in control.  Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") generally provides that a publicly traded company may not deduct compensation of more than $1 million per person that is paid in the year to a company's chief executive officer or current or former other named executive officers. However, in the case of tax years commencing before 2018, the statute exempted qualifying "performance-based" compensation from the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Section 162(m) was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, to expand the group of current and former executive officers who may be covered by the 162(m) deduction limit and to eliminate the exemption for performance-based compensation, other than with respect to payments made pursuant to certain "grandfathered" arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017. 
As part of its role, the Compensation Committee continues to consider in very general terms the deductibility of the compensation it awards. However, it did not consider in any substantial way any specific quantification of potential deductibility or potential lost deductibility when making its 2018 compensation decisions. Therefore, the Committee maintains the flexibility to compensate executive officers based on an overall determination of what it believes is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, even if all or a portion of the compensation is determined not be deductible under applicable law. The Compensation Committee believes that the tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise our ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract and retain the executive talent to compete successfully. 
Executive Compensation Program for 2019 
Our executive compensation program for 2019 will be structured in a manner similar to our 2018 program. Principle changes for 2019 include (1) modifications to salary midpoints and base salaries in view of internal considerations as well as marketplace practice as reflected in analyses, general survey data relating to salary trends and the recommendations of the Hay Group based on an updated General Industrial survey and (2) changes to certain performance measures, weightings and/or targets for the Incentive Plans based on management recommendations as to the performance objectives of our business for 2019. 
We previously announced that Mr. Rankin retired from his position as the Executive Chairman of the Company effective December 31, 2018 and became the non-executive Chairman of the Board effective January 1, 2019. In that director role, he will receive an annual retainer of $250,000 ($150,000 of which will be paid in restricted shares of Class A Common). In order to facilitate a smooth transition after Mr. Rankin's retirement from the Company, the Company and Mr. Rankin also entered into a consulting agreement independent of his continuing role as the non-executive Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the consulting agreement, Mr. Rankin will support the President and CEO of the Company, commencing January 1, 2019. In this consulting role, he will receive a monthly consulting fee of $41,666.67. Mr. Rankin will have the sole discretion to determine the work schedule and the manner in which the consulting services are performed, but in no event will he be required to perform services under the consulting agreement in excess of twenty hours per month. The consulting agreement will continue in effect until January 1, 2020, at which time it will automatically be renewed for successive one year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal to the other party at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the initial term of the agreement or any renewal term. 
For 2019, the Compensation Committee again designated eligible senior management employees in the U.S., including the NEOs, as participants in the Long-Term Equity Plan, while eligible senior management employees outside the U.S. will remain participants in the Long-Term Cash Plan.  PART IV - OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC and the NYSE. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners are required by applicable regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based upon the review of the copies of Section 16(a) forms received by us, and upon written representations from reporting persons concerning the necessity of filing a Form 5 Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, we believe that, during 2018, all filing requirements applicable for reporting persons were met, except for the late reporting of gifts by David F. Taplin to a charitable institution totaling 378 shares of Class A Common, all of which were reported on a Form 4 filed on October 2, 2018.

BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF CLASS A COMMON AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK 
Set forth in the following tables is the indicated information as of February 28, 2019 (except as otherwise indicated) with respect to (1) each person who is known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Class A Common, (2) each person who is known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Class B Common, and (3) the beneficial ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common by our directors, director nominees, NEOs and all of our executive officers, directors and director nominees as a group. Beneficial ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common has been determined for this purpose in accordance with Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the amounts shown in the tables do not purport to represent beneficial ownership for any purpose other than compliance with SEC reporting requirements. Further, beneficial ownership as determined in this manner does not necessarily bear on the economic incidence of ownership of Class A Common or Class B Common. 
Holders of shares of Class A Common and Class B Common are entitled to different voting rights with respect to each class of stock. Each share of Class A Common is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B Common is entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of Class A Common and holders of Class B Common generally vote together as a single class on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Shares of Class B   Common are convertible into shares of Class A Common on a one-for-one basis, without cost, at any time at the option of the holder of the Class B Common.

The NCG Committee has not specifically identified or published qualifications, qualities or skills that our directors must possess. In evaluating director nominees, the NCG Committee will consider such factors as it deems appropriate and other factors identified from time to time by the Board. The NCG Committee will consider factors such as judgment, skill, integrity, independence, possible conflicts of interest, experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable size or character, and the interplay of the candidate's experience and approach to addressing business issues with the experience and approach of incumbent members of the Board and other new director candidates. The NCG Committee's goal in selecting directors for nomination to the Board is generally to seek a well-balanced membership that combines a variety of experience, skill and intellect in order to enable the Company to pursue its strategic objectives. 
The NCG Committee will consider all information provided to it that is relevant to a candidate's nomination as a director of the Company. Following such consideration, the NCG Committee may seek additional information regarding, and may request an interview with, any candidate whom it wishes to continue to consider. Based upon all information available to it and any interviews it may have conducted, the NCG Committee will meet to determine whether to recommend the candidate to the Board. The NCG Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders on the same basis as candidates from other sources. 
The NCG Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors. The NCG Committee regularly reviews the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. In the event vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the NCG Committee will consider various potential candidates. Candidates may be recommended by current members of the Board, third-party search firms or stockholders. No search firm was retained by the NCG Committee during the past fiscal year. The NCG Committee generally does not consider recommendations for director nominees submitted by individuals who are not affiliated with the Company. In order to preserve its impartiality, the NCG Committee may not consider a recommendation that is not submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth above.
