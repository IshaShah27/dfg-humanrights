CORPORATE CONVERSION PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
Dear Unitholders of Hi-Crush Partners LP: 
The board of directors (the "GP Board") of Hi-Crush GP LLC (the "General Partner"), which is the general partner of Hi-Crush Partners LP (the "Partnership"), has unanimously approved a Plan of Conversion (the "Plan of Conversion") that provides for and sets forth matters related to the conversion of the Partnership from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware corporation named "Hi-Crush Inc." (the "Corporation"). The Conversion is to be accomplished through the filing of a Certificate of Conversion (the "Certificate of Conversion") and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Charter") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The transactions contemplated by the Plan of Conversion, including the filing of the Certificate of Conversion and the adoption of the Charter, are referred to collectively as the "Conversion." 
Pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, at the effective time of the Conversion, the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the "Units") will each be exchanged for one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock"). Holders of Units (the "Unitholders") will receive, in exchange for their Units, 100% of the Common Stock to be outstanding immediately following the Conversion. Upon consummation of the Conversion, the Corporation's Common Stock is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HCR." 
After the consummation of the Conversion, the business currently conducted by the Partnership will be conducted by the Corporation with the same operating management, but without involvement by the General Partner or the GP Board. 
If the proposal for Conversion is approved by Unitholders at the special meeting, it is expected that the Conversion will be consummated by the end of the second quarter of 2019. 
The GP Board believes that the Conversion is critical to the future success of the Partnership. With the reduction in the number of master limited partnerships generally and the increased focus of the Partnership's business on logistics, the GP Board believes that the Partnership's assets and growth development plan are no longer best suited for the yield-based master limited partnership sector, and the Conversion enables diversification and enhanced growth potential, while better aligning the corporate structure with the Partnership's business model. The GP Board also believes that the transition to a C-Corp will streamline corporate governance benefitting stockholders with enhanced protections and rights. In addition, the GP Board believes that the Conversion will increase the Partnership's access to, and lower the cost of, capital through an expanded field of investors, as many investors are unwilling or unable to invest in pass-through entities, in many cases, due to the burden and complexities of tax reporting. For further discussion of certain material factors considered with respect to the Conversion, see "The Plan of Conversion—Background of the Conversion" beginning on page 21 and "The Plan of Conversion—Recommendation of the GP Board and Reasons for the Conversion" beginning on page 23. 
The Partnership is holding a special meeting of the Unitholders on April 11, 2019 (the "special meeting"). At the special meeting, Unitholders are being asked to approve the Plan of Conversion, which will constitute approval of the Conversion, and a new equity incentive plan to be used by the Corporation. Information about the special meeting, the Plan of Conversion and the new equity incentive plan is contained in the accompanying proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire proxy statement, including the annexes, carefully. In particular, you should read the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 9 for a description of various risks you should consider in evaluating the proposed Conversion. 
The GP Board has unanimously determined that the Conversion is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Partnership and the Unitholders and has unanimously approved and adopted the Plan of Conversion. The GP Board unanimously recommends that the Unitholders vote FOR the approval of the Plan of Conversion, FOR the approval of the new equity incentive plan and FOR the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the Plan of Conversion or the LTIP Proposal.  
EVERY VOTE IS IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please take the time to vote by following the instructions on your proxy card as soon as possible. If your Units are held in "street name," please instruct your broker or bank how to vote your Units. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING TO BE HELD ON APRIL 11, 2019. 
In accordance with rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the GP Board for the special meeting, we have made the Partnership's proxy materials available to you free of charge on the Internet in addition to delivering paper versions of these materials to you by mail (including the attached Notice of Special Meeting of Unitholders, proxy statement and a form of proxy). Beginning on or about February 22, 2019, these proxy materials are being mailed to the Unitholders and are available on the Internet at https://www.proxy-direct.com/hic-30491. 
Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you at the special meeting. 
NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT, PASSED UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE CONVERSION OR RELATED TRANSACTIONS OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF UNITHOLDERS 
To the Unitholders of Hi-Crush Partners LP: 
A special meeting (the "special meeting") of the holders (the "Unitholders") of common units (the "Units") representing limited partner interests in Hi-Crush Partners LP (the "Partnership") will be held on April 11, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at 1330 Post Oak Blvd., Houston, Texas 77056, for the following purposes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve a Plan of Conversion (the "Plan of Conversion"), a copy  of which is attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement, that provides for and sets forth matters related to the conversion of Partnership from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware corporation named  "Hi-Crush Inc." (the "Corporation"), the filing of a Certificate of Conversion and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware  (the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Conversion, the "Conversion," and such proposal, the "Plan of Conversion Proposal");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Hi-Crush Inc. Long  Term Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to the accompanying proxy statement, to be in effect following the consummation of the Conversion (the "LTIP Proposal"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if presented, to  permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Plan of Conversion Proposal or the LTIP Proposal (the "Adjournment Proposal" and, collectively with the Plan of  Conversion Proposal and the LTIP Proposal, the "Proposals").  
[END TABLE]
The LTIP Proposal will be implemented only if the Plan of Conversion Proposal is approved. 
Approval of the Plan of Conversion Proposal, which constitute approval of the Conversion, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Units. Approval of the LTIP Proposal is being sought to satisfy the equityholder approval policy of the New York Stock Exchange. For these purposes, approval of the LTIP Proposal requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast by the Unitholders represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, requires the approval of a majority of the outstanding Units represented either in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" the Plan of Conversion Proposal, the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, but will have the same effect as a vote "against" the Plan of Conversion Proposal. The votes on each Proposal are separate and apart from the votes on the other Proposals. Accordingly, you may vote to approve certain of the Proposals and vote not to approve other Proposals. 
We cannot complete the Conversion without the approval of the Unitholders. Accordingly, your vote is very important regardless of the number of Units you own. 
The GP Board has approved the Plan of Conversion and determined that the Conversion is fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership and the Unitholders. The GP Board recommends that the Unitholders vote FOR the Plan of Conversion Proposal, FOR the LTIP Proposal and FOR the Adjournment Proposal. 
For more information regarding the recommendation of the GP Board, including the obligations of the GP Board in making such determination under the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement"), see "The Plan of Conversion—Recommendation of the GP Board and Reasons for the Conversion." 
Only Unitholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2019 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. A list of Unitholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at the Partnership's offices in Houston, Texas for any purpose relevant to the special meeting during normal business hours for a period of 10 days before the special meeting, and at the special meeting. 
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. WHETHER OR NOT YOU EXPECT TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING, PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR PROXY IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING WAYS: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you hold your Units in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions  provided by your bank, broker or other nominee when voting your Units.

The Partnership believes that the directors and executive officers of the General Partner will vote in favor of each of the Proposals.

The only proposals for consideration at the special meeting are the Plan of Conversion Proposal, the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment  Proposal, which are non-discretionary matters for which banks, brokers or other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote. To instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, you should  follow the directions that your bank, broker or other nominee provides to you.  
[END TABLE]
Please note that you may not vote your Units held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to the Partnership or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Units, your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote your Units. You should therefore provide your bank, broker or other nominee with instructions as to how to vote your Units. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  When do you expect the Conversion to be consummated?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  The approval of the Plan of Conversion by the Unitholders must occur before the Partnership can complete the  Conversion. Assuming the Plan of Conversion is approved by the Unitholders, we expect to consummate the Conversion as soon as practicable following the special meeting, which is currently expected to be held in the second quarter of 2019.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What if the proposed Conversion is not consummated?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  If the Conversion is not consummated, the Partnership will remain a publicly traded limited partnership. In  addition, the failure to consummate the Conversion may adversely impact the Partnership's business going forward. See "Risk Factors." Whether or not the Conversion is consummated, the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the  Conversion and the solicitation of proxies for use at the special meeting will be paid in full by the Partnership.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How does the GP Board recommend that the Unitholders vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  The GP Board recommends that Unitholders vote FOR the Plan of Conversion Proposal, FOR the LTIP Proposal and  FOR the Adjournment Proposal.  
[END TABLE]
The GP Board has determined that the Conversion is fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership and the Unitholders, approved the Plan of Conversion, resolved to submit the Plan of Conversion to a vote of the Unitholders and recommends approval of the Plan of Conversion by the Unitholders. For more information regarding the recommendation of the GP Board, including the obligations of the GP Board in making such determination under the Partnership Agreement, see "The Plan of Conversion—Recommendation of the GP Board and Reasons for the Conversion."  Q:    What are the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Unitholder as a result of the Conversion? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  The receipt of Common Stock in exchange for Units pursuant to the Conversion is intended to constitute a  liquidating partnership distribution under Section 731 of the Code for U.S. holders (as defined in the section titled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, U.S. holders are  not expected to recognize gain as a result of the liquidating partnership distribution except to the extent that the Partnership's liabilities allocated to a Unitholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes exceed such Unitholder's tax  basis in its Units. Based on analysis performed, the GP Board does not believe that the Partnership liabilities allocated to any Unitholder should be in excess of such Unitholder's tax basis in its Units. See "Material U.S. Federal Income  Tax Consequences" for a more complete discussion of the expected material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Conversion.  
[END TABLE]
Q:    What are the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences for a Unitholder of the ownership of Common Stock after the Conversion is completed? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  The Corporation will be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will be subject to  U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income. As such, other than as described below with respect to tax reporting for the 2018 tax year and the 2019 short tax year, Schedule K-1 tax reporting will no longer  be required. Following the completion of the Conversion, future distributions of cash by the Corporation to a Stockholder who is a U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences") generally  will be included in such U.S. holder's income as ordinary dividend income to the extent of the Corporation's current or accumulated "earnings and profits" as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles and will be  reported to such holder on a Form 1099-DIV. A portion of cash distributed to a U.S. holder by the Corporation after the Conversion may exceed the Corporation's current or accumulated earnings and profits.  Distributions of cash in excess of the Corporation's current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital reducing a U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its  Common Stock and, to the extent the distribution exceeds such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis, as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such Common Stock. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" for a more complete  discussion of the expected material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion.  
[END TABLE]
Q:    Will Unitholders continue to receive Schedule K-1s after the Conversion is completed? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  The Partnership will provide Schedule K-1s to the Unitholders to report  their tax information with respect to their ownership of the Units for periods prior to the Conversion, including the Partnership's 2018 tax year and the Partnership's 2019 short tax year ending on the date of the Conversion. The  Partnership expects to deliver the Schedule K-1s for the 2018 tax year in March 2019 and the Schedule K-1s for the 2019 short tax year in March 2020. As described above,  distributions of cash following the Conversion by the Corporation to Stockholders who are U.S. holders will be reported to such holders on a Form 1099-DIV.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Are Unitholders entitled to appraisal rights or dissenters' rights?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  No. The Unitholders are not entitled to appraisal rights or dissenters' rights in connection with the  Conversion under applicable law.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What if I do not vote or abstain?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  If you do not vote in person or by proxy or a broker non-vote is made,  it will be deemed to not be a vote cast with respect to any of the Proposals and will have no effect on the LTIP Proposal and the

Q:  If I am planning to attend the special meeting in person, should I still vote by proxy?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  Yes. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, you should vote by proxy. Your Units will not be  voted if you do not vote by proxy or do not vote in person at the special meeting, as applicable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who may attend the special meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Q:  Can I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  Yes. If you own your Units in your own name, you may revoke your proxy at any time prior to its exercise by:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the General Partner before the special meeting;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appearing and voting in person at the special meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• properly completing and executing a later dated proxy and delivering it to the Secretary of the General Partner  at or before the special meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Your presence without voting at the special meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy, and any revocation during the meeting will not affect votes previously taken. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting, and the materials may include  multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold Units. Additionally, if you are a holder of record registered in more than one name, you  will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive according to the instructions on it.

In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, you should carefully consider the following risks before deciding whether to vote for the approval of the applicable Proposals described in this proxy statement. In addition, you should read and carefully consider the risks associated with the Partnership and its business. These risks can be found in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. For further information regarding the documents incorporated into this proxy statement by reference, please see the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 67 of this proxy statement. Realization of any of the risks described below or any of the risks or events described in the documents incorporated by reference could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of the Partnership or, following the Conversion, the Corporation, and could result in a decline in the trading prices of the Units or the Common Stock. 
Risks Related to the Conversion 
Failure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Conversion could negatively affect the trading prices of Units and the future business and financial results of the Partnership. 
Completion of the Conversion is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risk that approval of the Plan of Conversion Proposal by the Unitholders is not obtained. If the Conversion is not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the Conversion, the trading prices of Units and the future business and financial results of the Partnership could be negatively affected, and the Partnership will be subject to several risks, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• negative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the prices of Units due to the fact that  current prices may reflect a market assumption that the Conversion will be completed; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the attention of management of the Partnership will have been diverted to the Conversion rather than its own  operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the Partnership.  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders may not receive any dividends or may not receive the anticipated level of dividends under the anticipated dividend policy. 
The terms of any dividend policy that the New Board may adopt are not currently determined, and any dividend policy adopted may be amended, revoked or suspended at any time. Even while any dividend policy is in place, the actual amount of dividends on the Common Stock will depend on many factors, including the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws and other factors. 
Over time, the Corporation's capital and other cash needs may change significantly from its current needs, which could affect whether the Corporation pays dividends and the amount of any dividends it may pay in the future. The level of indebtedness of the Corporation may also restrict it from paying cash dividends on its stock under certain circumstances. A decline in the market price or liquidity, or both, of the Common Stock could result if the New Board commits capital or establishes large reserves that reduce the amounts that could be paid as quarterly dividends paid or if the Corporation reduces or eliminates the payment of any dividends. This may in turn result in losses by the Stockholders, which could be substantial.  Risk Factors Relating to the Ownership of Hi-Crush Inc. Common Stock 
The price of Common Stock may be volatile, and Stockholders could lose a significant portion of their investments. 
The market price of the Common Stock could be volatile, and Stockholders may not be able to resell their Common Stock at or above the price at which they acquired the corresponding Units due to fluctuations in the market price of the Common Stock, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to the Corporation's operating performance or prospects. 
Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for the Common Stock include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Corporation's operating and financial performance and prospects and the trading price of the Common  Stock; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Corporation's dividend policy and the level of any dividends declared by the  Corporation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• quarterly variations in the rate of growth of the Corporation's financial indicators, such as free cash flow  per share of Common Stock, net income and revenues; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• levels and maturity dates of the Corporation's indebtedness; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in estimates of the Corporation's revenue or earnings or publication of research reports relating to  the Corporation by analysts; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• speculation by the press or investment community relating to the Corporation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• purchases or sales of Common Stock by Stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• announcements by the Corporation or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic  partnerships, joint ventures, securities offerings or capital commitments; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• general market conditions;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• adverse changes in tax laws or regulations; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors related to the Corporation's performance.   
[END TABLE]
There may be future dilution of the Common Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of the Common Stock. 
The Corporation is not restricted from issuing additional shares of Common Stock. In the future, the Corporation may issue shares of Common Stock to raise cash for future activities, acquisitions or other purposes. The Corporation may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock or just shares of Common Stock. The Corporation may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of Common Stock. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of Stockholders in the Corporation, reduce the Corporation's earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of shares of the Common Stock. 
Sales of a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of shares of the Common Stock. 
Sales of a substantial amount of shares of Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of shares of the Common Stock. The Common Stock will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless the shares are held by   any of the Corporation's "affiliates" as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The size of future issuances of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock is unpredictable, as is the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of Common Stock will have on the market price of the Common Stock. 
Upon receiving Common Stock as a result of the Conversion, the Stockholders will have different rights than the rights they currently have as Unitholders. 
Following completion of the Conversion, the Unitholders will no longer hold Units, but will instead be Stockholders and hold Common Stock. The Corporation will be a corporation, and the Partnership is a limited partnership. There are important differences between the rights of Unitholders and the rights of Stockholders. See "Comparison of the Rights of Stockholders and Unitholders" for a discussion of the different rights associated with the Units and the Common Stock. 
The Charter and the Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, will contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock. 
Certain provisions of the Charter and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Corporation, even if the change of control would be beneficial to Stockholders. Among other things, the Charter and Bylaws will: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide advance notice procedures with regard to Stockholder nominations of candidates for election as directors  or other Stockholder proposals to be brought before meetings of Stockholders, which may preclude Stockholders from bringing certain matters before the Stockholders at an annual or special meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide the New Board the ability to authorize issuance of preferred stock in one or more series, which makes it  possible for the New Board to issue, without Stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the Corporation and which may have the effect of  deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of the Corporation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the New  Board; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide that, subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors or fill  vacancies in respect of such directors as specified in the related preferred stock designation, all vacancies, including newly created directorships, be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of directors then in office, even if  less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and will not be filled by Stockholders; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors under  specified circumstances, if any, any action required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of Stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of  such Stockholders; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide for the New Board to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in  number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms until the 2023 annual meeting of Stockholders. Commencing with the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of Stockholders, the directors will be divided into two classes, with each  class subsequently serving staggered two-year terms, and commencing with the Classified Board Expiration Date, the directors will consist of a single class, with all directors subsequently serving one-year terms;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock, if any, to remove  directors elected by such series of preferred stock pursuant to the Charter (including any preferred stock designation thereunder), prior to the Classified Board Expiration Date directors may be removed from office at any time, only for cause and by  the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding voting shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Upon the Classified Board Expiration Date and thereafter, any director, or the entire New Board, may be removed  from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide that special meetings of Stockholders may only be called by the New Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide that the provisions of the Charter can only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of a least a  majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon; and  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Tax Risks Related to the Conversion and the Ownership of Common Stock Received in Connection with the Conversion 
The U.S. federal income tax treatment to Unitholders with respect to owning and disposing of any shares of Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion will be different than the U.S. federal income tax treatment to them with respect to owning and disposing of their Units. 
The Partnership is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not generally subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, each Unitholder is required to take into account such Unitholder's share of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction of the Partnership in computing its U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such Unitholder by the Partnership. A distribution of cash by the Partnership to a Unitholder who is a U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences") is generally not taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the amount of cash distributed is in excess of the Unitholder's adjusted tax basis in its Units. Gain or loss recognized by a Unitholder who is a U.S. holder in connection with the disposition of its Units will generally be capital gain or loss. However, a portion of such gain or loss, which portion could be substantial, is separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under Section 751 of the Code to the extent attributable to assets giving rise to depreciation recapture or other "unrealized receivables" or to "inventory items" owned by the Partnership and its subsidiaries. Consequently, a Unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss in connection with a disposition of its Units. 
In contrast, the Corporation will be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and thus the Corporation (and not its Stockholders) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income. Distributions with respect to Common Stock by the Corporation to a Stockholder who is a U.S. holder will generally be included in such U.S. holder's income as dividend income to the extent paid from the Corporation's current or accumulated "earnings and profits" as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds the Corporation's current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distribution will first be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of (and reducing, but not below zero) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock and thereafter will be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such Common Stock. A Stockholder who is a U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on a disposition of its Common Stock. 
Please read "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" for a more complete discussion of the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Common Stock.  INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Time, Place and Date 
The special meeting will be held on April 11, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at 1330 Post Oak Blvd., Houston, Texas 77056. 
Proposal 1: The Plan of Conversion Proposal 
As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Unitholders are being asked at the special meeting to approve the Plan of Conversion, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, that provides for and sets forth matters related to the conversion of the Partnership from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware corporation. Unitholders should carefully read this proxy statement, including the annexes, in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the Conversion. Approval of the Plan of Conversion Proposal will constitute approval of the Conversion. 
The GP Board unanimously recommends that Unitholders vote FOR approval of the Plan of Conversion Proposal. 
Proposal 2: The LTIP Proposal 
At the annual meeting, the Unitholders are being asked to approve the LTIP, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement, to be in effect following the consummation of the Conversion. For a more detailed summary of the terms of the LTIP, see "Description of the Hi-Crush Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan." 
The GP Board recommends that Unitholders vote FOR approval of the LTIP Proposal. 
Proposal 3: The Adjournment Proposal 
Unitholders are being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies in the event there are insufficient votes in favor of the Plan of Conversion Proposal or the LTIP Proposal. 
The GP Board recommends that the Unitholders vote FOR approval of the Adjournment Proposal. 
The Unitholders may also be asked to consider other matters as may properly come before the special meeting. At this time, the Partnership and the General Partner know of no other matters that will be presented for the consideration of the Unitholders at the special meeting. 
Quorum 
The holders of more than 50% of the outstanding Units on the record date, present in person or by proxy at the special meeting, will constitute a quorum and will permit the Partnership to conduct the proposed business at the special meeting. 
Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be counted as Units that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting. If an executed proxy is returned by a broker or other nominee holding Units in "street name" indicating that the broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority as to certain Units to vote on the Proposals, such Units will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be considered entitled to vote.  Record Date 
The Unitholder record date for the special meeting is the close of business on February 19, 2019. Unitholders may vote at the Special Meeting if they owned Units at the close of business on the record date. Unitholders may cast one vote for each Unit owned on the record date. 
Votes Required 
Approval of the Plan of Conversion Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Units. Approval of the LTIP Proposal is being sought to satisfy the equityholder approval policy of the NYSE. For these purposes, approval of the LTIP Proposal requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast by the Unitholders represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, requires the approval of a majority of the outstanding Units represented either in person or by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" the Plan of Conversion Proposal, the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, but will have the same effect as a vote "against" the Plan of Conversion Proposal. The votes on each Proposal are separate and apart from the votes on the other Proposals. Accordingly, you may vote to approve certain of the Proposals and vote not to approve other Proposals. 
All of the directors and executive officers of the General Partner beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 5% of the outstanding Units as of the record date. The Partnership believes that the directors and executive officers of the General Partner will vote in favor of the Plan of Conversion Proposal, in favor of the LTIP Proposal and in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. 
Units Outstanding 
As of February 19, 2019, the record date for the special meeting, there were 101,062,399 Units outstanding held by 13 holders of record. Each outstanding Unit entitles its holder of record to one vote on each matter considered at the special meeting. The Units are the only class of securities entitled to vote at the special meeting, and the Unitholders are entitled to vote on the Plan of Conversion Proposal, the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. 
A complete list of registered Unitholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of Hi-Crush Partners LP, 1330 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77056 for a period of at least 10 days before the special meeting and at the place of the special meeting for the duration of the meeting. 
Adjournments 
At the special meeting, in addition to asking the Unitholders to approve the Plan of Conversion Proposal and the LTIP Proposal, the Unitholders are also being asked to vote upon the Adjournment Proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, for the GP Board to solicit additional votes or proxies in favor of the Plan of Conversion Proposal if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Plan of Conversion Proposal or the LTIP Proposal. If it is deemed necessary or appropriate to adjourn the special meeting, no notice of the adjourned meeting is required to be given to Unitholders, other than an announcement at the special meeting of the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned, unless a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case notice of the place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given to persons who are Unitholders as of the new record date. 
The Partnership is asking its Unitholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the GP Board on a discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from Unitholders who have previously voted.  Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, in the absence of a quorum, the special meeting may be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the Unitholders holding a majority of the Units entitled to vote at the special meeting (including any Units deemed owned by the General Partner) represented either in person or by proxy. 
Upon an adjournment to a date within 45 days of the special meeting, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new record date need not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced at the special meeting. At the adjourned special meeting, the Partnership may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original special meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned special meeting, a notice of the adjourned special meeting shall be given to all Unitholders as of the new record date. 
Voting Procedure 
Voting by Unitholders. If you are a Unitholder who holds Units in your own name, you may submit your proxy using any of the following methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• call the toll-free telephone number listed on your proxy card and follow the recorded instructions;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• go to the Internet website listed on your proxy card and follow the instructions provided;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• complete, sign and mail your proxy card in the postage-paid envelope; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attend the special meeting and vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
If you have timely and properly submitted your proxy, clearly indicated your vote and have not revoked your proxy, your Units will be voted as indicated. If you have timely and properly submitted your proxy but have not clearly indicated your vote, your Units will be voted FOR the Plan of Plan of Conversion Proposal, FOR the LTIP Proposal and FOR the Adjournment Proposal. 
Revocation. If you hold your Units in your own name, you may revoke your proxy at any time prior to its exercise by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the General Partner at or before the special meeting;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appearing and voting in person at the special meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• properly completing and executing a later dated proxy and delivering it to the Secretary of the General Partner  at or before the special meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Your presence without voting at the special meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy, and any revocation during the special meeting will not affect votes previously taken. 
Validity. The inspectors of election will determine all questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of proxies. Their determination will be final and binding. The GP Board has the right to waive any irregularities or conditions as to the manner of voting. The Partnership may accept your proxy by any form of communication permitted by applicable law so long as the Partnership is reasonably assured that the communication is authorized by you. 
Solicitation of Proxies. The Partnership is furnishing this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy to you to solicit your proxy for the special meeting. The expenses of preparing, printing and mailing the proxy and materials used in the solicitation will be borne by the Partnership. 
Georgeson has been retained by the Partnership to aid in the solicitation of proxies for an initial fee of $15,000 and the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. The Partnership has also agreed to indemnify   Georgeson against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). In addition to the mailing of this proxy statement, proxies may also be solicited from Unitholders by personal interview, telephone, fax or other electronic means by directors and officers of the General Partner and employees of affiliates of the Partnership who provide services to the Partnership, who will not receive additional compensation for performing that service. Arrangements also will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Units held by those persons, and the Partnership will reimburse them for any reasonable expenses that they incur. 
Units Held in "Street Name". If you hold Units in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee when voting your Units or when granting or revoking a proxy. 
As a general rule, absent specific instructions from you, your bank, broker or other nominee is not allowed to vote your Units on any Proposal on which your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority. The only proposals for consideration at the special meeting are the Plan of Conversion Proposal, the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, which are non-discretionary matters for which banks, brokers and other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote. To instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, you should follow the directions that your bank, broker or other nominee provides to you. 
Please note that you may not vote your Units held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to the Partnership or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your Units, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your Units, it will be deemed to not be a vote cast with respect to any of the Proposals and will have no effect on the LTIP Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, but it will have the same effect as a vote "against" the Plan of Conversion Proposal. You should therefore provide your bank, broker or other nominee with instructions as to how to vote your Units. 
No Appraisal Rights 
The Unitholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Conversion. 
Representatives of the Principal Accountants at the Special Meeting 
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the special meeting. The representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will have the opportunity to make a statement at the special meeting if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Householding of Proxy Statement 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more Unitholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those Unitholders. As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to Unitholders residing at the same address, unless the Unitholders have notified the Partnership whose Units they hold of their desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement. This process, which is commonly referred to in this proxy statement as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for Unitholders and cost savings for companies.  If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate copy of this proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please follow these instructions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Units are registered in the name of the Unitholder, please contact the Partnership at 1330 Post Oak Blvd.,  Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77056 to inform the Partnership of his or her request; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If a bank, broker or other nominee holds the Units, the Unitholder should contact the bank, broker or other  nominee directly.  
[END TABLE]
 THE PLAN OF CONVERSION 
Overview 
The principal effects of the Conversion will be that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The affairs of the Partnership will cease to be governed by the Delaware LP Act and, following the Conversion,  will become subject to the DGCL.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Corporation will continue with all of the rights, privileges and powers of the Partnership, will possess all  of the properties of the Partnership, will continue with all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Partnership and will continue with the same officers and directors of the General Partner immediately prior to the Conversion, as more  fully described below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• When the Conversion becomes effective, each outstanding Unit will be exchanged for one share of Common Stock, and  each outstanding option or right to acquire Units will be an option or right to acquire, on the same terms, shares of Common Stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Partnership will convert from an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes to an  entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Corporation will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income, and the Stockholders will be subject to simplified tax reporting obligations for  U.S. federal income tax purposes. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences." for a more complete discussion of the expected material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Conversion.  
[END TABLE]
The Partnership will effect the Conversion by entering into the Plan of Conversion, a copy of which is attached as Annex A. Approval of the Plan of Conversion Proposal will constitute approval of the Conversion. At the effective time of the Conversion, the Partnership will file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the Certificate of Conversion and the Charter that would govern Hi-Crush as a Delaware corporation, copies of which are attached to the Plan of Conversion. In addition, the New Board will adopt the Bylaws for the Corporation, a copy of which is attached as Annex B. 
Although it will be governed by the Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL, the Corporation will continue with all of the rights, privileges and powers of the Partnership, it will possess all of the properties of the Partnership, it will continue with all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Partnership and it will continue with the same officers and directors as the General Partner immediately prior to the Conversion. 
After the Conversion, the Partnership will continue to be a publicly-held entity and the shares of Common Stock will be traded, without interruption, on the NYSE under the symbol "HCR." The Corporation will continue to file periodic reports and other documents with the SEC and provide to its Stockholders the same type of information that it has previously filed and provided by the Partnership. The Unitholders who own Units that are freely tradable prior to the Conversion will hold shares of Common Stock that will continue to be freely tradable, and Unitholders holding restricted Units immediately prior to the Conversion will hold shares of Common Stock that continue to be subject to the same restrictions on transfer to which their Units were subject. In summary, the Conversion will not change the respective positions under federal securities laws of the Partnership or the Unitholders. 
The Partnership 
The Partnership was formed on May 8, 2012 to acquire selected sand reserves and related processing and transportation facilities of its former sponsor, Proppants, which was managed and majority owned by certain affiliates of Avista Capital Partners, L.P. (collectively, "Avista"). In connection with its formation, the Partnership issued a non-economic general partner interest to the General Partner and a 100% limited partner interest to Proppants, the Partnership's organizational limited partner.  In August 2012, the Partnership completed its initial public offering through the sale of Units held by Proppants. In connection with its initial public offering, the Partnership issued additional Units, subordinated units and all of its IDRs to Proppants and, in return, Proppants contributed to the Partnership cash and its ownership of sand reserves and related excavation and processing facilities located in Wyeville, Wisconsin. 
In June 2013, the Partnership acquired D&I Silica, LLC ("D&I"), the owner of the largest distribution network in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. The foundation of this acquisition enabled the Partnership to operate through an extensive logistics network of rail-based terminals, which today, has been expanded and is strategically located throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Colorado and New York. In separate transactions from 2013 to 2017, the Partnership acquired all of the equity interests in the Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities from Proppants. In March 2017, the Partnership acquired a 1,226-acre frac sand reserve, located near Kermit, Texas, from Permian Basin Sand Company, LLC. In August 2018, the Partnership acquired FB Industries Inc. ("FB Industries"), a company which engages in the engineering, design and marketing of silo-based frac sand management systems. The Partnership expects to continue pursuing accretive acquisitions of third-party frac sand assets, including production facilities and/or distribution and logistics operations. As the Partnership evaluates acquisition opportunities, it intends to remain focused on operations that complement its reserves of premium frac sand, portfolio of efficient production facilities, and assets that provide or would accommodate the development and construction of advantaged logistics and distribution capabilities. The Partnership believes these factors are critical to its business model and are important characteristics for any potential acquisitions. 
Today, the Partnership is a fully integrated, strategic provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American petroleum industry. The Partnership provides mine-to-wellsite logistics services that optimize proppant supply to customers in all major oil and gas basins in the United States, and owns and operates multiple frac sand mining facilities and in-basin terminals. The Partnership's PropStream® service, offering both container- and silo-based wellsite delivery and storage systems, provides the highest level of flexibility, safety and efficiency in managing the full scope and value of the proppant supply chain. 
Background of the Conversion 
At the time of the initial public offering, the Partnership was a pure play, low-cost, domestic producer of proppant used to enhance the recovery rates of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Substantially all of the Partnership's frac sand production was sold to leading investment grade-rated pressure pumping service providers under long-term, take-or-pay contracts that required customers to pay a specified price for a specified volume of frac sand each month. The nature of these contracts and the assets producing the proppant served the master limited partnership ("MLP") business model well. 
Following its initial public offering, a number of external factors contributed to the Partnership from time to time evaluating potential transactions that would further its strategic objectives. The most influential were certain market forces, including the impact on the Partnership of the dynamic nature of the demand for proppants, which is predominantly influenced by the level of drilling and completions activity by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies ("E&P companies"), which, in turn, depends largely on the current and anticipated profitability of developing oil and natural gas reserves. 
Through 2014, growth in the use of horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic fracturing dramatically increased onshore oil and gas activity in North America and contributed to substantial growth in demand for proppants from 2009 to 2014. In 2015, due to the increasing global supply of oil and slowing growth of global oil demand, crude oil prices declined, which caused various E&P companies to reduce capital programs, resulting in significantly reduced completion activity. This volatility and cyclicality in U.S. onshore oil and natural gas resulted in reduced demand for proppants throughout 2015 and 2016. In 2017, prices for oil rebounded and the market experienced a turnaround as oilfield activity increased significantly, which caused an increase in demand for proppant across most basins. The increased demand, which generally held steady through the first half of   2018, resulted in market pricing rising for proppants throughout this period. As market conditions and demand for proppant improved, unprecedented levels of competition entered the market. As a result, frac sand production increased overall, injecting significant downward forces on the price for such products. 
This market volatility directly impacted the distributable cash flow of the Partnership and therefore the timing and nature of the Partnership's cash distributions. In October 2015, the Partnership announced a temporary suspension of its quarterly distribution due to challenging market conditions and pricing pressures and, while the Partnership reinstated its distributions in October 2017, a weakened industry environment resulted in quarterly distributions that were suppressed as compared to historical levels until July 2018. In January 2019, the Partnership again suspended its quarterly distribution. 
As noted above, from June 2013 with the acquisition of D&I through August 2018 with the acquisition of FB Industries, the Partnership has pursued accretive acquisitions of third-party frac sand assets, including production facilities and/or distribution and logistics operations. The Partnership's business model has evolved from a producer of frac sand with substantially all production sold at the mine gate to a fully integrated, strategic provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American petroleum industry with volumes and services sold throughout the U.S at the mine gate, the terminal and the wellsite. 
More broadly, the landscape for MLPs has changed considerably since May 2017. The Alerian MLP Index (the "AMZ"), a leading gauge of energy MLPs whose constituents represent approximately 75% of total energy MLP market capitalization, and another MLP index, the AMZX, have decreased since their peak in August 2014 to December 31, 2018 by 59% and 44%, respectively. The drop in the values of MLPs over that time period, combined with the effects of growing cash flows and distributions, has increased the cost of capital burden of IDRs to many MLPs, making it difficult for MLPs to buy or develop assets that are accretive to their cash flow. Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which reduced the overall tax burden on cash flows distributed from an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These trends have contributed to a significant number of MLPs eliminating their IDRs, directly or through mergers with the entities holding their IDRs, converting to corporations (for U.S. federal income tax and state law purposes) or both. 
In light of these circumstances, at a meeting of the GP Board on September 13, 2016, the GP Board commenced discussions with Lazard Freres & Co. LLC ("Lazard") and Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. ("V&E") surrounding the viability and potential benefits of the Partnership converting to a corporation and related matters. Following the meeting, throughout 2016 and 2017, the GP Board continued to evaluate courses of action available to align the Partnership's capital and organizational structure with Hi-Crush's long-term objectives. From March 2017 to October 2017, the GP Board reviewed and held multiple meetings to discuss presentations and written materials prepared by Lazard detailing the risks and benefits of a conversion and various alternatives for precedent transactions necessary for a conversion, such as the sale of interests in the General Partner and Proppants. Based on this extensive evaluation process and related consultations with V&E and Lazard, the GP Board determined that pursuing conversion to a corporation would be in the best interests of Hi-Crush and its future growth and, in connection with such pursuit, decided to engage in discussions with Avista regarding potential precursor transactions involving the sale of interests in the General Partner and Proppants to third parties or the Partnership. 
During the second half of 2017, Avista engaged Lazard to market the sale of all of the outstanding membership interests in Proppants (the "Proppants Interests") or the interest in the General Partner to potential third party acquirers. Pursuant to this engagement, from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018, Avista had several discussions, and in some cases took part in significant negotiation of documentation, with third parties related to such a sale. Following this process and Avista's evaluation of these opportunities in consultation with Lazard, in light of various factors, including strategic alternatives that may be available and the anticipated relative value of each option, such opportunities were ultimately not consummated. 
From September 29, 2018 through October 21, 2018, the Partnership, represented by a Conflicts Committee of the Partnership and consisting of three independent directors, along with Jefferies LLC and the law firm of   Latham and Watkins LLP as advisors, negotiated with Proppants, Hi-Crush Augusta Acquisition Co. LLC and the Proppants Equityholders and ultimately reached terms of the agreements facilitating the proposed contribution transaction. On October 21, 2018, the Partnership, Proppants, Hi-Crush Augusta Acquisition Co. LLC and the Proppants Equityholders entered into a Contribution Agreement (the "Contribution Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Proppants Equityholders contributed the Proppants Interests to the Partnership in exchange for an aggregate of 11,000,000 Units, (ii) all of the outstanding IDRs were cancelled and extinguished, (iii) the Partnership indirectly acquired the General Partner and its non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership, (iv) Proppants waived any and all rights to receive earnout payments from the Partnership and its subsidiaries pursuant to certain previously entered into contribution agreements to which Proppants was a party and (v) each of Avista's representatives on the GP Board resigned. 
On October 22, 2018, the Partnership issued a press release announcing its acquisition of Proppants and the General Partner and the Partnership's intention to undertake additional strategic steps in its progress towards becoming a corporation in 2019, including the GP Board's declaration of a reduced cash distribution for the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the previous quarterly cash distribution, with the stated goal of aligning the Partnership's cash distributions to a level more consistent with a growth-focused corporation. Having consummated the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, a necessary step in the path to conversion to corporate form, the Partnership determined to pursue the final steps towards that objective. 
Recommendation of the GP Board and Reasons for the Conversion 
In reaching its determinations and recommendations described above, the GP Board consulted with the Partnership's senior management, outside legal counsel and financial and tax advisors. These consultations included discussions regarding the Partnership's strategic business plan, the Partnership's past and current business operations and financial condition and performance, the Partnership's future prospects, other potential strategic alternatives that may be available to the Partnership, and the potential Conversion. The GP Board considered a number of substantive factors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and detriments of the Conversion to the Partnership and the Unitholders. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with the Conversion, the GP Board did not consider it practicable to assign relative weights to the specific material factors it considered in reaching its decision. Certain material factors considered by the GP Board, in addition to the matters described above under "—Background of the Conversion," are summarized below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance). 
Expected Benefits of the Conversion 
In determining that the Conversion is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Partnership and the Unitholders, and in reaching its decision to approve the Plan of Conversion, the GP Board considered a variety of factors that it believed weighed favorably toward the Conversion, including the following material factors: 
Enables Diversification and Better Aligns Corporate Structure with Hi-Crush's Business Model. Since the Partnership's formation, it has continued to evolve with the changing dynamics of the frac sand industry. The Partnership intends to continue positioning itself as a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry, as it believes the proppant and logistics market offers attractive growth fundamentals over the long-term. The Partnership will continue to analyze and pursue organic expansion efforts that will similarly allow it to capitalize on and cost-effectively optimize its existing production and logistics assets. In addition, the Partnership seeks to identify and evaluate additional terminal site locations to expand its geographic footprint allowing it to enhance its distribution network and ensure that its frac sand production is available to meet the evolving and dynamic in-basin needs of customers. Further, the Partnership seeks to find ways to reduce its customers' cost of frac sand delivered to the blender at the wellsite regardless of the source of production. The Partnership intends to accomplish this through a combination of its low cost production, network of owned and operated terminals or third-party operated sites, its geographic footprint, and its PropStream integrated logistics service. The Partnership's contracting strategy seeks to secure a high percentage of its   volumes under long-term contracts with E&P companies and major pressure pumping service providers. This strategy serves as the foundation for its ability to serve customers, while reliably providing proppant supply, a critical component to the well completion process. 
Under current law, the Partnership is required to satisfy the "qualifying income" requirement under Section 7704 of the Code to maintain its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, to satisfy the qualifying income requirement, the Partnership must generate 90 percent or more of its gross income from qualifying activities with respect to minerals or natural resources. From time to time, the Partnership has evaluated acquisitions that might not generate qualifying income. By converting into an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the qualifying income constraint to pursuing favorable and potentially accretive business acquisitions in furtherance of the Partnership's strategic expansion efforts would be eliminated. 
In October 2018, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Proppants and the General Partner, simplifying the corporate structure consistent with the strategic plan to move towards a corporate conversion. The GP Board believes the advantages of doing business in corporate form are further demonstrated by the fact that in similar simplification transactions, many MLPs have recently chosen to forego continued organization as a partnership in favor of some form of conversion to corporate form. 
Enhanced Growth Potential. The Partnership expects to continue pursuing accretive acquisitions of third-party frac sand assets, including production facilities and/or distribution and logistics operations. As it evaluates acquisition opportunities, the Partnership intends to remain focused on operations that complement its reserves of premium frac sand, portfolio of efficient production facilities, and assets that provide or would accommodate the development and construction of advantaged logistics and distribution capabilities. 
The GP Board believes that current industry conditions may provide opportunities for Hi-Crush to grow through acquisitions of businesses and assets. In certain cases, Hi-Crush may seek to issue equity securities in payment of the purchase price for such acquisitions, and the GP Board believes that in certain circumstances that equity interests in a corporation will be a more attractive acquisition currency to prospective sellers than the Units. From time to time, the Partnership contacts and is contacted by others concerning the acquisition by the Partnership of assets of others in complementary lines of business. Occasionally, the sellers of such assets might have been willing to consider receiving equity of Hi-Crush in payment of the asset purchase price if the Partnership were converted to a corporation. None of these potential transactions progressed to the stage of an agreement in principle and no discussions are currently taking place concerning the issuance of Hi-Crush's equity in payment of the purchase price of businesses or assets. 
Streamlines Corporate Governance and Benefits Stockholders. The complexities of the status quo organizational structure of the Partnership and its subsidiaries will be meaningfully reduced as a result of the Conversion, thereby streamlining corporate governance matters. For example, in connection with the Conversion, the Corporation will have a customary corporate governance model, with the Corporation's directors and officers subject to corporate fiduciary duties. In general, the traditional C-Corp structure of the Corporation will also provide valuable governance protections and enhanced stockholder rights for the Stockholders that are not currently available to Unitholders. See "Comparison of the Rights of Stockholders and Unitholders" and "Description of Hi-Crush Inc.'s Capital Stock." 
Improved Access to Capital Markets and Expansion of Investor Base. The GP Board expects the Corporation will benefit from a simpler and more readily understandable capital structure that should result in improved access to capital markets than the Partnership currently has, potentially enabling the Corporation to raise capital on more favorable terms than are now available to the Partnership. In this regard, the GP Board believes that the Corporation's structure will significantly increase the potential, over time, for the Corporation to be eligible for inclusion in a broader base of indices, which would further expand the universe of investors and enhance financial valuation and flexibility relative to the Partnership today. Inclusion in a broader base of indices   would expand the investor base to generalists and passive investors. Further, the GP Board expects that the Conversion should ultimately expand the Corporation's potential investor base to a broader array of investors (e.g., pension plans, mutual funds, other institutional investors and foreign investors) that face prohibitions or limitations on investing in entities other than corporations or investors that have a preference for traditional C-Corp structures and governance. In addition, the GP Board anticipates that the Common Stock (as compared to the Units) should receive broadened investor interest through increased review and evaluation by investment research analysts. Finally, the GP Board believes the C-Corp structure would result in greater trading liquidity, also attractive to many investors that often require certain thresholds of trading activity. The GP Board anticipates that these factors could enable access to lower cost of capital to fund future growth and an improved credit profile. Although there can be no assurance in this regard, such factors should result in greater activity and liquidity for the Common Stock as compared to the status quo. 
Corporate Sector Presents a Superior Environment for the Future of Hi-Crush. The GP Board believes investor confidence in the MLP sector has eroded and that the Partnership's assets and growth development plan are no longer best suited for the yield-based MLP sector. The number of publicly traded MLPs has decreased over time from over 135 in 2015 to less than 90 as of December 31, 2018 due to consolidations and corporate conversions. The AMZ and AMZX have decreased since their peak in August 2014 to December 31, 2018 by 59% and 44%, respectively. In contrast, the GP Board views the corporate sector as providing a healthier and more supportive environment for Hi-Crush to attain future growth and execute its long-term business plans. The GP Board also believes the Conversion allows for better valuation comparability by investors of Hi-Crush and its direct public peers. 
Anticipated Increase in the Ratio of Taxable Income to Cash Distributions. The ratio of the Partnership's allocable taxable income to cash distributions is anticipated to increase over time. Distributions to Unitholders have been volatile in the past, and the Partnership is uncertain as to when it would be able to resume or increase cash distributions, in part due to volatile market conditions. Additionally, because the Partnership's continued growth has required and continues to require reinvesting significant amounts of cash in its business, the Partnership may not increase its cash distributions to Unitholders in the event of distribution resumption, even if the taxable income allocable to Unitholders by the Partnership increases over time. Accordingly, the GP Board expects that absent the Conversion and assuming continued income growth in 2019 and subsequent years, Unitholders might not receive cash distributions from the Partnership equal to their share of the Partnership's taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due from them with respect to that income. This ratio of taxable income to cash distributions will be greater for those Unitholders that have held Units for longer periods of time or that purchased their Units at lower prices. Increases in allocable taxable income are likely to correspond to increases in book income of the Partnership which, for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by over 80% compared to the same period in 2017. 
Reduces Burdens of Tax Reporting. The GP Board believes that the complexities of tax reporting associated with entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including the Schedule K-1 reporting requirement, are regarded as unduly burdensome by many institutional and retail Unitholders. In addition to U.S. federal income tax reporting requirements, Unitholders are generally required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay foreign, state and local income taxes in some or all of the jurisdictions in which the Partnership conducts business or owns property, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. The ownership of Common Stock, as opposed to Units, would greatly simplify the U.S. federal and state income tax reporting requirements with respect to an investment in Hi-Crush in future years and might eliminate the requirement of multi-state income tax filings for certain Unitholders. 
Favorable Circumstances Exist for Conversion. The Partnership currently is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The GP Board believes that it is advantageous for the Partnership to convert to a corporation now because: (i) the Conversion can be effected in a nonrecognition transaction under current U.S. federal income tax law and (ii) the Conversion is facilitated by the Partnership's financial performance, improving equity market conditions generally and other factors set forth below.  On August 1, 2018, the Partnership completed the private placement of $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 9.50% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the "Senior Notes") and entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility"), which matures on August 1, 2023. Both the Senior Notes and the ABL Credit Facility contemplated the Conversion, and no amendments or consents for the Conversion are required from the bond holders or lenders.     
Accordingly, the GP Board believes that it is advantageous to convert to corporate form at the present time and that any potential benefit derived from maintaining the Partnership's current form is outweighed by the (i) long-term benefits to be derived from the Conversion and (ii) the risk that postponing such a conversion until a later date could result in the Partnership's inability to consummate such a transaction in an orderly manner under favorable circumstances. 
Enhances Hi-Crush's Ability to Attract and Retain Directors. The GP Board believes that conversion to corporate form will enhance Hi-Crush's ability to attract and retain directors. Many candidates for the board of directors are already familiar with Delaware corporate law, including provisions relating to director indemnification, from their past business experience. Not only is Delaware corporate law most familiar to directors, but Delaware corporate law also provides greater predictability and responsiveness to corporate needs and more certainty regarding indemnification and limitation of liability of directors, all of which could enable the directors to act in the best interests of the Corporation. As a result, the GP Board believes that Hi-Crush will be able to more effectively retain its current directors or attract and retain new directors. 
The DGCL Improves Predictability and Responsiveness. The DGCL is generally acknowledged to be the most advanced corporate law in the United States. The Delaware General Assembly annually considers and adopts statutory amendments that the Corporation Law Section of the Delaware State Bar Association proposes in an effort to ensure that the corporate law continues to be responsive to the changing needs of businesses. Delaware's well-established body of case law construing Delaware corporate law has evolved over the last century and provides businesses with greater predictability than the Delaware LP Act. The abundance of Delaware corporate case law serves to enhance the relative clarity and predictability of many areas of corporate law, which the GP Board believes will offer added advantages to the Corporation by allowing the New Board and management to make corporate decisions and take corporate actions with greater assurance as to the validity and consequences of those decisions and actions. 
Other Material Factors Considered 
The GP Board weighed the advantages and opportunities described above and elsewhere in this proxy statement against a number of other factors identified in its deliberations weighing negatively against the Conversion, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the possible disruption to the Partnership's business that may result from the Conversion and the resulting  distraction of the attention of the Partnership's management, as well as the costs and expenses associated with completing the Conversion;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the possibility that the Conversion might not be consummated despite the parties' efforts or that the  closing of the Conversion might be unduly delayed; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the risks of the type and nature described under "Risk Factors" and the matters described under  "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  
[END TABLE]
After consideration of these material factors, the GP Board determined that these risks could be mitigated or managed by the Partnership or, following the Conversion, by the Corporation, and were reasonably acceptable under the circumstances or, in light of the anticipated benefits overall, were significantly outweighed by the potential benefits of the Conversion. 
This discussion of the information and factors considered by the GP Board in making its decision is not intended to be exhaustive but rather reflects certain material factors considered by the GP Board. In view of the   wide variety of factors considered in connection with its respective evaluation of the Conversion and the complexity of these matters, the GP Board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to these factors. In addition, individual members of the GP Board may have given different weight to different factors. 
The GP Board realized that there can be no assurance about future results, including results considered or expected as described in the factors listed above. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the GP Board and all other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
The GP Board has unanimously recommended that the Unitholders vote FOR the Plan of Conversion Proposal. 
No Appraisal Rights 
The Unitholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Conversion. 
Antitrust and Regulatory Matters 
The Partnership has determined that the Conversion is not subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, and no other governmental consents are required. 
Listing of Hi-Crush Inc. Common Stock 
The Common Stock issuable in the Conversion is expected to be approved for listing and trade on the NYSE under the symbol "HCR." 
Deregistration and Delisting of the Units 
The Units are currently traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "HCLP." Upon consummation of the Conversion, the Units will cease to be listed on the NYSE and will be subsequently deregistered under the Exchange Act. The former Unitholders will become Stockholders of the Corporation and their rights as Stockholders will be governed by Delaware law and by the Charter and Bylaws that will be in effect upon consummation of the Conversion. The Partnership intends to cease filing periodic reports pursuant to the Exchange Act with the SEC following deregistration of its Units, pursuant to securities laws requirements, with the Corporation becoming the successor registrant. 
Continuing Board and Management Positions 
Upon completion of the Conversion, the current directors and executive officers of the Partnership are expected to continue in their current positions, other than as may be publicly announced by Hi-Crush in the normal course of business. 
Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance 
In connection with the Conversion, the Corporation will enter into indemnification agreements with all of its named executive officers and directors (collectively, "indemnitees"). These agreements will provide that the indemnitees will be protected as promised in the Bylaws (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of the Bylaws, any change in the composition of the New Board or any acquisition transaction relating to the Corporation) and advanced expenses to the fullest extent of the law and as set forth in the indemnification agreements. These agreements will also provide, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the   continued coverage of the indemnitees under the Corporation's director and officer insurance policies. The indemnification agreements, among other things and subject to certain limitations, will indemnify and hold harmless the indemnitees against any and all reasonable expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, and any and all liability and loss, including judgments, fines, ERISA, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, incurred or paid by the indemnitees in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether or not by or in the right of the corporation or otherwise, in which the indemnitees are, were or at any time become parties, or are threatened to be made parties or are involved by reason of the fact that the indemnitees are or were the Corporation's directors or officers or are or were serving at its request as directors, officers, employees, trustees or representatives of another corporation or enterprise. 
Treatment of the Partnership Equity Awards 
At the effective time of the Conversion, each outstanding phantom unit award under the HCLP LTIP will be converted into a restricted stock unit award of the Corporation, with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) applicable to such award immediately prior to the Conversion, representing the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Units subject to such award immediately prior to the Conversion. All distribution equivalent rights granted in tandem with a corresponding phantom unit award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Conversion will be converted into dividend equivalent rights, with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) applicable to such distribution equivalent rights immediately prior to the Conversion, representing the right to receive (i) any amounts accrued under the distribution equivalent right as of the Conversion and (ii) any dividends paid by the Corporation from and after the Conversion with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the restricted stock unit award to which such dividend equivalent right relates. 
Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Conversion 
None of the named executive officers or directors of the General Partner will be entitled to any payments in connection with the Conversion.

The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of (i) Units issued and outstanding as of February 14, 2019 and (ii) shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately following the Conversion, in each case for:

 COMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS 
The rights of the Unitholders are currently governed by the Partnership Agreement and the Delaware LP Act. After the Conversion, the Unitholders will become Stockholders, and their rights will be governed by the DGCL and the Charter and the Bylaws that will be in effect upon consummation of the Conversion. See "Description of Hi-Crush Inc. Capital Stock" for a summary of the terms of the Charter and Bylaws to be in effect upon consummation of the Conversion. 
Set forth below are material differences among the rights of a holder of Common Stock under the Charter, the Bylaws and the DGCL, on the one hand, and the rights of a holder of Units under the Partnership Agreement and the Delaware LP Act, on the other hand. The identification of specific differences is not intended to indicate that other equally significant or more significant differences do not exist. 
The following summary does not reflect any rules of the NYSE or any other national exchange that may apply to the Partnership or the Corporation in connection with the matters discussed. This summary does not purport to be a complete discussion of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Delaware LP Act, the DGCL, the Partnership Agreement, the Charter and the Bylaws.

There are limited exceptions under the DGCL providing that a merger may be effected without stockholder approval, including that  no vote of the stockholders of a constituent corporation is required where that constituent corporation is the surviving corporation and:     such corporations certificate of incorporation is not amended in the merger;     the stockholders of the  surviving corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger will hold the same number of shares, with identical designations, preferences, limitations and rights, immediately after the effective date of  the merger; and     either no  shares of common stock of the surviving corporation and no shares, securities or obligations convertible into such stock are to be issued or delivered under the plan of merger, or the authorized unissued shares or the treasury shares of common stock  of the surviving corporation to be issued or delivered under the plan of merger plus those initially issuable upon conversion of any other shares, securities or obligations to be issued or delivered under such plan do not exceed 20% of     A merger, consolidation or conversion of the Partnership requires the prior consent of the General Partner.

 The Corporation     The Partnership the shares of common stock of such corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger.   The DGCL contains a business combination statute that protects domestic corporations  subject to its provisions from hostile takeovers and from actions following such a takeover, by prohibiting some transactions once an acquirer has gained a significant holding in the corporation unless certain requirements are met. Section 203  of the DGCL generally prohibits "business combinations," including mergers, sales and leases of assets, issuances of securities and similar transactions by a corporation or a subsidiary with an interested stockholder who beneficially owns  15% or more of a corporation's voting stock, within three years after the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder, unless: (i) the board of directors of the target corporation has approved, before the acquisition date, either  the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the person owns at least 85%  of the corporation's voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors who are officers and shares owned by employee stock plans in which participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares will be tendered in a tender  or exchange offer); or (iii) after the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the vote of at least 66 2/3% of the  outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder. Section 203 of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to elect not to be governed by the provisions of Section 203.

Except as otherwise specified in Section 203, an "interested stockholder" is defined to include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, or is an  affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within three years immediately prior to the date of determination; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
• the affiliates and associates of any such person.  
[END TABLE]
Under some circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person that is an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations for a three-year period. Section 203 of the DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to elect not to be governed by the provisions of Section 203. The Corporation will not make such an election and therefore will be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. 
Transfer Agent and Registrar 
The transfer agent and registrar for the shares of Common Stock will be American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of (i) the Conversion to Unitholders that are U.S. holders (as defined below) and (ii) the ownership and disposition of Common Stock by such U.S. holders who receive Common Stock pursuant to the Conversion. This discussion is limited to U.S. holders who hold their Units, and, if applicable, will hold their Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion, as a "capital asset" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). No rulings have been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to any of the tax consequences discussed below. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. 
This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to Unitholders that are not U.S. holders. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Conversion and the ownership and disposition of any Common Stock received pursuant to the Conversion. 
This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address any tax consequences under any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to income taxes, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the Medicare tax on certain investment income or arising under the laws of any state, local, or foreign jurisdiction. Furthermore, this discussion does not apply to U.S. holders that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:

[END TABLE]
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Units or Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership, and upon certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holding Units should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Conversion and the ownership and disposition of Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion to them. 
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE CONVERSION AND THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF COMMON STOCK RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION. EACH HOLDER OF UNITS IS STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE SPECIFIC U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE CONVERSION AND THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF COMMON STOCK RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. 
Tax Consequences of the Conversion to U.S. Holders of Units 
In General 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Conversion should be treated as follows. The Partnership should be deemed to have transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the Corporation, which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to have received in exchange for such transfer all of the Common Stock of the Corporation, which the Corporation then distributes to the Unitholders in complete liquidation of the Partnership. 
If the Partnership's tax basis in the assets transferred to the Corporation exceeds the amount of the Partnership's liabilities assumed by the Corporation in the deemed transfer, no gain or loss should be recognized by the Partnership in connection with the Conversion. If the liabilities assumed exceed the tax basis of the Partnership's assets deemed transferred, the Partnership would recognize gain in the amount of such excess, which gain would be allocated to the Unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in the Partnership. If no gain or loss   is recognized in connection with the Conversion, the tax basis of the assets transferred to the Corporation will not increase or decrease in connection with the Conversion. If gain is recognized by the Partnership, the amount of such gain would increase the basis of the assets transferred to the Corporation. 
The foregoing description of the tax characterization of the Conversion is based on the assumption that the Unitholders will own, in the aggregate, at least 80% of the Corporation's Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Conversion, excluding from the numerator any Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion that is sold after the Conversion pursuant to a plan or arrangement established before the Conversion (the "Control Assumption"). The Control Assumption should be correct unless, contrary to the knowledge of the Partnership, a group of Unitholders holding more than 20% of the Partnership's Units agree prior to the Conversion to sell the Common Stock they receive in connection with the Conversion. If the Control Assumption is not correct, the Conversion should be treated as if the Partnership (i) sold all of its assets to the Corporation for an amount equal to the value of the Common Stock received by the Partnership in the Conversion plus the amount of the Partnership's liabilities assumed by the Corporation in the Conversion and (ii) distributed the Common Stock received in the Conversion to the Unitholders in complete liquidation of their interests in the Partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership would recognize gain (or loss) on the Conversion in an amount equal to the amount by which the value of the Common Stock received plus the amount of the Partnership's liabilities assumed exceeds (or is less than) the tax basis of the assets transferred by the Partnership. Any such gain or loss would be allocated to the Unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in the Partnership. 
If the Control Assumption is not correct, the Corporation's tax basis in the assets transferred by the Partnership would equal the value of the Common Stock deemed issued in connection with the Conversion plus the amount of the Partnership's liabilities assumed, and the Corporation's holding period in the assets would begin the day after the Conversion. 
If the Control Assumption is correct and provided that the Partnership recognizes no gain or loss in connection with the Conversion, a Unitholder should not be allocated any gain or loss except to the extent that the Partnership's liabilities allocated to such Unitholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to the Conversion and assumed by the Corporation exceed such Unitholder's tax basis in its Units. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a Unitholder's relief from such share of the Partnership's liabilities is treated as if such Unitholder received a cash distribution from the Partnership in the amount of the liabilities deemed assumed by the Corporation. Based on the purchase prices of the Units and the prior allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction by the Partnership to the Unitholders, it is not expected that the amount of the liabilities allocated to any Unitholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes will exceed any Unitholder's tax basis in its Units at the time of the Conversion. 
Tax Basis and Holding Period in the Common Stock Received in Connection with the Conversion 
The aggregate basis of the Common Stock received by a Unitholder in exchange for Units upon the deemed liquidation of the Partnership should equal the aggregate basis in the Units held by such Unitholder immediately before the Conversion (reduced by the amount of liabilities deemed assumed by the Corporation in connection with the Conversion) and increased by the gain, if any, that the Partnership recognizes in connection with the Conversion. 
Unitholders will have a split holding period in the Common Stock received. The Common Stock received by a Unitholder in exchange for Units upon the deemed liquidation of the Partnership should have a holding period that begins on the day following the Conversion to the extent that the value of Common Stock received is attributable to certain of the Partnership's assets deemed contributed to the Corporation (generally, the Partnership's assets that would generate ordinary income or loss when sold), and to the extent of the balance, will generally have a holding period that includes the period the assets were held by the Partnership prior to their deemed contribution to the Corporation.  Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Owning and Disposing of Common Stock Received in Connection with the Conversion 
Distributions on the Common Stock 
Distributions with respect to the Common Stock will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from the Corporation's current or accumulated "earnings and profits" as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds the Corporation's current and accumulated earnings and profits, such distribution will first be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of (and reducing, but not below zero) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock and thereafter be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such Common Stock. 
Non-corporate U.S. holders that receive distributions on the Common Stock that are treated dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the reduced long-term capital gains rate, provided certain holding period requirements are met. 
If a distribution or portion of a distribution on the Common Stock fails to qualify as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, corporate U.S. holders will be unable to utilize the corporate dividends-received deduction with respect to such distribution or portion thereof. 
Gain or Loss on Disposition of the Common Stock 
A U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on a sale, exchange, certain redemption, or other taxable disposition of Common Stock in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition of such Common Stock and (ii) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such Common Stock. A U.S. holder's tax basis in its Common Stock generally will be equal to the amount paid for such stock reduced (but not below zero) by distributions received on such stock that are not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for the Common Stock sold or disposed of is more than one year at the time of such taxable disposition. Long-term capital gains of individuals are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
Information returns may be required to be filed with the IRS in connection with distributions made on, or proceeds from the disposition of, Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion. A U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. backup withholding on distributions made on, or proceeds from the disposition of, Common Stock received in connection with the Conversion, unless such holder provides the applicable withholding agent with proof of its exemption from backup withholding or furnishes the applicable withholding agent with its taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of perjury, and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against a U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS.  HI-CRUSH INC. LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
At the special meeting, the Unitholders will be asked to approve the Hi-Crush Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"), which reserves 8,731,053 shares of Common Stock for delivery thereunder. If approved, the LTIP will be effective as of the date of the Conversion. 
On January 29, 2019, subject to the approval of the Unitholders and the Conversion, the GP Board adopted the LTIP. The proposed LTIP is attached hereto as Annex C. If the Unitholders approve this proposal, we intend to file, pursuant to the Securities Act, a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the shares available for delivery under the LTIP. 
Upon the effectiveness of the LTIP, the Hi-Crush Partners, LP First Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan will be terminated and no further awards will be granted thereunder. As of December 31, 2018 there were 2,390,138 Units subject to outstanding awards under the HCLP LTIP, with 840,915 additional Units remaining available for issuance under the HCLP LTIP. 
Background and Purpose of the Proposal 
The LTIP is a broad-based plan under which we may grant awards to all employees, including officers and officers of the Corporation's subsidiaries and affiliates, non-employee members of the New Board and other service providers. The GP Board believes that approval of the LTIP will give the Corporation the flexibility to make stock-based grants and other awards permitted under the LTIP over the next four years in amounts determined appropriate by the New Board; however, this timeline is simply an estimate used to determine the number of shares of Common Stock requested under the LTIP and future circumstances may require a change to expected equity grant practices. These circumstances include but are not limited to the future price of the Common Stock, award levels and hiring activity over the next few years. 
If the LTIP is approved, the potential dilution from issuances authorized under the LTIP will be approximately 8.6%. Please see "Summary of the LTIP" for additional information regarding the number of shares reserved for issuance under the LTIP. While the GP Board is aware of the potential dilutive effect of compensatory equity awards, the GP Board also recognizes the significant retention, motivational and performance benefits that may be achieved from making such awards. 
The ability to grant equity-based compensation awards is critical to attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals. The GP Board believes that it is in the best interest of the Unitholders for those individuals to have an ownership interest in the Corporation in recognition of their present and potential contributions and to align their interests with those of the future Stockholders. Further details about awards currently outstanding at the Partnership can be found in the sections titled "—Securities to be Offered" below and the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Summary of the LTIP 
The following summary provides a general description of the material features of the LTIP but is not a complete description of all provisions of the LTIP and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the LTIP attached as Annex C, which is incorporated by reference in this proposal. The purpose of the LTIP is to attract, retain and motivate qualified persons as employees, directors and other service providers of the Corporation and its affiliates. The LTIP also provides a means through which such persons can acquire and maintain stock ownership or awards, the value of which is tied to the performance of the Corporation, thereby strengthening their concern for the Corporation and its affiliates. 
The LTIP provides for potential grants of: (i) incentive stock options qualified as such under U.S. federal income tax laws ("ISOs"); (ii) stock options that do not qualify as incentive stock options ("Nonstatutory   Options," and together with ISOs, "Options"); (iii) stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); (iv) restricted stock awards ("Restricted Stock Awards"); (v) restricted stock units ("Restricted Stock Units" or "RSUs"); (vi) vested stock awards ("Stock Awards"); (vii) dividend equivalents; (viii) other stock- or cash-based awards; (ix) cash awards; and (x) substitute awards (referred to collectively with the other awards as the "Awards"). 
Key features of the LTIP include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No automatic Award grants are promised to any eligible individual;

• No repricing, replacement or re-granting of Options, SARs or other stock  awards without Stockholder approval if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price of the Award;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares withheld or surrendered in payment of any exercise or purchase price of an Award or taxes relating to an  Award will not be available for new Awards;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meaningful limits on total director compensation. 
[END TABLE]
Eligibility to Participate 
Employees, non-employee directors and other service providers of the Corporation and its affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the LTIP. Eligible individuals to whom an Award is granted under the LTIP are referred to as "Participants." The Corporation and its affiliates currently have approximately four executive officers, 716 other employees, three non-employee directors and no other service providers who will be eligible to participate in the LTIP. 
Securities to be Offered 
Subject to adjustment in the event of any distribution, recapitalization, stock split, merger, consolidation or other corporate event, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Awards under the LTIP is equal to 8,731,053 shares of Common Stock (the "Share Pool"), and all of such shares will be available for issuance upon the exercise of ISOs. Subject to the share counting provisions, the Share Pool will be reduced by the number of shares of Common Stock that will be subject to substitute awards issued in conversion of outstanding awards under the HCLP LTIP. 
If an Award under the LTIP is forfeited, settled for cash or expires without the actual delivery of shares, any shares subject to such Award will again be available for new Awards under the LTIP. Any shares withheld or surrendered in payment of any exercise or purchase price of an Award or taxes relating to Awards will not be available for new Awards under the LTIP. 
Director Compensation Limits 
Under the LTIP, in a single calendar year, a non-employee director may not be paid compensation, whether denominated in cash or Awards, for such individual's service on the New Board in excess of $500,000, pro-rated for partial calendar years of service. Additional cash amounts or Awards may be paid for any calendar year in which a non-employee director (i) first becomes a member of the New Board, (ii) serves on a special committee of the New Board, or (iii) serves as lead director.  Administration 
The New Board (or a committee or two or more directors appointed by the New Board) will administer the LTIP (as applicable, the "Administrator"). Subject to the terms of the LTIP and applicable law, the Administrator has broad authority to select Participants to receive awards, determine the types of awards and terms and conditions of awards and interpret provisions of the LTIP. Subject to applicable law, the Administrator is also authorized to interpret the LTIP, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the LTIP, to delegate duties under the LTIP, to terminate, modify or amend the LTIP (except for certain amendments that require Stockholder approval as described below), and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the LTIP. The Administrator may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the LTIP in the manner and to the extent the Administrator deems necessary or desirable. 
Source of Shares 
Common Stock issued under the LTIP may come from (i) authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, (ii) treasury stock held by the Corporation or (iii)  previously issued shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Corporation, including shares purchased on the open market. 
Awards Under  the LTIP 
Options. An Option represents a right to purchase Common Stock at a fixed exercise price. The Corporation may grant Options to eligible persons including: (i) ISOs (only to employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries) which comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code; and (ii) Nonstatutory Options. The exercise price of each Option granted under the LTIP will be stated in the option agreement and may vary; however, except in limited circumstances, the exercise price for an Option must not be less than the fair market value per share of Common Stock as of the date of grant (or 110% of the fair market value for certain ISOs), nor may the Option be re-priced without the prior approval of the Stockholders. Options may be exercised as the Administrator determines, but not later than 10 years from the date of grant. The Administrator determines the methods and form of payment for the exercise price of an Option (including, in the discretion of the Administrator, payment in Common Stock, other Awards or other property) and the methods and forms in which Common Stock will be delivered to a Participant. 
SARs. A SAR is the right to receive an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR, payable in either cash or shares of Common Stock or any combination thereof as determined by the Administrator. The grant price of a share of Common Stock subject to the SAR will be determined by the Administrator, but, except in limited circumstances, in no event will that grant price be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The Administrator has the discretion to determine the other terms and conditions of a SAR award. 
Restricted Stock Awards. A Restricted Stock Award is a grant of shares of Common Stock subject to a risk of forfeiture, performance conditions, restrictions on transferability and any other restrictions imposed by the Administrator in its discretion. Restrictions may lapse at such times and under such circumstances as determined by the Administrator. Except as otherwise provided under the terms of an Award agreement, the holder of a Restricted Stock Award will generally have rights as a Stockholder, including the right to vote the Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award and to receive dividends on the Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award during the restriction period. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator and specified in the Award agreement, Common Stock distributed in connection with a stock split or stock dividend, and other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend, will be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock Award with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed. 
Restricted Stock Units. RSUs are rights to receive Common Stock, cash, or a combination of both equal in value to the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the RSUs at the end of a specified period or upon   the occurrence of a specified event. The Administrator will subject RSUs to restrictions to be specified in the RSU Award agreement, and those restrictions may lapse at such times determined by the Administrator. 
Stock Awards. The Administrator is authorized to grant vested Common Stock as a Stock Award. The Administrator will determine any terms and conditions applicable to grants of Common Stock, including performance criteria, if any, associated with a Stock Award. 
Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents entitle a Participant to receive cash, shares of Common Stock, other Awards, or other property equal in value to dividends or other distributions paid with respect to a specified number of shares of Common Stock. Dividend equivalents may be awarded on a free-standing basis or in connection with another Award (other than a Restricted Stock Award or Stock Award). The terms and conditions applicable to dividend equivalents will be determined by the Administrator and set forth in an Award agreement. 
Other Stock-Based or Cash-Based Awards. Other stock-based Awards are awards denominated in or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, the value of Common Stock. Cash-based awards may be granted on a free-standing basis, as an element of or a supplement to, or in lieu of any other Award. 
Substitute Awards. The Corporation may grant Awards in substitution for any other Award granted under the LTIP or another plan of the Corporation or its predecessors or affiliates or any other right of a person to receive payment from the Corporation or its affiliates. Awards may also be granted in substitution for awards held by individuals who become eligible individuals as a result of certain business transactions, in which case, subject to applicable stock exchange requirements, shares of Common Stock subject to such Awards will not be added to or subtracted from the Share Pool. Substitute awards that are Options or SARs may have an exercise price per share that is less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of substitution if the substitution complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and regulations promulgated thereunder and other applicable laws. 
Other Provisions 
Recapitalization. In the event of any "equity restructuring" event (such as a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar event) with respect to Common Stock, the Administrator will equitably adjust (i) the aggregate number or kind of shares that may be delivered under the LTIP, (ii) the number or kind of shares or amount of cash subject to an Award, (iii) the terms and conditions of Awards, including the purchase price or exercise price of Awards and performance goals, and (iv) the applicable share-based limitations with respect to Awards provided in the LTIP, in each case to equitably reflect such event. 
Change in Control. Except to the extent otherwise provided in any applicable Award agreement, no Award will vest solely upon the occurrence of a change in control. In the event of a change in control or other relevant changes to the Corporation or the Common Stock, the Administrator may, in its discretion, (i) accelerate the time of exercisability of an Award, (ii) require Awards to be surrendered in exchange for a cash payment (including canceling an Option or SAR for no consideration if it has an exercise price or the grant price less than or equal to the value paid in the transaction), or (iii) make any other adjustments to Awards that the Administrator deems appropriate to reflect such change in control or other event. 
Tax Withholding. The Corporation and any of its affiliates have the right to withhold, or require payment of, the amount of any applicable taxes due or potentially payable upon exercise, award or lapse of restrictions. The Administrator will determine, in its sole discretion, the form of payment acceptable for such tax withholding obligations, including the delivery of cash or cash equivalents, Common Stock (including previously owned shares, net settlement, a broker-assisted sale, or other cashless withholding or reduction of the amount of shares otherwise issuable or delivered pursuant to the Award), other property, or any other legal consideration the Administrator deems appropriate.  Limitations on Transfer of Awards. Participants may not assign, alienate, pledge, attach, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber any Award, other than a Stock Award. Options and SARs may only be exercised by a Participant during that Participant's lifetime or by the person to whom the Participant's rights pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, notwithstanding these restrictions, a Participant may assign or transfer, without consideration, an Award, other than an ISO, with the consent of the Administrator and subject to various conditions stated in the LTIP. All shares of Common Stock subject to an Award and evidenced by a stock certificate will contain a legend restricting the transferability of the shares pursuant to the terms of the LTIP, which can be removed once the restrictions have terminated, lapsed or been satisfied. If shares are issued in book entry form, a notation to the same restrictive effect will be placed on the transfer agent's books in connection with such shares. 
Clawback. All Awards under the LTIP will be subject to any clawback policy adopted by the Corporation, as in effect from time to time. 
Plan Amendment and Termination. The Administrator may amend or terminate any Award or Award agreement or amend the LTIP at any time and the New Board may amend or terminate the LTIP at any time; however, Stockholder approval will be required for any amendment to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law or exchange listing standards. The Administrator does not have the authority, without the approval of Stockholders to amend any outstanding Option or SAR to reduce its exercise price per share or take any other action that would be considered a repricing under the applicable exchange listing standards. Without the consent of an affected Participant, no action by the Administrator or the New Board to amend or terminate any Award, Award agreement or the LTIP, as applicable, may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award. 
Term of the LTIP. If the Unitholders approve the LTIP Proposal, the LTIP will become effective upon the Conversion. Unless earlier terminated by action of the New Board, the LTIP will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Conversion. Awards granted before the termination date of the LTIP will continue to be effective according to their terms and conditions. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following discussion is for general information only and is intended to briefly summarize the United States federal income tax consequences to Participants arising from participation in the LTIP. This description is based on current law, which is subject to change (possibly retroactively). The tax treatment of a Participant in the LTIP may vary depending on his or her particular situation and may, therefore, be subject to special rules not discussed below. No attempt has been made to discuss any potential foreign, state, or local tax consequences. In addition, Nonstatutory Options and SARs with an exercise price less than the fair market value of shares of the Common Stock on the date of grant, SARs payable in cash, RSUs, and certain other Awards that may be granted pursuant to the LTIP, could be subject to additional taxes unless they are designed to comply with certain restrictions set forth in Section 409A of the Code and guidance promulgated thereunder. 
Tax Consequences to Participants under the LTIP 
Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. Participants will not realize taxable income upon the grant of an Option or SAR. Upon the exercise of a Nonstatutory Option or an SAR, a Participant will recognize ordinary compensation income (subject to the Corporation's withholding obligations if an employee) in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount of cash and the fair market value of the common stock received, over (ii) the exercise price of the Award. A Participant will generally have a tax basis in any shares of Common Stock received pursuant to the exercise of a Nonstatutory Option or SAR that equals the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise. Subject to the discussion under "Tax Consequences to the Corporation" below, the Corporation will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes that corresponds as to timing and amount with the compensation income recognized by a Participant under the foregoing rules. When a Participant   sells the Common Stock acquired as a result of the exercise of a Nonstatutory Option or SAR, any appreciation (or depreciation) in the value of the Common Stock after the exercise date is treated as long- or short-term capital gain (or loss) for federal income tax purposes, depending on the holding period. The Common Stock must be held for more than 12 months to qualify for long-term capital gain treatment. 
Participants eligible to receive an ISO will not recognize taxable income on the grant of an ISO. Upon the exercise of an ISO, a Participant will not recognize taxable income, although the excess of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock received upon exercise of the ISO ("ISO Stock") over the exercise price will increase the alternative minimum taxable income of the Participant, which may cause such Participant to incur alternative minimum tax. The payment of any alternative minimum tax attributable to the exercise of an ISO would be allowed as a credit against the Participant's regular tax liability in a later year to the extent the Participant's regular tax liability is in excess of the alternative minimum tax for that year. 
Upon the disposition of ISO Stock that has been held for the required holding period (generally, at least two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise of the ISO), a Participant will generally recognize capital gain (or loss) equal to the excess (or shortfall) of the amount received in the disposition over the exercise price paid by the Participant for the ISO Stock. However, if a Participant disposes of ISO Stock that has not been held for the requisite holding period (a "Disqualifying Disposition"), the Participant will recognize ordinary compensation income in the year of the Disqualifying Disposition in an amount equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the ISO Stock at the time of exercise of the ISO (or, if less, the amount realized in the case of an arm's length disposition to an unrelated party) exceeds the exercise price paid by the Participant for such ISO Stock. A Participant would also recognize capital gain to the extent the amount realized in the Disqualifying Disposition exceeds the fair market value of the ISO Stock on the exercise date. If the exercise price paid for the ISO Stock exceeds the amount realized (in the case of an arm's-length disposition to an unrelated party), such excess would ordinarily constitute a capital loss. 
The Corporation will generally not be entitled to any federal income tax deduction upon the grant or exercise of an ISO, unless a Participant makes a Disqualifying Disposition of the ISO Stock. If a Participant makes a Disqualifying Disposition, the Corporation will then, subject to the discussion below under "Tax Consequences to the Corporation," be entitled to a tax deduction that corresponds as to timing and amount with the compensation income recognized by a Participant under the rules described in the preceding paragraph. 
Under current rulings, if a Participant transfers previously held shares of Common Stock (other than ISO Stock that has not been held for the requisite holding period) in satisfaction of part or all of the exercise price of an Option, whether a Nonstatutory Option or an ISO, no additional gain will be recognized on the transfer of such previously held shares in satisfaction of the Nonstatutory Option or ISO exercise price (although a Participant would still recognize ordinary compensation income upon exercise of a Nonstatutory Option in the manner described above). Moreover, that number of shares of Common Stock received upon exercise which equals the number of shares of previously held Common Stock surrendered in satisfaction of the Nonstatutory Option or ISO exercise price will have a tax basis that equals, and a capital gains holding period that includes, the tax basis and capital gains holding period of the previously held shares of Common Stock surrendered in satisfaction of the Nonstatutory Option or ISO exercise price. Any additional shares of Common Stock received upon exercise will have a tax basis that equals the amount of cash (if any) paid by the Participant, plus the amount of compensation income recognized by the Participant under the rules described above. 
The LTIP generally prohibits the transfer of Awards other than by will or according to the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order, but the LTIP allows the Administrator to permit the transfer of Awards (other than ISOs) in limited circumstances, in its discretion. For income and gift tax purposes, certain transfers of Nonstatutory Options should generally be treated as completed gifts, subject to gift taxation. 
Internal Revenue Service has not provided formal guidance on the income tax consequences of a transfer of Nonstatutory Options (other than in the context of divorce) or SARs. However, the Internal Revenue   Service has informally indicated that after a transfer of stock options (other than in the context of divorce pursuant to a domestic relations order), the transferor will recognize income, which will be subject to withholding, and employment or payroll taxes will be collectible at the time the transferee exercises the stock options. If a Nonstatutory Option is transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order, the transferee will recognize ordinary income upon exercise by the transferee, which will be subject to withholding, and employment or payroll taxes (attributable to and reported with respect to the transferor) will be collectible from the transferee at such time. 
In addition, if a Participant transfers a vested Nonstatutory Option to another person and retains no interest in or power over it, the transfer is treated as a completed gift. The amount of the transferor's gift (or generation-skipping transfer, if the gift is to a grandchild or later generation) equals the value of the Nonstatutory Option at the time of the gift. The value of the Nonstatutory Option may be affected by several factors, including the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock, the potential for future appreciation or depreciation of the stock, the time period of the Nonstatutory Option and the illiquidity of the Nonstatutory Option. The transferor will be subject to a federal gift tax, which will be limited by (i) the annual exclusion of $15,000 per donee (for 2019, subject to adjustment in future years), (ii) the transferor's lifetime unified credit, or (iii) the marital or charitable deductions. The gifted Nonstatutory Option will not be included in the Participant's gross estate for purposes of the federal estate tax or the generation-skipping transfer tax. 
This favorable tax treatment for vested Nonstatutory Options has not been extended to unvested Nonstatutory Options. Whether such consequences apply to unvested Nonstatutory Options or to SARs is uncertain and the gift tax implications of such a transfer is a risk the transferor will bear upon such a disposition. 
Restricted Stock Awards; RSUs; Stock Awards; Other Stock-Based or Cash-Based Awards. A Participant will recognize ordinary compensation income upon receipt of cash pursuant to a cash award or, if earlier, at the time the cash is otherwise made available for the Participant to draw upon. Individuals will not have taxable income at the time of grant of an RSU, but rather, will generally recognize ordinary compensation income at the time he or she receives cash or a share of Common Stock in settlement of the RSU, as applicable, in an amount equal to the cash or the fair market value of the Common Stock received. 
A recipient of a Restricted Stock Award or Stock Award generally will be subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates on the fair market value of the Common Stock when it is received, reduced by any amount paid by the recipient; however, if the Common Stock is not transferable and is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture when received, a Participant will recognize ordinary compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock (i) when the Common Stock first becomes transferable and is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, in cases where a Participant does not make a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code, or (ii) when the Award is received, in cases where a Participant makes a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code. If a Section 83(b) election is made and the shares are subsequently forfeited, the recipient will not be allowed to take a deduction for the value of the forfeited shares. If a Section 83(b) election has not been made, any dividends received with respect to a Restricted Stock Award that is subject at that time to a risk of forfeiture or restrictions on transfer generally will be treated as compensation that is taxable as ordinary income to the recipient; otherwise the dividends will be treated as dividends. 
A Participant who is an employee will be subject to withholding for federal, and generally for state and local, income taxes at the time he or she recognizes income under the rules described above. The tax basis in the Common Stock received by a Participant will equal the amount recognized by the Participant as compensation income under the rules described in the preceding paragraph, and the Participant's capital gains holding period in those shares will commence on the later of the date the shares are received or the restrictions lapse. Subject to the discussion below under "Tax Consequences to the Corporation," the Corporation will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes that corresponds as to timing and amount with the compensation income recognized by a Participant under the foregoing rules.  Tax Consequences to the Corporation 
Reasonable Compensation. In order for the amounts described above to be deductible by the Corporation (or its subsidiary), such amounts must constitute reasonable compensation for services rendered or to be rendered and must be ordinary and necessary business expenses. 
Golden Parachute Payments. Our ability (or the ability of one of our subsidiaries) to obtain a deduction for future payments under the LTIP could also be limited by the golden parachute rules of Section 280G of the Code, which prevent the deductibility of certain excess parachute payments made in connection with a change in control of an employer-corporation. 
Compensation of Covered Employees. The ability of the Corporation (or its subsidiary) to obtain a deduction for amounts paid under the LTIP could be limited by Section 162(m) of the Code. Section 162(m) of the Code limits the Corporation's ability to deduct compensation, for federal income tax purposes, paid during any year to a "covered employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code) in excess of $1,000,000. 
New Plan Benefits 
The future awards, if any, that will be made to eligible persons under the LTIP are subject to the discretion of the Administrator, and therefore, the benefits or number of shares subject to awards that may be granted in the future to our executive officers, employees and directors is not currently determinable. Therefore, a New Plan Benefit Table is not provided. If the Unitholders approve the LTIP Proposal, all outstanding awards under the HCLP LTIP will be converted into awards outstanding under the LTIP upon the Conversion reflecting an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, as reflected below under "Previously Awarded Rights". Additionally, all outstanding awards under the HCLP LTIP will be converted into awards with respect to shares of Common Stock in accordance with the recapitalization provisions of the HCLP LTIP, even if the LTIP Proposal is not approved by the Unitholders. 
Previously Awarded Rights 
The following table sets forth, for the named executive officers and certain other groups as of December 31, 2018, all Units underlying outstanding phantom unit awards under the HCLP LTIP. If the Unitholders approve the LTIP Proposal, all outstanding awards under the HCLP LTIP will be converted into awards outstanding under the LTIP upon the Conversion reflecting an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. No affiliate of any of the directors or named executive officers set forth below holds or has held (a) options to purchase Units or (b) rights to receive Units in the form of phantom unit awards.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans 
Upon Stockholder Approval of the LTIP and subject to the closing of the transactions, the HCLP LTIP will be terminated and no further awards will be granted thereunder. As required by applicable SEC rules, the following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2018 with respect to compensation plans under which the Partnership's equity securities are authorized for issuance.

(1)  The Partnership's Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted by the General Partner in August 2012 in connection  with the Partnership's IPO and contemplated the issuance or delivery of up to 1,364,035 Units to satisfy awards under the plan. The previous Long-Term Incentive Plan was superseded by the HCLP LTIP, which was approved by our common unitholders,  which, among other things, provided for an increase in the number of Units reserved and available for delivery with respect to awards under the HCLP LTIP by 2,700,000 Units to an aggregate of 4,064,035 Units, effective as of September 21, 2016.   
(2)  Represents phantom units subject to TPUs and PPUs granted under the HCLP LTIP, assuming the target distribution  at the time of vesting. Payment with respect to the outstanding PPUs range from 0% to 200% of the target distribution depending on performance actually attained, with a maximum number of 1,495,840 Units being potentially issuable under the HCLP  LTIP. There is no exercise price applicable to these awards.  
(3)  Includes Units that may be issued in payment of the outstanding PPUs awards reported in column (a) if and  to the extent such payment exceeds the target distribution amount reported in column (a)   with respect to such awards.  
[END TABLE]
Consequences of Failing to Approve the Proposal 
The LTIP will not be implemented unless approved by the Unitholders. If the LTIP is not approved by the Unitholders, the HCLP LTIP will remain in effect in its current form, but will be deemed to reflect shares of Common Stock in accordance with the recapitalization provisions set forth therein, and Hi-Crush Inc. will continue to grant awards under the HCLP LTIP until the share reserve under the HCLP LTIP is exhausted. The share reserve could last for a longer period of time, depending on our future equity grant practices, which Hi-Crush Inc. cannot predict with certainty. However, no awards can be made under the HCLP LTIP after September 21, 2026. If the remaining share reserve is exhausted, Hi-Crush Inc. may elect to provide   compensation through other means, such as cash-settled awards or other cash compensation, to assure that Hi-Crush Inc. and its affiliates can attract and retain qualified personnel. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by Unitholders represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting is required to approve the LTIP Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" the LTIP Proposal. Broker non-votes (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the LTIP Proposal. A properly executed proxy submitted without voting instructions will be voted (except to the extent that the authority to vote has been withheld) "FOR" approval of the LTIP Proposal. 
The GP Board recommends that the Unitholders vote FOR the LTIP Proposal.  UNITHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Ownership of Units does not entitle the Unitholders to make proposals at the special meeting.  HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY STATEMENT 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more unitholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those unitholders. As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to Unitholders residing at the same address, unless the Unitholders have notified the Partnership of their desire to receive multiple copies of this proxy statement. This process, which is commonly referred to in this proxy statement as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for unitholders and cost savings for companies. 
If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate copy of this proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please follow these instructions:

PLAN OF CONVERSION 
This PLAN OF CONVERSION (this "Plan of Conversion") sets forth certain terms of the conversion of Hi-Crush Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), to a Delaware corporation to be named "Hi-Crush Inc." (the "Corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the "Partnership Act") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). 
W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Plan of Conversion and in accordance with the Partnership Act and the DGCL, the Partnership will be converted to a Delaware corporation pursuant to and in accordance with Section 17-219 of the Partnership Act and Section 265 of the DGCL (the "Conversion"); 
WHEREAS, in connection with the Conversion, all of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (each, a "Common Unit," and, collectively, the "Common Units") will be converted into the right to receive shares of common stock or preferred stock of the Corporation and (ii) all of the outstanding general partner interests in the Partnership (the "GP Interests") will be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, as provided in this Plan of Conversion; and 
WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Plan of Conversion shall have the meanings given to them in the Partnership Agreement. 
NOW, THEREFORE, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Plan of Conversion and in accordance with the Partnership Act and the DGCL, upon the filing and effectiveness of the Certificate of Conversion and the Certificate of Incorporation (each as defined below), the Partnership shall be converted to the Corporation. 
ARTICLE I 
THE CONVERSION 
SECTION 1.01    The Conversion. At the Effective Time (as defined below), the Partnership shall be converted to the Corporation and, for all purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware and otherwise, the Conversion shall be deemed a continuation of the existence of the Partnership in the form of a Delaware corporation. The Conversion shall not require the Partnership to wind up its affairs under Section 17-803 of the Partnership Act or to pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under Section 17-804 of the Partnership Act, and the Conversion shall not constitute a dissolution of the Partnership. At the Effective Time, for all purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware and otherwise, all of the rights, privileges and powers of the Partnership, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to the Partnership, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to the Partnership, shall remain vested in the Corporation and shall be the property of the Corporation, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in the Partnership shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of any provision of the Partnership Act, the DGCL or otherwise; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of the Partnership shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Partnership shall remain attached to the Corporation, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it in its 
A-1 
 capacity as a corporation.

The Conversion shall become effective at 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on                 , 2019 (such time of effectiveness, the "Effective Time"). 
SECTION 1.03    Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation. At and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, until amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL.

CONVERSION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; REGISTRATION OF SHARES; GLOBAL STOCK CERTIFICATES 
SECTION 2.01    Conversion of Partnership Interests. At the Effective Time, (i) each Common Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Corporation ("CommonStock"), (ii) all of the General Partner Interests outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof, in each case without any action required on the part of the Partnership, the Corporation, the former holders the Common Units or the General Partner, as applicable. 
SECTION 2.02    Registration in Book-Entry. Shares of Common Stock shall not be represented by certificates but shall instead be uncertificated shares, unless the Board shall provide by resolution or resolutions otherwise. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Corporation shall register, or cause to be registered, in book-entry form, the shares of Common Stock into which the outstanding Common Units shall have been converted as a result of the Conversion.

(b)    There shall be no limitation or restriction on any variation between any of the different series of Preferred Stock as to the designations, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof; and the several series of Preferred Stock may, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), vary in any and all respects as fixed and determined by the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, providing for the issuance of the various series; provided, however, that all shares of any one series of Preferred Stock shall have the same designations, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions. 
Section 4.4    No Class Vote on Changes in Authorized Number of Shares of Stock. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL. 
ARTICLE V 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Section 5.1    Number. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the Board of Directors shall consist of one or more directors, the exact number to be determined from time to time solely by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then authorized. 
Section 5.2    Classification. 
(a)    Beginning on the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation, until the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, pursuant to Section 141(d) of the DGCL, the Board of Directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof (including any Preferred Stock Designation)) (the "Preferred Stock Directors")) shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The initial term of Class I directors (prior to the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, the "Class I Directors") shall expire at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders; the initial term of Class II directors (prior to the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, the "Class II Directors") shall expire at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders; and the initial term of Class III directors (prior to the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, the "Class III Directors") shall expire at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. Directors of each such class shall be elected to hold office for a three-year term and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office or until their 
A-8 
 earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. In case of any increase or decrease, from time to time, in the number of directors (other than Preferred Stock Directors), the number of directors in each class shall be apportioned as nearly equal as possible. The Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III, with such assignment becoming effective as of the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation. Prior to the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors who fill newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal from office or other cause to Class I, Class II, or Class III, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate and necessary. 
(b)    Commencing with the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, pursuant to Section 141(d) of the DGCL, the Board of Directors (other any Preferred Stock Directors) shall be divided into two classes, with the initial term of office of the first class to expire at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (following the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, but prior to the election of directors at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the "Class I Directors") and the initial term of office of the second class to expire at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders (following the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, but prior to the election of directors at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the "Class II Directors"). The directors elected at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, with each director to hold office for a two-year term and until the election and qualification of his or her respective successor in office or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. The successor of the directors who, immediately prior to the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, were Class I Directors (and whose terms expired at the 2023 annual meeting) shall be elected to Class I; the directors who, immediately prior to the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, were Class II Directors (and whose terms expire at the 2024 annual meeting) shall become Class I Directors following the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders; and the directors who, immediately prior to the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders were Class III Directors (and whose terms expire at the 2025 annual meeting) shall become Class II Directors following the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Following the election of directors at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders and prior to the election of directors at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors who fill newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal from office or other cause to Class I or Class II, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate and necessary. 
(c)    Commencing with the election of directors at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Classified Board Expiration Date"), pursuant to Section 141(d) of the DGCL, there shall be a single class of directors. The directors elected at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders shall be elected for a one-year term of office to expire at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, retirement, resignation, disqualification or removal. 
(d)    Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, and unless otherwise required by law or resolution of the Board of Directors, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors and any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office and entitled to vote thereon, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by the sole remaining director. Any director so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 
(e)    Except for such additional directors, if any, as are elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof (including any Preferred Stock 
A-9 
 Designation), prior to the Classified Board Expiration Date any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but only for "cause" and only by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. Upon the Classified Board Expiration Date and thereafter, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon. 
(f)    During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have the right to elect additional directors as provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and upon commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such number of directors that the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have a right to elect, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions; and (ii) each Preferred Stock Director shall serve until such Preferred Stock Director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to said provisions, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. 
Section 5.3    Powers. Except as otherwise required by the DGCL or as provided in this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law, the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or these Bylaws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. 
Section 5.4    Election; Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
(a)    Ballot Not Required. The directors of the Corporation need not be stockholders of the Corporation (unless otherwise so required by this Certificate of Incorporation, including any Preferred Stock Designation) and need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation so provide. 
(b)    Notice. Advance notice of nominations for the election of directors, and of business other than nominations, to be proposed by stockholders for consideration at a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner and to the extent provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. 
(c)    Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix. 
ARTICLE VI

AMENDMENT 
Section 9.1    Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 9.2    Amendment of Bylaws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation (including the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation that require an additional vote) or the Bylaws of the Corporation, and in addition to any requirements of law, the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, any provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation. For the avoidance of doubt, abstentions shall not count as "votes cast," except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation). 
ARTICLE X 
LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

ARTICLE XI 
FORUM FOR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES 
Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court of Chancery") shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder of the Corporation (including a beneficial owner of stock) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Corporation, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except as to each of (i) through (iv) above, for any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. If any provision or provisions of this Article XI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Article XI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

ARTICLE II 
MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
Section 2.1    Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of Directors. 
Section 2.2    Special Meeting. 
Except as otherwise required by law, and except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock (each hereinafter referred to as a "Preferred Stock Designation"), a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called at any time only by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of Directors. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. 
Section 2.3    Notice of Stockholders' Meetings. 
(a)    Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice of the place, if any, date, and time of the meeting of stockholders, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be given. The notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or these Bylaws. In the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called also shall be set forth in the notice. Except as otherwise required by law, notice may be given personally or by mail, or by electronic transmission to the extent permitted by Section 232 of the General 
B-1 
 Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). If mailed, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to each stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notice by electronic transmission shall be deemed given as provided in Section 232 of the DGCL. An affidavit that notice has been given, executed by the Secretary of the Corporation, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the notice in the absence of fraud. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Section 233 of the DGCL. 
(b)    When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, if any, date and time thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 7.6(a), and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. 
Section 2.4    Organization. 
(a)    Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in his or her absence, by the Chief Executive Officer or, in his or her absence, by another person designated by the Board of Directors. The Secretary of the Corporation, or in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary and all Assistant Secretaries, a person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint, shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep a record of the proceedings thereof. 
(b)    The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders shall vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be announced at the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the authority to adopt and enforce such rules and regulations for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders and the safety of those in attendance as, in the judgment of the chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the conduct of the meeting. Rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or by the chairman of the meeting, may include without limitation, establishing: (i) an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall permit; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; (v) limitations on the time allotted for consideration of each agenda item and for questions and comments by participants; (vi) regulations for the opening and closing of the polls for balloting and matters which are to be voted on by ballot (if any); and (vii) procedures (if any) requiring attendees to provide the Corporation advance notice of their intent to attend the meeting. Subject to any rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting may convene and, for any reason, from time to time, adjourn and/or recess any meeting of stockholders pursuant to Section 2.7. The chairman of the meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall have the power to declare that a nomination or other business was not properly brought before the meeting if the facts warrant (including if a determination is made, pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(i) of these Bylaws, that a nomination or other business was not made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 2.10 of these Bylaws), and if such chairman should so declare, such nomination shall be disregarded or such other business shall not be transacted. 
B-2 
Section 2.5    List of Stockholders. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date. Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical order and shall show the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing in this Section 2.5 shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting; or (b) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise required by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 2.5 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 
Section 2.6    Quorum. Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or these Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders, a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; provided, however, that where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the voting power of the stock of such class or series or classes or series outstanding and entitled to vote on that matter, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to such matter. If a quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, then the chairman of the meeting, or a majority of the voting power of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, shall have power to adjourn or recess the meeting from time to time in accordance with Section 2.7, until a quorum is present or represented. Subject to applicable law, if a quorum initially is present at any meeting of stockholders, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment or recess, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, but if a quorum is not present at least initially, no business other than adjournment or recess may be transacted. 
Section 2.7    Adjourned or Recessed Meeting. Any annual or special meeting of stockholders, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned or recessed for any reason from time to time by the chairman of the meeting, subject to any rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.4(b). Any such meeting may be adjourned for any reason (and may be recessed if a quorum is not present or represented) from time to time by a majority of the voting power of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. At any such adjourned or recessed meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. 
Section 2.8    Voting. 
(a)    Except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), each holder of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock held of record by such holder that has voting power upon the subject matter in question. 
(b)    Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), these Bylaws or any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, at 
B-3 
 each meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present, all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the stockholders shall be authorized by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter and voting together as a single class, and where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, if a quorum of such class or series or classes or series is present, such act shall be authorized by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively by such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter. For the avoidance of doubt, abstentions shall not count as "votes cast," except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation), these Bylaws or any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot. 
Section 2.9    Proxies. Every stockholder entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more persons authorized to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or executed new proxy bearing a later date. 
Section 2.10    Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations. 
(a)    Annual Meeting. 
(i)    Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business other than nominations to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only: (A) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto); (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any authorized committee thereof); or (C) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.10(a) is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.10(a). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (C) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or propose other business at an annual meeting of stockholders (other than a proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act). 
(ii)    For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of the foregoing paragraph, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and, in the case of business other than nominations, such business must be a proper subject for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business (as defined in Section 2.10(c)(ii) below) on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after such anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the date on which public announcement (as defined in Section 2.10(c)(ii) below) of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall an adjournment or recess of an annual meeting, or a postponement of an annual meeting for which notice of the meeting has already been given to stockholders or a public announcement of the meeting date has already 
B-4

(a)    Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or was or is otherwise involved in, any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, judicial, administrative or legislative hearing, or any other threatened, pending or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation or otherwise, including any and all appeals, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, investigative or other nature (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or while a director or officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), or by reason of anything done or not done by him or her in any such capacity, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of the indemnitee) actually and reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection therewith, all on the terms and conditions set forth in these Bylaws; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law or provided in Section 6.3 with respect to suits to enforce rights under this Article VI, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding, or part thereof, voluntarily initiated by such indemnitee (including claims and counterclaims, whether such counterclaims are asserted by: (i) such indemnitee; or (ii) the Corporation in a proceeding initiated by such indemnitee) only if such proceeding, or part thereof, was authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors otherwise determines that indemnification or advancement of expenses is appropriate. 
Section 6.2    Right to Advancement of Expenses. 
(a)    In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 6.1, an indemnitee shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that an advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, 
B-13 
 to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article VI or otherwise. 
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6.2(a), the Corporation shall not make or continue to make advancements of expenses to an indemnitee if a determination is reasonably made that the facts known at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that the indemnitee acted in bad faith or in a manner that the indemnitee did not reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such determination shall be made: (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who are not parties to such proceeding, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the indemnitee. 
Section 6.3    Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a request for indemnification under Section 6.1 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days, or if a request for an advancement of expenses under Section 6.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 20 days, after a written request has been received by the Secretary of the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Further, in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under applicable law, this Article VI or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 
Section 6.4    Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, provisions of a certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or otherwise. 
Section 6.5    Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. 
B-14 
Section 6.6    Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. The Corporation may, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, and to the extent authorized from time to time, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation. 
Section 6.7    Nature of Rights. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VI that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. 
Section 6.8    Settlement of Claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Article VI to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify any indemnitee under this Article VI for any amounts paid in settlement of any proceeding effected without the Corporation's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Section 6.9    Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Article VI, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee (excluding insurance obtained on the indemnitee's own behalf), and the indemnitee shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
Section 6.10    Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Article VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not by themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities or circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent of the parties that the Corporation provide protection to the indemnitee to the fullest extent set forth in this Article VI. 
ARTICLE VII

Section 7.1    Certificates of Stock. The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by any two authorized officers of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Secretary, or any President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Controller or Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the Corporation. Any or all such signatures may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 
Section 7.2    Special Designation on Certificates. If the Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the 
B-15 
 relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this Section 7.2 or Sections 151, 156, 202(a) or 218(a) of the DGCL or with respect to this Section 7.2 and Section 151 of the DGCL a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

Section 7.3    Transfers of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation upon authorization by the registered holder thereof or by such holder's attorney thereunto authorized by a power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or a transfer agent for such stock, and if such shares are represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power and the payment of any taxes thereon; provided, however, that the Corporation shall be entitled to recognize and enforce any lawful restriction on transfer. 
Section 7.4    Lost Certificates. The Corporation may issue a new share certificate or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or the owner's legal representative to give the Corporation a bond (or other adequate security) sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it (including any expense or liability) on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. The Board of Directors may adopt such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost certificates, not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem appropriate. 
Section 7.5    Registered Stockholders. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise required by law. 
Section 7.6    Record Date for Determining Stockholders. 
(a)    In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on 
B-16 
 which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjourned meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting. 
(b)    In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
Section 7.7    Regulations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board of Directors may make such additional rules and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock of the Corporation. 
Section 7.8    Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

3.    Administration. 
(a)    Authority of the Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee except to the extent the Board elects to administer the Plan, in which case references herein to the "Committee" shall be deemed to include references to the "Board." Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, Rule 16b-3 and other applicable laws, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to: 
(i)    designate Eligible Persons as Participants; 
(ii)    determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to an Eligible Person; 
(iii)    determine the number of shares of Stock or amount of cash to be covered by Awards; 
(iv)    determine the terms and conditions of any Award, including whether, to what extent and under what circumstances Awards may be vested, settled, exercised, cancelled or forfeited (including conditions based on continued employment or service requirements or the achievement of one or more performance goals); 
(v)    modify, waive or adjust any term or condition of an Award that has been granted, which may include the acceleration of vesting, waiver of forfeiture restrictions, modification of the form of settlement of the Award (for example, from cash to Stock or vice versa), early termination of a performance period, or modification of any other condition or limitation regarding an Award; 
(vi)    determine the treatment of an Award upon a termination of employment or other service relationship; 
(vii)    impose a holding period with respect to an Award or the shares of Stock received in connection with an Award; 
(viii)    interpret and administer the Plan and any Award Agreement; 
(ix)    correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, in any Award, or in any Award Agreement; and 
(x)    make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. 
The express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the Committee. Any action of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its Affiliates, stockholders, Participants, beneficiaries, and permitted transferees under Section 7(a) or other persons claiming rights from or through a Participant. 
(b)    Exercise of Committee Authority. At any time that a member of the Committee is not a Qualified Member, any action of the Committee relating to an Award granted or to be granted to an Eligible Person who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company where such action is not taken by the full Board may be taken either (i) by a subcommittee, designated by the Committee, composed solely of two or more Qualified Members, or (ii) by the Committee but with each such member who is not a Qualified Member abstaining or recusing himself or herself from such action; provided, however, that upon such abstention or recusal, the Committee remains composed solely of two or more Qualified Members. Such action, authorized by such a subcommittee or by the Committee upon the abstention or recusal of such non-Qualified Member(s), shall be the action of the Committee for purposes of the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the full Board may take any action relating to an Award granted or to be granted to an Eligible Person who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company. 
C-5 
(c)    Delegation of Authority. The Committee may delegate any or all of its powers and duties under the Plan to a subcommittee of directors or to any officer of the Company, including the power to perform administrative functions and grant Awards; provided, however, that such delegation does not (i) violate state or corporate law, or (ii) result in the loss of an exemption under Rule 16b-3(d)(1) for Awards granted to Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company. Upon any such delegation, all references in the Plan to the "Committee," other than in Section 8, shall be deemed to include any subcommittee or officer of the Company to whom such powers have been delegated by the Committee. Any such delegation shall not limit the right of such subcommittee members or such an officer to receive Awards; provided, however, that such subcommittee members and any such officer may not grant Awards to himself or herself, a member of the Board, or any executive officer of the Company or an Affiliate, or take any action with respect to any Award previously granted to himself or herself, a member of the Board, or any executive officer of the Company or an Affiliate. The Committee may also appoint agents who are not executive officers of the Company or members of the Board to assist in administering the Plan, provided, however, that such individuals may not be delegated the authority to grant or modify any Awards that will, or may, be settled in Stock. 
(d)    Limitation of Liability. The Committee and each member thereof shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to him or her by any officer or employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, the Company's legal counsel, independent auditors, consultants or any other agents assisting in the administration of the Plan. Members of the Committee and any officer or employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates acting at the direction or on behalf of the Committee shall not be personally liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be indemnified and held harmless by the Company with respect to any such action or determination. 
(e)    Participants in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, to comply with applicable laws in countries other than the United States in which the Company or any of its Affiliates operates or has employees, directors or other service providers from time to time, or to ensure that the Company complies with any applicable requirements of foreign securities exchanges, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to: (i) determine which of the Company's Affiliates shall be covered by the Plan; (ii) determine which Eligible Persons outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; (iii) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Eligible Persons outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws or listing requirements of any foreign exchange; (iv) establish sub-plans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable (any such sub-plans and/or modifications shall be attached to the Plan as appendices), provided, however, that no such sub-plans and/or modifications shall increase the share limitations contained in Section 4(a); and (v) take any action, before or after an Award is granted, that it deems advisable to comply with any applicable governmental regulatory exemptions or approval or listing requirements of any such foreign securities exchange. For purposes of the Plan, all references to foreign laws, rules, regulations or taxes shall be references to the laws, rules, regulations and taxes of any applicable jurisdiction other than the United States or a political subdivision thereof. 
4.    Stock Subject to Plan. 
(a)    Number of Shares Available for Delivery. Subject to adjustment in a manner consistent with Section 8, 8,731,053 shares of Stock are reserved and available for delivery with respect to Awards, and such total shall be available for the issuance of shares upon the exercise of ISOs. 
(b)    Application of Limitation to Grants of Awards. Subject to Section 4(c), no Award may be granted if the number of shares of Stock that may be delivered in connection with such Award exceeds the number of shares of Stock remaining available under the Plan minus the number of shares of Stock issuable in settlement of or relating to then-outstanding Awards. The Committee may adopt reasonable counting procedures to ensure 
C-6 
 appropriate counting, avoid double counting (as, for example, in the case of tandem or Substitute Awards) and make adjustments if the number of shares of Stock actually delivered differs from the number of shares previously counted in connection with an Award. 
(c)    Availability of Shares Not Delivered under Awards. Shares of Stock subject to an Award under the Plan that expires or is cancelled, forfeited, exchanged, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without the actual delivery of shares (Awards of Restricted Stock shall not be considered "delivered shares" for this purpose), will again be available for Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the number of shares tendered or withheld in payment of any exercise or purchase price of an Award or taxes relating to an Award, (ii) shares that were subject to an Option or an SAR but were not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement or net exercise of such Option or SAR and (iii) shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an Option's exercise price, will not, in each case, be available for Awards. 
(d)    Shares Available Following Certain Transactions. Substitute Awards granted in accordance with applicable stock exchange requirements and in substitution or exchange for awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or any subsidiary or with which the Company or any subsidiary combines shall not reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the Plan or the limitations on grants to non-employee members of the Board under Section 5(b), nor shall shares subject to such Substitute Awards be added to the shares available for issuance under the Plan as provided above (whether or not such Substitute Awards are later cancelled, forfeited or otherwise terminated). Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any subsidiary or with which the Company or any subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may, if and to the extent determined by the Board and subject to compliance with applicable stock exchange requirements, be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the Plan (and shares subject to such Awards shall not be added to the shares available for issuance under the Plan as provided above); provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not, prior to such acquisition or combination, employed by (and who were not non-employee directors or consultants of) the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition or combination. 
(e)    Stock Offered. The shares of Stock to be delivered under the Plan shall be made available from (i) authorized but unissued shares of Stock, (ii) Stock held in the treasury of the Company, or (iii) previously issued shares of Stock reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased on the open market. 
5.    Eligibility; Award Limitations for Non-Employee Members of the Board. 
(a)    Awards may be granted under the Plan only to Eligible Persons. 
(b)    In each calendar year during any part of which the Plan is in effect, a non-employee member of the Board may not be paid compensation, whether denominated in cash or Awards, for such individual's service on the Board in excess of $500,000, pro-rated for partial calendar years of Board service; provided, however, that for any calendar year in which a member of the Board (i) first becomes a member of the Board, (ii) serves on a special committee of the Board or (iii) serves as lead director, additional compensation, whether denominated in cash or Awards, may be paid. For purposes of this Section 5(b), the value of Awards shall be determined, if applicable, pursuant to ASC Topic 718 on the date of grant and attributed to the compensation limit for the year in which the Award is granted. For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set forth in this Section 5(b) shall be without regard to grants of Awards or other payments, if any, made to a non-employee member of the Board during any period in which such individual was an employee of the Company or of any of its Affiliates or was otherwise providing services to the Company or to any of its Affiliates other than in the capacity as a director of the Company. 
C-7 
6.    Specific Terms of Awards. 
(a)    General. Awards may be granted on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6. Awards granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with any other Award. In addition, the Committee may impose on any Award or the exercise thereof, at the date of grant or thereafter (subject to Section 10), such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, the Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance goals applicable to an Award, and any such performance goals may differ among Awards granted to any one Participant or to different Participants. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, the Committee may exercise its discretion to reduce or increase the amounts payable under any Award. 
(b)    Options. The Committee is authorized to grant Options, which may be designated as either ISOs or Nonstatutory Options, to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: 
(i)    Exercise Price. Each Award Agreement evidencing an Option shall state the exercise price per share of Stock (the "Exercise Price") established by the Committee; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 6(j) or in Section 8, the Exercise Price of an Option shall not be less than the greater of (A) the par value per share of the Stock or (B) 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock as of the date of grant of the Option (or in the case of an ISO granted to an individual who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or its parent or any of its subsidiaries, 110% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock on the date of grant). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exercise Price of a Nonstatutory Option may be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of Stock as of the date of grant of the Option if the Option (1) does not provide for a deferral of compensation by reason of satisfying the short-term deferral exception set forth in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules or (2) provides for a deferral of compensation and is compliant with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. 
(ii)    Time and Method of Exercise; Other Terms. The Committee shall determine the methods by which the Exercise Price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of such payment, including cash or cash equivalents, Stock (including previously owned shares or through a cashless exercise, i.e., "net settlement", a broker-assisted exercise, or other reduction of the amount of shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Option), other Awards or awards granted under other plans of the Company or any Affiliate, other property, or any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate (including notes or other contractual obligations of Participants to make payment on a deferred basis), the methods by or forms in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants, including the delivery of Restricted Stock subject to Section 6(d), and any other terms and conditions of any Option. In the case of an exercise whereby the Exercise Price is paid with Stock, such Stock shall be valued based on the Stock's Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise. No Option may be exercisable for a period of more than ten years following the date of grant of the Option (or in the case of an ISO granted to an individual who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or its parent or any of its subsidiaries, for a period of more than five years following the date of grant of the ISO). 
(iii)    ISOs. The terms of any ISO granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code. ISOs may only be granted to Eligible Persons who are employees of the Company or employees of a parent or any subsidiary corporation of the Company. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8, no term of the Plan relating to ISOs (including any SAR in tandem therewith) shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify either the Plan or any ISO under Section 422 of the Code, unless notice has been provided to the Participant that such change will result in such disqualification. ISOs shall not be granted more than ten years after the earlier of the adoption of the Plan or the approval of the Plan by the Company's stockholders. Notwithstanding the 
C-8 
 foregoing, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of shares of Stock subject to an ISO and the aggregate Fair Market Value of shares of stock of any parent or subsidiary corporation (within the meaning of Sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code) subject to any other incentive stock options of the Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation (within the meaning of Sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code) that are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as may be prescribed under Section 422 of the Code, such excess shall be treated as Nonstatutory Options in accordance with the Code. As used in the previous sentence, Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the date the ISO is granted. If a Participant shall make any disposition of shares of Stock issued pursuant to an ISO under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to disqualifying dispositions), the Participant shall notify the Company of such disposition within the time provided to do so in the applicable award agreement. 
(c)    SARs. The Committee is authorized to grant SARs to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: 
(i)    Right to Payment. An SAR is a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of exercise over (B) the grant price of the SAR as determined by the Committee. 
(ii)    Grant Price. Each Award Agreement evidencing an SAR shall state the grant price per share of Stock established by the Committee; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 6(j) or in Section 8, the grant price per share of Stock subject to an SAR shall not be less than the greater of (A) the par value per share of the Stock or (B) 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of the Stock as of the date of grant of the SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the grant price of an SAR may be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of Stock subject to an SAR as of the date of grant of the SAR if the SAR (1) does not provide for a deferral of compensation by reason of satisfying the short-term deferral exception set forth in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules or (2) provides for a deferral of compensation and is compliant with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. 
(iii)    Method of Exercise and Settlement; Other Terms. The Committee shall determine the form of consideration payable upon settlement, the method by or forms in which Stock (if any) will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants, and any other terms and conditions of any SAR. SARs may be either free-standing or granted in tandem with other Awards. No SAR may be exercisable for a period of more than ten years following the date of grant of the SAR. 
(iv)    Rights Related to Options. An SAR granted in connection with an Option shall entitle a Participant, upon exercise, to surrender that Option or any portion thereof, to the extent unexercised, and to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying (A) the difference obtained by subtracting the Exercise Price with respect to a share of Stock specified in the related Option from the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR, by (B) the number of shares as to which that SAR has been exercised. The Option shall then cease to be exercisable to the extent surrendered. SARs granted in connection with an Option shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement governing the Option, which shall provide that the SAR is exercisable only at such time or times and only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable and shall not be transferable except to the extent that the related Option is transferrable. 
(d)    Restricted Stock. The Committee is authorized to grant Restricted Stock to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: 
(i)    Restrictions. Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture and other restrictions, if any, as the Committee may impose. Except as provided in Section 7(a)(iii) and Section 7(a)(iv), during the restricted period applicable to the Restricted Stock, the Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hedged, hypothecated, margined or otherwise encumbered by the Participant. 
C-9 
(ii)    Dividends and Splits. As a condition to the grant of an Award of Restricted Stock, the Committee may allow a Participant to elect, or may require, that any cash dividends paid on a share of Restricted Stock be automatically reinvested in additional shares of Restricted Stock, applied to the purchase of additional Awards or deferred without interest to the date of vesting of the associated Award of Restricted Stock. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and specified in the applicable Award Agreement, Stock distributed in connection with a Stock split or Stock dividend, and other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend, shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Stock or other property has been distributed. 
(e)    Restricted Stock Units. The Committee is authorized to grant Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: 
(i)    Award and Restrictions. Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions (which may include a risk of forfeiture) as the Committee may impose. 
(ii)    Settlement. Settlement of vested Restricted Stock Units shall occur upon vesting or upon expiration of the deferral period specified for such Restricted Stock Units by the Committee (or, if permitted by the Committee, as elected by the Participant). Restricted Stock Units shall be settled by delivery of (A) a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units for which settlement is due, or (B) cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the specified number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units for which settlement is due, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee at the date of grant or thereafter. 
(f)    Stock Awards. The Committee is authorized to grant Stock Awards to Eligible Persons as a bonus, as additional compensation, or in lieu of cash compensation any such Eligible Person is otherwise entitled to receive, in such amounts and subject to such other terms as the Committee in its discretion determines to be appropriate. 
(g)    Dividend Equivalents. The Committee is authorized to grant Dividend Equivalents to Eligible Persons, entitling any such Eligible Person to receive cash, Stock, other Awards, or other property equal in value to dividends or other distributions paid with respect to a specified number of shares of Stock. Dividend Equivalents may be awarded on a free-standing basis or in connection with another Award (other than an Award of Restricted Stock or a Stock Award). The Committee may provide that Dividend Equivalents shall be paid or distributed when accrued or at a later specified date and, if distributed at a later date, may be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Stock, Awards, or other investment vehicles or accrued in a bookkeeping account without interest, and subject to such restrictions on transferability and risks of forfeiture, as the Committee may specify. With respect to Dividend Equivalents granted in connection with another Award, absent a contrary provision in the Award Agreement, such Dividend Equivalents shall be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the Award with respect to which the dividends accrue and shall not be paid unless and until such Award has vested and been earned. 
(h)    Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Eligible Persons such other Awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Stock, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan, including convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Stock, purchase rights for Stock, Awards with value and payment contingent upon performance of the Company or any other factors designated by the Committee, and Awards valued by reference to the book value of Stock or the value of securities of, or the performance of, specified Affiliates of the Company. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Other Stock-Based Awards. Stock delivered pursuant to an Other-Stock Based Award in the nature of a purchase right granted under this Section 6(h) shall be purchased for such consideration, paid for at such times, by such methods, and in such forms, including cash, Stock, other Awards, or other property, as the Committee shall determine. 
C-10 
(i)    Cash Awards. The Committee is authorized to grant Cash Awards, on a free-standing basis or as an element of, a supplement to, or in lieu of any other Award under the Plan to Eligible Persons in such amounts and subject to such other terms as the Committee in its discretion determines to be appropriate. 
(j)    Substitute Awards; No Repricing. Awards may be granted in substitution or exchange for any other Award granted under the Plan or under another plan of the Company or an Affiliate or any other right of an Eligible Person to receive payment from the Company or an Affiliate. Awards may also be granted under the Plan in substitution for awards held by individuals who become Eligible Persons as a result of a merger, consolidation or acquisition of another entity or the assets of another entity by or with the Company or an Affiliate. Such Substitute Awards referred to in the immediately preceding sentence that are Options or SARs may have an exercise price that is less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of the substitution if such substitution complies with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules and other applicable laws and exchange rules. Except as provided in this Section 6(j) or in Section 8, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, the terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended to (i) reduce the Exercise Price or grant price of an outstanding Option or SAR, (ii) grant a new Option, SAR or other Award in substitution for, or upon the cancellation of, any previously granted Option or SAR that has the effect of reducing the Exercise Price or grant price thereof, (iii) exchange any Option or SAR for Stock, cash or other consideration when the Exercise Price or grant price per share of Stock under such Option or SAR exceeds the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock or (iv) take any other action that would be considered a "repricing" of an Option or SAR under the applicable listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Stock is listed (if any). 
7.    Certain Provisions Applicable to Awards. 
(a)    Limit on Transfer of Awards. 
(i)    Except as provided in Sections 7(a)(iii) and (iv), each Option and SAR shall be exercisable only by the Participant during the Participant's lifetime, or by the person to whom the Participant's rights shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7(a), an ISO shall not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
(ii)    Except as provided in Sections 7(a)(i), (iii) and (iv), no Award, other than a Stock Award, and no right under any such Award, may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. 
(iii)    To the extent specifically provided by the Committee, an Award may be transferred by a Participant without consideration to immediate family members or related family trusts, limited partnerships or similar entities or on such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time establish. 
(iv)    An Award may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order entered or approved by a court of competent jurisdiction upon delivery to the Company of a written request for such transfer and a certified copy of such order. 
(b)    Form and Timing of Payment under Awards; Deferrals. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, payments to be made by the Company or any of its Affiliates upon the exercise or settlement of an Award may be made in such forms as the Committee shall determine in its discretion, including cash, Stock, other Awards or other property, and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on a deferred basis (which may be required by the Committee or permitted at the election of the Participant on terms and conditions established by the Committee); provided, however, that any such deferred or installment payments will be set forth in the Award Agreement. Payments may include, without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of Dividend Equivalents or other amounts in respect of installment or deferred payments denominated in Stock. 
C-11 
(c)    Evidencing Stock. The Stock or other securities of the Company delivered pursuant to an Award may be evidenced in any manner deemed appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion, including in the form of a certificate issued in the name of the Participant or by book entry, electronic or otherwise, and shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which such Stock or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal, state or other laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be inscribed on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. Further, if certificates representing Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the Participant, the Company may retain physical possession of the certificates and may require that the Participant deliver a stock power to the Company, endorsed in blank, related to the Restricted Stock. 
(d)    Consideration for Grants. Awards may be granted for such consideration, including services, as the Committee shall determine, but shall not be granted for less than the minimum lawful consideration. 
(e)    Additional Agreements. Each Eligible Person to whom an Award is granted under the Plan may be required to agree in writing, as a condition to the grant of such Award or otherwise, to subject an Award that is exercised or settled following such Eligible Person's termination of employment or service to a general release of claims and/or a noncompetition or other restricted covenant agreement in favor of the Company and its Affiliates, with the terms and conditions of such agreement(s) to be determined in good faith by the Committee. 
8.    Subdivision or Consolidation; Recapitalization; Change in Control; Reorganization. 
(a)    Existence of Plans and Awards. The existence of the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company, the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of debt or equity securities ahead of or affecting Stock or the rights thereof, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or any part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding. 
(b)    Additional Issuances. Except as expressly provided herein, the issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, including upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, and in any case whether or not for fair value, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares of Stock subject to Awards theretofore granted or the purchase price per share of Stock, if applicable. 
(c)    Subdivision or Consolidation of Shares. The terms of an Award and the share limitations under the Plan shall be subject to adjustment by the Committee from time to time, in accordance with the following provisions: 
(i)    If at any time, or from time to time, the Company shall subdivide as a whole (by reclassification, by a Stock split, by the issuance of a distribution on Stock payable in Stock, or otherwise) the number of shares of Stock then outstanding into a greater number of shares of Stock or in the event the Company distributes an extraordinary cash dividend, then, as appropriate (A) the maximum number of shares of Stock available for delivery with respect to Awards and applicable limitations with respect to Awards provided in Section 4 and Section 5 (other than cash limits) shall be increased proportionately, and the kind of shares or other securities available for the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted, (B) the number of shares of Stock (or other kind of shares or securities) that may be acquired under any then outstanding Award shall be increased proportionately, and (C) the price (including the Exercise Price or grant price) for each share of Stock (or other kind of shares or securities) subject to then outstanding Awards shall be reduced proportionately, without changing the aggregate purchase price or value as to which outstanding Awards remain exercisable or subject to restrictions; provided, however, that in the case of an extraordinary cash dividend that is not an Adjustment 
C-12 
 Event, the adjustment to the number of shares of Stock and the Exercise Price or grant price, as applicable, with respect to an outstanding Option or SAR may be made in such other manner as the Committee may determine that is permitted pursuant to applicable tax and other laws, rules and regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Awards that already have a right to receive extraordinary cash dividends as a result of DERs or other dividend rights will not be adjusted as a result of an extraordinary cash dividend. 
(ii)    If at any time, or from time to time, the Company shall consolidate as a whole (by reclassification, by reverse Stock split, or otherwise) the number of shares of Stock then outstanding into a lesser number of shares of Stock, then, as appropriate (A) the maximum number of shares of Stock available for delivery with respect to Awards and applicable limitations with respect to Awards provided in Section 4 and Section 5 (other than cash limits) shall be decreased proportionately, and the kind of shares or other securities available for the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted, (B) the number of shares of Stock (or other kind of shares or securities) that may be acquired under any then outstanding Award shall be decreased proportionately, and (C) the price (including the Exercise Price or grant price) for each share of Stock (or other kind of shares or securities) subject to then outstanding Awards shall be increased proportionately, without changing the aggregate purchase price or value as to which outstanding Awards remain exercisable or subject to restrictions. 
(d)    Recapitalization. In the event of any change in the capital structure or business of the Company or other corporate transaction or event that would be considered an "equity restructuring" within the meaning of ASC Topic 718 and, in each case, that would result in an additional compensation expense to the Company pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 718, if adjustments to Awards with respect to such event were discretionary or otherwise not required (each such an event, an "Adjustment Event"), then the Committee shall equitably adjust (i) the aggregate number or kind of shares that thereafter may be delivered under the Plan, (ii) the number or kind of shares or other property (including cash) subject to an Award, (iii) the terms and conditions of Awards, including the purchase price or Exercise Price of Awards and performance goals, as applicable, and (iv) the applicable limitations with respect to Awards provided in Section 4 and Section 5 (other than cash limits) to equitably reflect such Adjustment Event ("Equitable Adjustments"). In the event of any change in the capital structure or business of the Company or other corporate transaction or event that would not be considered an Adjustment Event, and is not otherwise addressed in this Section 8, the Committee shall have complete discretion to make Equitable Adjustments (if any) in such manner as it deems appropriate with respect to such other event. 
(e)    Change in Control and Other Events. Except to the extent otherwise provided in any applicable Award Agreement, vesting of any Award shall not occur solely upon the occurrence of a Change in Control and, in the event of a Change in Control or other changes in the Company or the outstanding Stock by reason of a recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange or other relevant change occurring after the date of the grant of any Award, the Committee, acting in its sole discretion without the consent or approval of any holder, may exercise any power enumerated in Section 3 (including the power to accelerate vesting, waive any forfeiture conditions or otherwise modify or adjust any other condition or limitation regarding an Award) and may also effect one or more of the following alternatives, which may vary among individual holders and which may vary among Awards held by any individual holder: 
(i)    accelerate the time of exercisability of an Award so that such Award may be exercised in full or in part for a limited period of time on or before a date specified by the Committee, after which specified date all unexercised Awards and all rights of holders thereunder shall terminate; 
(ii)    redeem in whole or in part outstanding Awards by requiring the mandatory surrender to the Company by selected holders of some or all of the outstanding Awards held by such holders (irrespective of whether such Awards are then vested or exercisable) as of a date, specified by the Committee, in which event the Committee shall thereupon cancel such Awards and pay to each holder an amount of cash or other consideration per Award (other than a Dividend Equivalent or Cash Award, which the Committee may separately require to be surrendered in exchange for cash or other consideration determined by the Committee in its discretion) equal to 
C-13 
 the Change in Control Price, less the Exercise Price with respect to an Option and less the grant price with respect to a SAR, as applicable to such Awards; provided, however, that to the extent the Exercise Price of an Option or the grant price of an SAR exceeds the Change in Control Price, such Award may be cancelled for no consideration; or 
(iii)    make such adjustments to Awards then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control or other such event (including the substitution, assumption, or continuation of Awards by the successor company or a parent or subsidiary thereof); 
provided, however, that so long as the event is not an Adjustment Event, the Committee may determine in its sole discretion that no adjustment is necessary to Awards then outstanding. If an Adjustment Event occurs, this Section 8(e) shall only apply to the extent it is not in conflict with Section 8(d). 
9.    General Provisions. 
(a)    Tax Withholding. The Company and any of its Affiliates are authorized to withhold from any Award granted, or any payment relating to an Award, including from a distribution of Stock, taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company, its Affiliates and Participants to satisfy the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award in such amounts as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the form of payment acceptable for such tax withholding obligations, including the delivery of cash or cash equivalents, Stock (including previously owned shares, net settlement, a broker-assisted sale, or other cashless withholding or reduction of the amount of shares otherwise issuable or delivered pursuant to the Award), other property, or any other legal consideration the Committee deems appropriate. Any determination made by the Committee to allow a Participant who is subject to Rule 16b-3 to pay taxes with shares of Stock through net settlement or previously owned shares shall be approved by either a committee made up of solely two or more Qualified Members or the full Board. If such tax withholding amounts are satisfied through net settlement or previously owned shares, the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be so withheld or surrendered shall be the number of shares of Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or surrender equal to the aggregate amount of such tax liabilities determined based on the greatest withholding rates for federal, state, foreign and/or local tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that may be utilized without creating adverse accounting treatment for the Company with respect to such Award, as determined by the Committee. 
(b)    Limitation on Rights Conferred under Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as (i) giving any Eligible Person or Participant the right to continue as an Eligible Person or Participant or in the employ or service of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii) interfering in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate any Eligible Person's or Participant's employment or service relationship at any time, (iii) giving an Eligible Person or Participant any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan or to be treated uniformly with other Participants and/or employees and/or other service providers, or (iv) conferring on a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Participant is duly issued or transferred shares of Stock in accordance with the terms of an Award. 
(c)    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. All questions arising with respect to the provisions of the Plan and Awards shall be determined by application of the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions thereof, except to the extent Delaware law is preempted by federal law. The obligation of the Company to sell and deliver Stock hereunder is subject to applicable federal and state laws and to the approval of any governmental authority required in connection with the authorization, issuance, sale, or delivery of such Stock. With respect to any claim or dispute related to or arising under the Plan, the Company and each Participant who accepts an Award hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the state and federal courts located in Harris County, Texas. 
C-14 
(d)    Severability and Reformation. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable law or, if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. If any of the terms or provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement conflict with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 (as those terms or provisions are applied to Eligible Persons who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act) or Section 422 of the Code (with respect to ISOs), then those conflicting terms or provisions shall be deemed inoperative to the extent they so conflict with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 (unless the Board or the Committee, as appropriate, has expressly determined that the Plan or such Award should not comply with Rule 16b-3) or Section 422 of the Code, in each case, only to the extent Rule 16b-3 and such sections of the Code are applicable. With respect to ISOs, if the Plan does not contain any provision required to be included herein under Section 422 of the Code, that provision shall be deemed to be incorporated herein with the same force and effect as if that provision had been set out at length herein; provided, further, that, to the extent any Option that is intended to qualify as an ISO cannot so qualify, that Option (to that extent) shall be deemed a Nonstatutory Option for all purposes of the Plan. 
(e)    Unfunded Status of Awards; No Trust or Fund Created. The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for certain incentive awards. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any general unsecured creditor of the Company or such Affiliate. 
(f)    Nonexclusivity of the Plan. Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor its submission to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or a committee thereof to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company or any of its Affiliates from taking any corporate action which is deemed by the Company or such Affiliate to be appropriate or in its best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on the Plan or any Award made under the Plan. No employee, beneficiary or other person shall have any claim against the Company or any of its Affiliates as a result of any such action. 
(g)    Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional shares of Stock or whether such fractional shares of Stock or any rights thereto shall be cancelled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated with or without consideration. 
(h)    Interpretation. Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof. Words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender, and, where appropriate, the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of an Award Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall control. The use herein of the word "including" following any general statement, term or matter shall not be construed to limit such statement, term or matter to the specific items or matters set forth immediately following such word or to similar items or matters, whether or not non-limiting language (such as "without limitation", "but not limited to", or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto, but rather shall be deemed to refer to all other items or matters that could reasonably fall within the broadest possible scope of such general statement, term or matter. References herein to any agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof and not prohibited by the Plan. 
C-15 
(i)    Facility of Payment. Any amounts payable hereunder to any individual under legal disability or who, in the judgment of the Committee, is unable to manage properly his financial affairs, may be paid to the legal representative of such individual, or may be applied for the benefit of such individual in any manner that the Committee may select, and the Company shall be relieved of any further liability for payment of such amounts. 
(j)    Conditions to Delivery of Stock. Nothing herein or in any Award Agreement shall require the Company to issue any shares with respect to any Award if that issuance would, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, constitute a violation of the Securities Act, any other applicable statute or regulation, or the rules of any applicable securities exchange or securities association, as then in effect. In addition, each Participant who receives an Award under the Plan shall not sell or otherwise dispose of Stock that is acquired upon grant, exercise or vesting of an Award in any manner that would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws, the Plan or the rules, regulations or other requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange upon which the Stock is then listed. At the time of any exercise of an Option or SAR, or at the time of any grant of any other Award, the Company may, as a condition precedent to the exercise of such Option or SAR or settlement of any other Award, require from the Participant (or in the event of his or her death, his or her legal representatives, heirs, legatees, or distributees) such written representations, if any, concerning the holder's intentions with regard to the retention or disposition of the shares of Stock being acquired pursuant to the Award and such written covenants and agreements, if any, as to the manner of disposal of such shares as, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, may be necessary to ensure that any disposition by that holder (or in the event of the holder's death, his or her legal representatives, heirs, legatees, or distributees) will not involve a violation of the Securities Act, any other applicable state or federal statute or regulation, or any rule of any applicable securities exchange or securities association, as then in effect. Stock or other securities shall not be delivered pursuant to any Award until payment in full of any amount required to be paid pursuant to the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement (including any Exercise Price, grant price, or tax withholding) is received by the Company. 
(k)    Section 409A of the Code. It is the general intention, but not the obligation, of the Committee to design Awards to comply with or to be exempt from the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, and Awards will be operated and construed accordingly. Neither this Section 9(k) nor any other provision of the Plan is or contains a representation to any Participant regarding the tax consequences of the grant, vesting, exercise, settlement, or sale of any Award (or the Stock underlying such Award) granted hereunder, and should not be interpreted as such. In no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Participant on account of non-compliance with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, in the event that a "specified employee" (as defined under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules) becomes entitled to a payment under an Award that would be subject to additional taxes and interest under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules if the Participant's receipt of such payment or benefits is not delayed until the earlier of (i) the date of the Participant's death, or (ii) the date that is six months after the Participant's "separation from service," as defined under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules (such date, the "Section 409A Payment Date"), then such payment or benefit shall not be provided to the Participant until the Section 409A Payment Date. Any amounts subject to the preceding sentence that would otherwise be payable prior to the Section 409A Payment Date will be aggregated and paid in a lump sum without interest on the Section 409A Payment Date. The applicable provisions of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules are hereby incorporated by reference and shall control over any Plan or Award Agreement provision in conflict therewith. 
(l)    Clawback. The Plan and all Awards granted hereunder are subject to any written clawback policies that the Company, with the approval of the Board or an authorized committee thereof, may adopt either prior to or following the Effective Date, including any policy adopted to conform to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and rules promulgated thereunder by the SEC and that the Company determines should apply to Awards. Any such policy may subject a Participant's Awards and amounts paid or realized with respect to Awards to reduction, cancelation, forfeiture or recoupment if certain specified 
C-16 
 events or wrongful conduct occur, including an accounting restatement due to the Company's material noncompliance with financial reporting regulations or other events or wrongful conduct specified in any such clawback policy. 
(m)    Status under ERISA. The Plan shall not constitute an "employee benefit plan" for purposes of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
(n)    Plan Effective Date and Term. The Plan was adopted by the Board to be effective on the Effective Date. No Awards may be granted under the Plan on and after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, which is [● ], 2029. However, any Award granted prior to such termination (or any earlier termination pursuant to Section 10), and the authority of the Board or Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any such Award or to waive any conditions or rights under such Award in accordance with the terms of the Plan, shall extend beyond such termination until the final disposition of such Award. 
10.    Amendments to the Plan and Awards. The Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award or Award Agreement, the Plan or the Committee's authority to grant Awards without the consent of stockholders or Participants, except that any amendment or alteration to the Plan, including any increase in any share limitation, shall be subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders not later than the annual meeting next following such Committee action if such stockholder approval is required by any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may then be listed or quoted, and the Committee may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit other changes to the Plan to stockholders for approval; provided, that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Committee action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award. For purposes of clarity, any adjustments made to Awards pursuant to Section 8 will be deemed not to materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award and therefore may be made without the consent of affected Participants.
