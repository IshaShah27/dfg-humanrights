      Ben Johnson has served as Chairperson since 2014 and as a  non-executive director of our company since 2009.        Martin Flanagan has been a director and President and Chief  Executive Officer of our company since 2005.     Dear Fellow Shareholder,   First and foremost, we would like to express our sincere appreciation for your continued support as an Invesco shareholder. Our Board of Directors, our senior leadership  and our employees worldwide are committed to further strengthening our global firm and providing a high level of value to you, our shareholders, over the long term.   A look back at 2018 2018 was a challenging year for the asset management  industry. We saw volatile markets throughout 2018 and particularly during the fourth quarter. In fact, when you look across eight broad indices representing major equity, fixed income and commodity markets, 2018 was the worst year in several decades  for broad asset returns.1 The volatility in the markets impacted financial performance across the industry, particularly for global investment managers like Invesco. Shareholder returns for  traditional asset managers as a group were down 26%,2 while Invesco was down 54% for the year.3   The Board of Directors and the executive management team believe the underperformance of  Invescos stock price relative to our peer group reflects the following factors: ∎ Key investment capabilities that had helped produce nine consecutive years of positive net flows for the firm through 2017 underperformed materially in 2018, contributing to significant negative net  flows in 2018. Net flows, positive or negative, are a key driver of short-term shareholder returns for traditional asset managers. ∎ As described in more detail below, for much of 2018, we opted to use  our cash and credit resources to fund long-term investments to strengthen our business instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. ∎ Invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of our  peers. As one of the leading investment managers in the UK and Europe, we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Additionally, our strong position in Asia Pacific meant that Invesco was more affected than others by market  uncertainties over the trade issues between China and the US. We believe these factors led to additional negative sentiment on Invesco among investors in our shares.   Where we believe clients and the market are headed Its important to  remember that global assets under management (AUM) currently exceed $88 trillion,4 and total assets will continue to grow over the long term. More and more, clients are seeking to work with a  smaller number of asset managers who can meet a comprehensive set of needs. They want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives. They  also want greater value for their money, which, first and foremost, means competitively priced products, as well as investor education, thought leadership, digital platforms and other value adds that create an enhanced client experience.  These dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry that are real, impactful and enduring, and that will create winners and losers at an accelerated rate. We believe the steps weve taken over the past decade and throughout 2018  strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure Invesco is among the winners within our industry over the long term.

Where we believe clients and the market are headed Its important to  remember that global assets under management (AUM) currently exceed $88 trillion,4 and total assets will continue to grow over the long term. More and more, clients are seeking to work with a  smaller number of asset managers who can meet a comprehensive set of needs. They want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives. They  also want greater value for their money, which, first and foremost, means competitively priced products, as well as investor education, thought leadership, digital platforms and other value adds that create an enhanced client experience.  These dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry that are real, impactful and enduring, and that will create winners and losers at an accelerated rate. We believe the steps weve taken over the past decade and throughout 2018  strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure Invesco is among the winners within our industry over the long term. 
      Ben Johnson has served as Chairperson since 2014 and as a  non-executive director of our company since 2009.        Martin Flanagan has been a director and President and Chief  Executive Officer of our company since 2005.     Dear Fellow Shareholder,   First and foremost, we would like to express our sincere appreciation for your continued support as an Invesco shareholder. Our Board of Directors, our senior leadership  and our employees worldwide are committed to further strengthening our global firm and providing a high level of value to you, our shareholders, over the long term.   A look back at 2018 2018 was a challenging year for the asset management  industry. We saw volatile markets throughout 2018 and particularly during the fourth quarter. In fact, when you look across eight broad indices representing major equity, fixed income and commodity markets, 2018 was the worst year in several decades  for broad asset returns.1 The volatility in the markets impacted financial performance across the industry, particularly for global investment managers like Invesco. Shareholder returns for  traditional asset managers as a group were down 26%,2 while Invesco was down 54% for the year.3   The Board of Directors and the executive management team believe the underperformance of  Invescos stock price relative to our peer group reflects the following factors: ∎ Key investment capabilities that had helped produce nine consecutive years of positive net flows for the firm through 2017 underperformed materially in 2018, contributing to significant negative net  flows in 2018. Net flows, positive or negative, are a key driver of short-term shareholder returns for traditional asset managers. ∎ As described in more detail below, for much of 2018, we opted to use  our cash and credit resources to fund long-term investments to strengthen our business instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. ∎ Invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of our  peers. As one of the leading investment managers in the UK and Europe, we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Additionally, our strong position in Asia Pacific meant that Invesco was more affected than others by market  uncertainties over the trade issues between China and the US. We believe these factors led to additional negative sentiment on Invesco among investors in our shares.   Where we believe clients and the market are headed Its important to  remember that global assets under management (AUM) currently exceed $88 trillion,4 and total assets will continue to grow over the long term. More and more, clients are seeking to work with a  smaller number of asset managers who can meet a comprehensive set of needs. They want money managers who can provide a robust set of capabilities and create investment solutions that deliver key outcomes aligned to their investment objectives. They  also want greater value for their money, which, first and foremost, means competitively priced products, as well as investor education, thought leadership, digital platforms and other value adds that create an enhanced client experience.  These dynamics are driving fundamental changes within our industry that are real, impactful and enduring, and that will create winners and losers at an accelerated rate. We believe the steps weve taken over the past decade and throughout 2018  strengthened our ability to meet client needs and will help ensure Invesco is among the winners within our industry over the long term. 
           Although the markets are expected to remain volatile in 2019,  Invesco continues to focus on developing an elite set of capabilities aligned to clients evolving needs. Our comprehensive range of investment capabilities has been built over many years to help clients weather various market cycles, and we  believe the firm is better positioned than ever to provide the expert advice and key outcomes that will help clients navigate the challenging markets ahead.   Investing in the future of our business In late 2017 and throughout 2018, we  made several long-term investments that are intended to help us to better meet client needs, further strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term.   The most significant of these commitments is our planned acquisition of MassMutuals asset  management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will accelerate Invescos growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment capabilities.  We will also be better positioned to deliver strong outcomes for clients, since overall performance rankings for US mutual funds are consistently stronger for the combined firm than for either firm independently.5 Substantial synergies make the transaction materially accretive to earnings and will help us improve shareholder returns in both the short and long term.   Additionally, in 2018 we: ∎   Completed the acquisitions of Guggenheim Investments ETF  business in the US and Source in Europe, further expanding our comprehensive suite of ETFs. Invesco is now the #2 provider of smart beta AUM globally and has 60 ETFs with greater than $500 million in assets (as of December 31, 2018);6 ∎  Continued  to make good progress in China. Sourced gross flows amounted to US$13.9 billion for the year, and total AUM sourced from China reached US$37 billion (as at December 31, 2018). Our China joint venture, Invesco Great Wall, also successfully  onboarded a fund onto Ant Financials Yue Bao Money Market Fund platform. The fund reached over US$11 billion by the end of 2018 and continues to grow;7 ∎  Launched some of the industrys first self-indexed,  factor-based fixed income ETFs, building on more than 35 years of factor-based investment experience; ∎  Continued to enhance our culture and provide development opportunities for our talented professionals across the globe; ∎  Further strengthened our market-leading solutions capability,  leveraging one of the industrys strongest, most experienced solutions teams to deliver customized outcomes for clients; and ∎  Expanded our digital wealth platform with the addition of  Intelliflo, the No. 1 technology platform for financial advisors in the UK.   Taken  together, this work further expanded the broad range of capabilities Invesco uses to create solutions that deliver the outcomes clients are seeking, all wrapped in a robust, value-added client experience. These initiatives also further strengthen  the firms effectiveness and efficiency, providing greater economies of scale that will enable us to provide a higher level of value to clients and further improve our competitive position over the long term.   As noted above, we believe it is important to understand that, for much of 2018, we elected to  use our cash and credit resources to fund these initiatives instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. However, were confident that the investments we made in 2018  will drive greater shareholder value over the long term, given the macro trends in our operating environment and the importance of positioning the firm ahead of where clients, the industry and the markets are headed. In conjunction with the  OppenheimerFunds acquisition, we announced a two-year, $1.2 billion stock buyback program, and completed the first $300 million stock repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Investing in the future of our business In late 2017 and throughout 2018, we  made several long-term investments that are intended to help us to better meet client needs, further strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term.   The most significant of these commitments is our planned acquisition of MassMutuals asset  management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will accelerate Invescos growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment capabilities.  We will also be better positioned to deliver strong outcomes for clients, since overall performance rankings for US mutual funds are consistently stronger for the combined firm than for either firm independently.5 Substantial synergies make the transaction materially accretive to earnings and will help us improve shareholder returns in both the short and long term.   Additionally, in 2018 we: ∎   Completed the acquisitions of Guggenheim Investments ETF  business in the US and Source in Europe, further expanding our comprehensive suite of ETFs. Invesco is now the #2 provider of smart beta AUM globally and has 60 ETFs with greater than $500 million in assets (as of December 31, 2018);6 ∎  Continued  to make good progress in China. Sourced gross flows amounted to US$13.9 billion for the year, and total AUM sourced from China reached US$37 billion (as at December 31, 2018). Our China joint venture, Invesco Great Wall, also successfully  onboarded a fund onto Ant Financials Yue Bao Money Market Fund platform. The fund reached over US$11 billion by the end of 2018 and continues to grow;7 ∎  Launched some of the industrys first self-indexed,  factor-based fixed income ETFs, building on more than 35 years of factor-based investment experience; ∎  Continued to enhance our culture and provide development opportunities for our talented professionals across the globe; ∎  Further strengthened our market-leading solutions capability,  leveraging one of the industrys strongest, most experienced solutions teams to deliver customized outcomes for clients; and ∎  Expanded our digital wealth platform with the addition of  Intelliflo, the No. 1 technology platform for financial advisors in the UK.   Taken  together, this work further expanded the broad range of capabilities Invesco uses to create solutions that deliver the outcomes clients are seeking, all wrapped in a robust, value-added client experience. These initiatives also further strengthen  the firms effectiveness and efficiency, providing greater economies of scale that will enable us to provide a higher level of value to clients and further improve our competitive position over the long term.   As noted above, we believe it is important to understand that, for much of 2018, we elected to  use our cash and credit resources to fund these initiatives instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. However, were confident that the investments we made in 2018  will drive greater shareholder value over the long term, given the macro trends in our operating environment and the importance of positioning the firm ahead of where clients, the industry and the markets are headed. In conjunction with the  OppenheimerFunds acquisition, we announced a two-year, $1.2 billion stock buyback program, and completed the first $300 million stock repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Additionally, in 2018 we: ∎   Completed the acquisitions of Guggenheim Investments ETF  business in the US and Source in Europe, further expanding our comprehensive suite of ETFs. Invesco is now the #2 provider of smart beta AUM globally and has 60 ETFs with greater than $500 million in assets (as of December 31, 2018);6 ∎  Continued  to make good progress in China. Sourced gross flows amounted to US$13.9 billion for the year, and total AUM sourced from China reached US$37 billion (as at December 31, 2018). Our China joint venture, Invesco Great Wall, also successfully  onboarded a fund onto Ant Financials Yue Bao Money Market Fund platform. The fund reached over US$11 billion by the end of 2018 and continues to grow;7 ∎  Launched some of the industrys first self-indexed,  factor-based fixed income ETFs, building on more than 35 years of factor-based investment experience; ∎  Continued to enhance our culture and provide development opportunities for our talented professionals across the globe; ∎  Further strengthened our market-leading solutions capability,  leveraging one of the industrys strongest, most experienced solutions teams to deliver customized outcomes for clients; and ∎  Expanded our digital wealth platform with the addition of  Intelliflo, the No. 1 technology platform for financial advisors in the UK.   Taken  together, this work further expanded the broad range of capabilities Invesco uses to create solutions that deliver the outcomes clients are seeking, all wrapped in a robust, value-added client experience. These initiatives also further strengthen  the firms effectiveness and efficiency, providing greater economies of scale that will enable us to provide a higher level of value to clients and further improve our competitive position over the long term.   As noted above, we believe it is important to understand that, for much of 2018, we elected to  use our cash and credit resources to fund these initiatives instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. However, were confident that the investments we made in 2018  will drive greater shareholder value over the long term, given the macro trends in our operating environment and the importance of positioning the firm ahead of where clients, the industry and the markets are headed. In conjunction with the  OppenheimerFunds acquisition, we announced a two-year, $1.2 billion stock buyback program, and completed the first $300 million stock repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
           Although the markets are expected to remain volatile in 2019,  Invesco continues to focus on developing an elite set of capabilities aligned to clients evolving needs. Our comprehensive range of investment capabilities has been built over many years to help clients weather various market cycles, and we  believe the firm is better positioned than ever to provide the expert advice and key outcomes that will help clients navigate the challenging markets ahead.   Investing in the future of our business In late 2017 and throughout 2018, we  made several long-term investments that are intended to help us to better meet client needs, further strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term.   The most significant of these commitments is our planned acquisition of MassMutuals asset  management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will accelerate Invescos growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment capabilities.  We will also be better positioned to deliver strong outcomes for clients, since overall performance rankings for US mutual funds are consistently stronger for the combined firm than for either firm independently.5 Substantial synergies make the transaction materially accretive to earnings and will help us improve shareholder returns in both the short and long term.

     The Board of Directors has been an active and engaged supporter of each of these initiatives and is highly supportive of the executive  management team. We're confident that the investments made over the past year will materially improve Invesco's competitive position and help ensure the firm's long-term growth and success. Furthermore, the Board believes that these  moves will drive improvements in long-term share value. We think that the market has not yet absorbed the long-term advantages that we believe will be achieved by these moves.   At the same time, the Board recognizes that shareholders have been affected by the combination of  external forces and the short-term impact of several long-term investments that were made in 2018. Consistent with our practices and in view of the short-term impact to shareholders, we've aligned compensation among our executive team with the  performance of the firm, the details of which can be viewed in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section of this document.   Notwithstanding the results of an exceptionally volatile and challenging period in the markets, the Board remains highly confident in the leadership, strategy and  direction of the firm. The investments we made in 2018 and will continue to make in 2019 are entirely focused on placing Invesco in the best position to meet client needs, compete in a dynamic operating environment and provide compelling returns for  shareholders. We look forward to continuing to help our clients achieve their investment objectives regardless of where the markets take us, which will help us deliver a high level of value to our shareholders over the long term.

     Throughout 2018 we made solid progress in several areas of our multi-year strategic objectives that will help us better meet client needs, further  strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term. The most significant achievement during the year was our announced acquisition of MassMutual's asset management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds, which is anticipated  to close in the second quarter of 2019. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will help accelerate Invesco's growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment  capabilities.

     ∎  Key investment capabilities that had helped  produce nine consecutive years of positive net flows for the firm through 2017 underperformed materially in 2018, contributing to significant negative net flows in 2018. Net flows, positive or negative, are a key driver of short-term shareholder  returns for traditional asset managers. ∎  For much of 2018, we  opted to use our cash and credit resources to fund long-term investments to strengthen our business instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. ∎  Invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of  our peers. As one of the leading investment managers in the UK and Europe, we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Additionally, our strong position in Asia Pacific meant that Invesco was more affected than others by  market uncertainties over the trade issues between China and the US. We believe these factors led to additional negative sentiment on Invesco among investors in our shares.

They validated the disciplined approach of our compensation programs that utilize multiple performance measures, ∎  While none of these shareholders advocated that we make  significant changes to our executive compensation program, they identified opportunities to meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of the pay-for-performance component of our executive compensation program by providing greater rigor with respect to  our performance-based awards and adding a second performance measure, ∎   We provided for greater alignment of executive compensation with  relative shareholder returns, and ∎   We provided more  transparency regarding our compensation program and pay outcomes.   Set forth below are the  enhancements to our executive compensation program.

       Denis Kessler Denis Kessler has served as a non-executive director of our company since 2002. Mr. Kessler is Chairman and chief executive officer of SCOR SE. Prior to joining SCOR, Mr. Kessler was Chairman of the French Insurance Federation, senior  executive vice president and member of the executive committee of the AXA Group and executive vice chairman of the French Business Confederation. Mr. Kessler previously served as a member of the supervisory board of Yam Invest N.V. from 2008  until 2014, a privately-held company. Mr. Kessler is a professor with advanced degrees in economics and social sciences, and a Fellow of the French Institute of Actuaries. He holds a PhD in economics and is a graduate of Ecole des Hautes Etudes  Commerciales (HEC Paris). He holds honorary degrees from the Moscow Academy of Finance and the University of Montreal.   While Mr. Kessler is currently the CEO and Chairperson of a public company and serves as an outside director of two public companies (Invesco and BNP Paribas), he  has demonstrated a continued commitment to Invesco, which is reflected, in part, by his attendance at all but one of Invesco's Board of Director's meetings and all but one of the Board's Committees' meetings during 2018.  Mr. Kessler's unique perspective, fueled by his experience as an economist, his diverse international business experience and current position with a major global reinsurance company, significantly enhances the skill set of our Board of  Directors by providing, among other things, valuable insight into both the investment management industry's macro-economic positioning over the long term across multi-geographies as well as our company's particular challenges within that  industry. The fact that his current position and experience is in a similar industry as the company, combined with his 17 years of service on our Board, allows Mr. Kessler to quickly achieve a sophisticated understanding of the issues to be  addressed by the company and its industry.

    ∎  The compensation committee considers  multiple performance metrics in establishing the company-wide annual incentive pool each year, so no one metric creates an undue reward that might encourage excessive risk taking. The Committee does not attempt to rank or assign relative weight to  any factor, but instead applies its judgment in considering them in their entirety; 
    ∎  The vast majority of investment  professional bonus plans have multi-year measurement periods, caps on earnings and discretionary components; 
    ∎  Sales and commission plans generally  contain multiple performance measures and discretionary elements; and

      We believe in the power of  diversity 
    At Invesco, we're committed to improving diversity at all levels and in all functions across our global business. Although diversity is very  country and culturally specific, the need for greater gender diversity is a constant across the globe, which is why we are focusing on gender at the enterprise level. Today we have a diverse, talented pool of women across our global firm, but we  aspire to have more women at senior levels and across all functions within our firm. 
    ∎ We are supportive of this initiative and will apply  the initiative to Invesco globally with the CEO and each senior managing director responsible and accountable for gender diversity and inclusion; 
    ∎ Globally, we have set a target for female  representation of senior managers to be between 30% - 40% by 2020 (27% as of December 31, 2018); 
    ∎ We will share high-level diversity and inclusion  activities that will aid our achievement of the target and support having greater diversity across the globe; and 
    ∎ Goals on gender diversity will be included for our  CEO and the senior managing directors, as part of their overall performance goals, and to be in support of gender diversity and inclusion activities.

       Invesco 2018  performance Throughout 2018, we made solid progress in several areas of our multi-year strategic objectives that will help us better meet client needs, further  strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term. The most significant achievement during the year was our announced acquisition of MassMutuals asset management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds, which is anticipated  to close in the second quarter of 2019. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will help accelerate Invescos growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment  capabilities.   At the same time, 2018 was a challenging year for the asset management industry  and for Invesco. We saw volatile markets throughout the year and particularly during the fourth quarter. The volatility in the markets impacted financial performance across the industry, particularly for global investment managers like Invesco.  Shareholder returns for traditional asset managers as a group were down 26%,1 while Invesco was down 54% for the year.2 We believe the  underperformance of Invescos stock price relative to our peer group reflects the following factors: ∎  Key investment capabilities that had helped produce nine consecutive years of positive net flows for the firm through 2017 underperformed materially in 2018, contributing to significant  negative net flows in 2018. Net flows, positive or negative, are a key driver of short-term shareholder returns for traditional asset managers. ∎  For much of 2018, we opted to use our cash and credit resources  to fund long-term investments to strengthen our business instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. ∎  Invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of  our peers. As one of the leading investment managers in the UK and Europe, we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Additionally, our strong position in Asia Pacific meant that Invesco was more affected than others by  market uncertainties over the trade issues between China and the US. We believe these factors led to additional negative sentiment on Invesco among investors in our shares.

Shareholder returns for traditional asset managers as a group were down 26%,1 while Invesco was down 54% for the year.2 We believe the  underperformance of Invescos stock price relative to our peer group reflects the following factors: ∎  Key investment capabilities that had helped produce nine consecutive years of positive net flows for the firm through 2017 underperformed materially in 2018, contributing to significant  negative net flows in 2018. Net flows, positive or negative, are a key driver of short-term shareholder returns for traditional asset managers. ∎  For much of 2018, we opted to use our cash and credit resources  to fund long-term investments to strengthen our business instead of conducting stock buybacks that may have provided greater near-term support for the firms stock price. ∎  Invesco has a larger global presence in key markets than most of  our peers. As one of the leading investment managers in the UK and Europe, we were more impacted by continuing uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Additionally, our strong position in Asia Pacific meant that Invesco was more affected than others by  market uncertainties over the trade issues between China and the US. We believe these factors led to additional negative sentiment on Invesco among investors in our shares.   
       Invesco 2018  performance Throughout 2018, we made solid progress in several areas of our multi-year strategic objectives that will help us better meet client needs, further  strengthen our global business and increase shareholder value over the long term. The most significant achievement during the year was our announced acquisition of MassMutuals asset management affiliate, OppenheimerFunds, which is anticipated  to close in the second quarter of 2019. The combination with OppenheimerFunds will help accelerate Invescos growth initiatives, increase our scale and client relevance, and expand our comprehensive suite of differentiated investment  capabilities.

     Emphasis on deferrals The  committee has designed our executive compensation program so a significant portion of an executives compensation is in the form of deferred incentives. The committee believes this appropriately aligns our executives interests with our  shareholders as it focuses on long-term shareholder value creation.   Approximately, 60% - 69%  of incentive compensation of our CEO and each of our senior managing directors is deferred. The committee has no pre-established policy or target on the compensation mix between pay elements.        Performance-based equity awards Fifty  percent of the combined value of the annual deferral award and the long-term equity award is performance-based. New for 2018 awards to be granted in February 2019, the committee approved the following two performance measures  adjusted  operating margin (current) and Relative TSR (new) over a three-year period.   The committee believes tying vesting to adjusted operating margin and relative TSR over a multi-year period aligns with shareholder interests and the following goals  with respect to performance-based awards:    Relative TSR ∎ tracks value created for shareholders as a quantitative measure ∎ aligns with shareholder interests   Adjusted operating margin (AOM) ∎ focuses discipline in corporate investments, initiatives and capital  allocation ∎ is consistent with the way the business is managed ∎ is an important measure of overall strength of an asset manager ∎ aligns with Invescos shareholder value framework ∎ is a primary measure of focus of industry analysts ∎ is improved through effective management over the long term ∎ more effectively avoids conflicts of interest with  clients

The committee believes tying vesting to adjusted operating margin and relative TSR over a multi-year period aligns with shareholder interests and the following goals  with respect to performance-based awards:    Relative TSR ∎ tracks value created for shareholders as a quantitative measure ∎ aligns with shareholder interests   Adjusted operating margin (AOM) ∎ focuses discipline in corporate investments, initiatives and capital  allocation ∎ is consistent with the way the business is managed ∎ is an important measure of overall strength of an asset manager ∎ aligns with Invescos shareholder value framework ∎ is a primary measure of focus of industry analysts ∎ is improved through effective management over the long term ∎ more effectively avoids conflicts of interest with  clients 
     Emphasis on deferrals The  committee has designed our executive compensation program so a significant portion of an executives compensation is in the form of deferred incentives.

   Performance award vesting matrix       
    In response to shareholder feedback, the committee added a second performance measure for performance-based equity awards. The number of  shares that vest will equal the target amount multiplied by the vesting percentage associated with the Average AOM and Relative TSR ranking on the chart below. Vesting to range from 0% to 150%. We believe that the linked vesting performance  thresholds adds to the significant rigor of our incentive program as payouts are not a range of outcomes but represent specific performance levels.   The company's adjusted operating margin for 2018 was 36.5% and its Relative TSR was in the bottom quartile. Applying the 2018 performance results on a three-year  average basis would result in a vesting percentage of 33% in respect to the 2018 performance-based awards – a meaningful impact on the compensation outcomes for our NEOs.

    Determining NEO compensation Below is our "4-step" timeline that describes the committee's year-long compensation responsibilities and process  for determining executive compensation, including individual NEO compensation. In making compensation decisions, the committee makes a quantitative assessment of company performance (as described on pages  35-36) and a qualitative assessment of individual performance. As noted, the committee reviews firm and peer financial data as well as progress against our annual operating plan. The committee's  philosophy demonstrates alignment with our executive compensation outcomes and our annual financial performance and multi-year strategic objectives. See NEO Compensation and Performance Summaries starting on page 48 for a description of NEO  achievements in the context of quantitative company performance.

1  For each of the named executive officers, includes salary that was eligible for deferral, at the election of the named  executive officer, under our 401(k) plan or similar plan in the named executive officer's country. For each of the named executive officers, salary is unchanged from 2017.  
   For Messrs. Lo and Taylor, base salary is converted to U.S. dollars using an average annual exchange rate, which accounts  for the different salary amounts shown despite the fact neither has experienced a salary change during the period shown.  
2  For share awards granted in 2018, includes (i) time-based equity awards that generally vest in four equal annual  installments on each anniversary of the date of grant; and (ii) performance-based awards, which are subject to a three-year performance period (2018-2020) and vest on February 28, 2021; except that, with respect to Mr. Taylor, the  performance-based equity award is subject to a 33-month performance period (January 1, 2018 - September 30, 2020) and vests on December 15, 2020. The value of performance-based awards is based on the  grant date value and reflects the probable outcome of such conditions and represents the target level (100%) of achievement. See Grants of plan-based share awards for 2018 below for information about the number of shares underlying each of  the time-based equity awards.  
   Grant date fair values were calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards  Codification Topic 718 "Compensation – Stock Compensation" ("ACS 718"). The grant date fair value was calculated by multiplying the target number of shares granted by the closing price of the company's common shares on  the date of grant. The amounts disclosed do not reflect the value actually realized by the named executive officers. For additional information, please see Note 11 – "Share-Based Compensation" to the financial statements in our 2018  Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2  Time-based equity awards. For each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Taylor, time-based equity  awards are four-year awards that vest 25% each year on the anniversary of the date of grant. With respect to Mr. Taylor, time-based equity awards are comprised of (i) a 3-year award that vests  ratably on the first and second anniversary of the grant date and on December 15 of the second calendar year after the grant date and (ii) a 4-year award that vests 100% on the fourth anniversary of  the date of grant.

   Performance-based equity awards. For each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Taylor,  performance-based equity awards are subject to a three-year performance period (2018-2020) and vest on February 28, 2021. With respect to Mr. Taylor, the performance-based equity award is subject to a  33-month performance period (January 1, 2018 - September 30, 2020) and vests on December 15, 2020.  
3  Performance-based equity awards are tied to the achievement of specified levels of adjusted operating margin. Vesting  ranges from 0 to 150%; straight line interpolation to be used for actual results. Dividend equivalents are deferred for such performance-based equity awards and will be paid at the same rate as on our shares if and to the extent an award vests. The  threshold, target and maximum financial measures for the performance-based equity awards granted in 2018 are illustrated below.

   It should be noted that beginning in 2019, performance-based awards will have the following two performance measures:  adjusted operating margin and relative TSR. See Performance-based equity awards above.  
4  Dividends and dividend equivalents on unvested time-based equity awards are paid at the same time and rate as on our  shares.  
5  The grant date fair value is the total amount that the company will recognize as expense under applicable accounting  requirements if the share awards fully vest. This amount is included in our Summary Compensation Table each year. Grant date fair values were calculated in accordance with ASC 718. The grant date fair value is calculated by multiplying the number of  shares granted by the closing price of our common shares on the day the award was granted. With respect to the performance-based equity awards, the grant date fair value also represents the probable outcome of such performance conditions and  represents the target (100%) level of achievement.

          Proposal     3       Amendment of Company's Third Amended and Restated Bye-Laws to Eliminate  Certain Super Majority Voting Standards   
         General 
       ∎ Modification of Rights. Our Bye-Laws currently provide that modifying the rights of a class of shares requires the approval of not less than three-quarters of the issued shares of the applicable class. 
       ∎ Certain Business  Combinations. Our Bye-Laws currently provide that certain business combinations with interested shareholders require, among other things, the approval of  two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder. 
       ∎ Bye-Law Amendments. Our Bye-Laws currently require the approval of not less than three-quarters of the outstanding voting power to amend certain provisions of the Bye-Laws, including with respect to the size of the board, board tenure, shareholder proposals, proxy access, removal of directors, board vacancies, written resolutions, rights of shares, certain business  combinations and Bye-Law amendments. 
       ∎ Actions with Respect to  Directors. Our Bye-Laws currently require that a majority of our outstanding voting shares approve the removal of directors for cause and approve the filling of vacancies resulting from such  removal. 
       ∎ Modification of Rights.  The proposed amended Bye-Laws would provide that modification of the rights of (1) common shares requires approval by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common shares and (2) preference  shares requires approval by two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the applicable class of preference shares (or such lower threshold as may be set forth in the instrument defining the rights of the  applicable class of preference shares). 
       ∎ Certain Business  Combinations. The proposed amended Bye-Laws would require a majority of the votes cast by holders of shares not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder for approving certain business combinations  with interested shareholders. 
       ∎ Bye-Law Amendments and Actions with Respect to Directors. The proposed amended Bye-Laws would require a majority of the votes cast to approve Bye-Law amendments (other than certain amendments relating to the preference share provisions addressed above, which would utilize the same standard applicable to modifying the rights of preference shares), removal  of directors for cause and filling vacancies resulting from the removal of such directors.

          Proposal     4       To amend the Invesco Ltd. 2016 Global Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Equity Plan") to increase the number of  shares authorized for issuance under the plan   
          Proposal     4       To amend the Invesco Ltd. 2016 Global Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Equity Plan") to increase the number of  shares authorized for issuance under the plan   
          Proposal     4       To amend the Invesco Ltd. 2016 Global Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Equity Plan") to increase the number of  shares authorized for issuance under the plan   
         General 
       ∎ Equity compensation  facilitates alignment of employee and shareholder interests. Consistent with industry practice and accepted good governance standards, a significant portion of compensation for our executive officers is delivered in the form of company equity.  Further, our compensation philosophy reflects our belief that equity compensation is a critical means of aligning the interests of employees with those of our shareholders. In recent years, all equity awards have been made in the form of restricted  stock and restricted stock units that generally vest over a four-year period. We believe that this is the best and simplest way to align the interests of our employees with the interests of our shareholders, giving our employees a significant  incentive to appropriately increase shareholder value. 
       ∎ Equity compensation is an important tool to  recruit and retain talent. Our competitors in the industry routinely use equity awards to compensate employees, and we believe that employees place a high value on equity compensation. Our equity compensation awards are an important component of  our compensation program and play a significant role in our ability to attract and retain talented employees and senior management. Approximately 28% of our employee population hold equity awards. 
       ∎ Use of  full-value awards. Our equity compensation program favors the use of full-value awards (as opposed to appreciation awards, such as stock options or stock appreciation rights). This can mitigate the potential  dilutive effect of equity compensation, because the same value can be delivered in the form of a stock award using fewer shares than would be needed if delivered in the form of a stock option. Invesco has not granted employee stock options since  2005 and has never granted stock appreciation rights. 
       ∎ The 2016 Equity Plan has key features that serve  shareholder interests. The 2016 Equity Plan includes best practices with respect to governance and administration of equity compensation programs described in more detail below in below Key Features.

    Impact on dilution The 2016 Equity Plan currently authorizes  the issuance of up to 21.7 million shares. As noted above, the 2016 Equity Plan Amendment will approve an additional 9.7 million shares. If the 2016 Equity Plan Amendment is approved by our shareholders, the 2016 Equity Plan will authorize the  issuance of 31.4 million shares of which 15.4 million shares will be available for grant. The Board believes that the potential dilution resulting from these additional shares is reasonable and that the issuance of these additional shares will  provide an appropriate incentive for employees to increase the value of the company for shareholders. Based on historical grant levels and the company's current stock price, the company anticipates that the shares available for grant under the  2016 Equity Plan after the 2016 Equity Plan Amendment becomes effective will be sufficient to provide projected equity incentives to our employees until our 2020 Annual General Meeting.

    ∎ The award is forfeited, canceled or terminates,  expires or lapses without shares having been delivered; 
    ∎ The award is settled in cash; or 
    ∎ The shares are withheld by the company to satisfy  all or part of any tax withholding obligation related to an award of restricted stock or restricted stock units. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    ∎ Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.  Awards of restricted stock are actual shares of common stock that are issued to a participant. An award of a restricted stock unit represents the right to receive cash or common stock at a future date. In each case, the award is subject to  restrictions on transferability and such other restrictions, if any, as the compensation committee may impose at the date of grant. The restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstances, including, without  limitation, a specified period of employment or the satisfaction of pre-established performance goals, in such installments, or otherwise, as the compensation committee may determine. Except to the extent  provided in the applicable award agreement, a participant granted restricted stock will have all of the rights of a shareholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote and the right to receive dividends. If provided in the applicable award  agreement, a holder of restricted stock units will be entitled to dividend equivalents with respect to such restricted stock units. 
    Upon termination of employment or other service relationship during the applicable restriction period, shares of restricted stock  and restricted stock units that are subject to restrictions will be forfeited unless the award agreement provides otherwise. 
    ∎ Other stock-based awards. The 2016 Equity  Plan provides for the award of company shares and other awards that are valued by reference to our shares. Other stock-based awards may only be granted in lieu of compensation that would otherwise be payable to the participant. Non-executive director awards are considered a form of other stock-based awards. Each year, the committee establishes the value of such stock-based awards for non-executive  directors for the upcoming year. Such awards are subject to the non-executive director stock ownership policy. 
    ∎ Stock options and SARs. A stock option is an  award that gives the participant the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified number of company shares at a specified price for a stated period of time. Stock options may be granted in the form of incentive stock options, which are  intended to qualify for favorable treatment for the recipient under U.S. federal tax law, or as nonqualified stock options, which do not qualify for this favorable tax treatment. SARs represent the right to receive an amount in cash, shares or both  equal to the fair market value of the shares subject to the award on the date of exercise minus the exercise price of the award. 
    ∎ No discounted stock options or SARs   All stock options and SARs must have an exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. 
    ∎ No reloads  The grant of a stock  option will not be conditioned on the delivery of shares to the company in payment of an exercise price or satisfaction of a withholding or other payment obligation (i.e., a reload option). 
    ∎ No repricing  Repricing of stock  options or SARs is not permitted without shareholder approval. 
    ∎ Term  The term of a stock option or  SAR cannot exceed 10 years. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    ∎ No liberal share recycling  Share  recycling for stock options and SARs is prohibited. 
    ∎ Minimum vesting requirements  The 2016  Equity Plan provides a minimum vesting period of one year for stock options and SARs. 
      Minimum vesting requirements Restricted stock and restricted stock units. Except with respect to the death, disability or involuntary termination (other than for cause or unsatisfactory  performance) of a participant or the occurrence of a corporate transaction (including a change of control) or special circumstances determined by the committee, an award of restricted stock or restricted stock units subject solely to continued  services shall have a minimum vesting period of not less than two years from the date of grant (permitting pro rata vesting over such time). In recent years, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units generally vest over a four-year period.  Our executive officers' performance-based equity awards are subject to 3-year cliff vesting.

 All audit and non-audit services provided to the company and its subsidiaries by PwC during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were either specifically approved or pre- approved under  the audit and non-audit services pre- approval policy.   The audit committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by our independent auditors. The  policy is designed to ensure that the auditor's independence is not impaired. The policy sets forth the audit committee's views on audit, audit-related, tax and other services. It provides that, before the company engages the independent  auditor to render any service, the engagement must either be specifically approved by the audit committee or fall into one of the defined categories that have been pre-approved. The policy defines the services  that the committee has pre-approved. The term of any such categorical approval is from the date of pre-approval to the next annual update of such pre-approval, unless the committee specifically provides otherwise. The policy also prohibits the company from engaging the auditors to provide certain defined non-audit  services that are prohibited under SEC rules. Under the policy, the audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members, but may not delegate such authority to the company's  management. Under the policy, our management must inform the audit committee of each service performed by our independent auditor pursuant to the policy. This requirement normally is satisfied by a report issued to the audit committee from the  independent auditor. Requests to the audit committee for separate approval must be submitted by both the independent auditor and our chief financial officer and the request must include a joint statement as to whether it is deemed consistent with  the SEC's and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's rules on auditor independence.

    ∎ If your Invesco shares are held in a bank or  brokerage account, contact your bank or broker to obtain a written legal proxy in order to vote your shares at the meeting. If you do not obtain a legal proxy from your bank or broker, you will not be entitled to vote your shares, but you can still  attend the Annual General Meeting if you bring a recent bank or brokerage statement showing that you owned Invesco common shares on March 11, 2019. You should report to the check-in area for admission to  the Annual General Meeting. 
    ∎ Via the internet: You can submit a proxy via  the Internet until 11:59 a.m. eastern time on May 8, 2019, by accessing the web site at http://www.envisonreports.com/IVZ and following the instructions you will find on the web site. Internet proxy submission is available 24 hours a day. You  will be given the opportunity to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. 
    ∎ By telephone: You can  submit a proxy by telephone until 11:59 a.m. eastern time on May 8, 2019, by calling toll-free 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) (from  the U.S. and Canada) and following the instructions.

    ∎ Shareholders of record.  If you are the shareholder of record and you do not vote in person at the Annual General Meeting, or by proxy via the Internet, by telephone, or by mail, your shares will not be voted at the Annual General Meeting. 
    ∎ Beneficial owners. If you are the beneficial  owner of your shares, your broker or nominee may vote your shares only on those proposals on which it has discretion to vote. Under NYSE rules, your broker or nominee has discretion to vote your shares on routine matters, such as Proposal  No. 5, but does not have discretion to vote your shares on non-routine matters, such as Proposals No. 1, 2, 3 or 4. Therefore, if you do not instruct your broker as to how to vote your shares on  Proposals No. 1, 2, 3 or 4, this would be a broker non-vote, and your shares would not be counted as having been voted on the applicable proposal. We therefore strongly encourage you  to instruct your broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.  
    ∎ Shareholders of record.  If you are a shareholder of record and you submit a proxy, but you do not provide voting instructions, all of your shares will be voted FOR Proposals No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
    ∎ Beneficial owners. If  you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the broker or other nominee that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or other nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under  NYSE rules, brokers and other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters, such as Proposal No. 5, but do not have discretion to vote on non-routine matters, such as Proposals No. 1, 2, 3  and 4. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, your broker or other nominee may only vote your shares on Proposal No. 5 and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual  General Meeting.

 U.S. GAAP rules on consolidation require the company to consolidate certain investment product assets and liabilities which significantly distort our balance sheet and associated financial metrics.       Schedule of Non-GAAP information We utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield  on AUM), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). The company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the  company's ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. These measures also assist the company's management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and  management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income  attributable to Invesco Ltd. and diluted EPS.

1  Invesco Great Wall: Prior to the third quarter 2018, management reflected its interests in Great Wall Fund  Management Company ("Invesco Great Wall") on a proportional consolidation basis, which was consistent with the presentation of our share of the AUM from these investments. Given the company's influence on Invesco Great Wall, a change  in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership, and reaching agreement in principle in the third quarter of 2018 to obtain a majority stake of the joint venture, the company began reporting 100% of the flows and AUM for Invesco Great Wall. Also  beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the company's non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income is  reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.  
2  Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses: Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses  include renewal commissions and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. While the  terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party  arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP.  
       Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses  from operating revenues appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company's managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by  geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair  comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco's own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This  financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company's performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation  purposes.  
3  CIP: See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 - "Consolidated Investment  Products" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019 for a detailed analysis of the impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the  consolidation of CIP. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S.  GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income.  
        Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's  analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations  and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income  and adjusted net income.

4  Transaction, integration and restructuring related adjustments: Management believes it is useful to investors and  other users of our Consolidated Financial Statements to adjust for the transaction, integration and restructuring charges in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of  our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges. See "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 compared to  December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 – Transaction, Integration and Restructuring" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2018  filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019 for additional details.  
5  Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities: Certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to  the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically managed by the company. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through a total return swap financial  instrument. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the  investment and financial instrument appreciation (depreciation) are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain  or loss impacting net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences  impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments.  
       Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset  ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS) to produce results  that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period.  
       Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation  plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company's Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the  company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.

  a.  General and administrative expenses for 2015 include a provision of $12.6 million pertaining to regulatory actions  and related legal fees of $0.5 million (2018: none; 2017: none; 2016: $1.0 million). This includes $7.6 million associated with our private equity business.  
         Operating expenses for 2014 include a charge of $31.1 million (in respect of the penalty  under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pertaining to the company's compliance with certain FCA rules and regulations for the period from May 2008 to November 2012).   
  b.  As a result of an increase in our recoverable VAT from applying additional regulatory guidance, a credit was recorded in  the third quarter of 2018. The portion of the cumulative adjustment representing 2014 through 2017 has been removed for non-GAAP purposes.  
  c.  Operating expenses for 2017 reflect the cost of multiple senior executive retirements, including, among others, the former  Senior Managing Director of EMEA and the Chairman of our Private Equity business, which resulted in expenses of $19.7 million related to accelerated vesting of deferred compensation and other separation costs. The number of senior executive  retirements and magnitude of their retirement costs incurred in one quarter was unprecedented for Invesco. The company deemed it appropriate to adjust these costs from U.S. GAAP total compensation expenses in an effort to isolate and evaluate our  level of ongoing compensation expenses and to allow for more appropriate comparisons to internal metrics and with the level of compensation expenses incurred by industry peers.  
  d.  General and administrative expenses for 2014 and 2015 include charges of $31.1 million and $4.7 million,  respectively, in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management  fees.  
  e.  Included within general and administrative expenses for 2014 is a credit of $4.7 million related to the partial  refund of a $15.3 million levy in 2010 from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  
  f.  Included within other gains and losses, net is the  mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar and  the Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign exchange rates. The Pound Sterling contracts provide coverage through June 29, 2019 and the Euro contracts provided coverage through December 27, 2017. The adjustment from U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-GAAP results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the  contract period.  
  g.  Employee benefit plan termination: Operating expenses for 2016 include an incremental credit of $8.6 million related  to an employee benefit plan termination.  
  h.  During 2015, the company acquired investment management contracts from Deutsche Bank and the purchase price was solely  comprised of contingent consideration payable in future periods. Adjustment represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  i.  Other gains and losses for 2017 includes a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of Euros held in the  U.K. in anticipation of payment for the European ETF business acquisition.  
  j.  Other-than-temporary impairment includes an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2016 that is related to the  acquisition of Invesco Asset Management (India) Private Limited.  
  k.  The income tax provision for 2017 includes a retroactive state tax expense of $12.2 million related to 2016 and prior  open tax years caused by changes in state tax regulations. 2017 also included a $130.7 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 Tax Act enacted in the United States.   
7  Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues.  
8  Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.  
9  The effective tax rate on adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is 27.0% (2016: 26.8%; 2015: 27.1%; 2014:  26.6%; 2013: 26.3%).  
10  Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. divided by the weighted average number  of common and restricted shares outstanding. There is no difference between the calculated earnings per share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per share amounts under the two class method.

[BEGIN TABLE]
    may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Bye-Law 10(3)  (such greater number, the "Permitted Number"); provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by: 
    (1)  the number of directors in office that will be included in the Companys proxy  materials with respect to such annual general meeting for whom access to the Companys proxy materials was previously provided pursuant to this Bye-Law 10(3), other than any such director who at  the time of such annual general meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) successive annual terms; and 
    (2)  the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be  included in the Companys proxy materials with respect to such annual general meeting as an unopposed (by the Company) nominee pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a Shareholder or group of Shareholders (other than  any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such Shareholder or group of Shareholders, directly from the Company), other than any such director referred to in this clause  (2) who at the time of such annual general meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) successive annual terms; 
        provided, further, that in the event the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the  size of the Board of Directors effective on or prior to the date of the annual general meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. An Eligible Shareholder submitting more than one  Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Companys proxy statement pursuant to this paragraph (C) of this Bye-Law 10(3) shall rank such Shareholder Nominees based on the order that the  Eligible Shareholder desires such Shareholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Companys proxy statement and include such specified rank in its Proxy Access Notice. If the number of Shareholder Nominees pursuant to this paragraph  (C) of this Bye-Law 10(3) for an annual general meeting of Shareholders exceeds the Permitted Number, then the highest ranking qualifying Shareholder Nominee from each Eligible Shareholder will be  selected by the Company for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the ownership position as disclosed in each Eligible Shareholders Proxy Access Notice. If  the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Shareholder Nominee from each Eligible Shareholder has been selected, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the  Permitted Number is reached. 
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Bye-Law 10(3), the Company shall not be required to include any Shareholder Nominees in its proxy materials pursuant to this Bye-Law 10(3) for any meeting of  Shareholders for which the Secretary of the Company receives notice (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) that a Shareholder intends to nominate one or more persons for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to the advance notice requirements  for Shareholder nominees set forth in Bye-Law 10(1). 
    (D)  An Eligible Shareholder is one or more Shareholders of record who own and have  owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned, in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the Company pursuant to this Bye-Law 10(3), and as of the record date for determining Shareholders eligible to vote at the annual general meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the  Proxy Access Request Required Shares), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the Company and the date of the applicable annual general  meeting, provided that the aggregate number of Shareholders (and, if and to the extent that a Shareholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners) whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying  the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20).

    (2) The demand for a poll may, before the poll is taken, be withdrawn but only with the consent of the  chairman and a demand so withdrawn shall not be taken to have invalidated the result of a show of hands or count of votes received as electronic records declared before the demand was made. If the demand for a poll is withdrawn, the chairman or any  other Shareholder entitled may demand a poll. 
    (3) Unless a poll is so demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a  resolution has, on a show of hands or count of votes received as electronic records, been carried or carried unanimously or by a particular majority or not carried by a particular majority or lost shall be final and conclusive, and an entry to that  effect in the minute book of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of votes recorded for or against such resolution.

    (10) At the conclusion of any poll, the ballot papers shall be examined and counted by a committee of  one or more inspectors appointed by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company prior to the general meeting to act at such meeting as provided hereunder and to make a written report thereof. If no inspector (or any alternate previously  designated by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer) is able to act at the meeting, the chairperson of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her  duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.

The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls during the meeting for each matter upon which the Shareholders will vote by poll at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxy or vote, nor  any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of (i) the proxies, any  envelopes submitted therewith, any information provided by a Shareholder who submits a proxy by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the proxy was authorized by the Shareholder and (ii) the  ballots and (iii) the regular books and records of the Company 
        In addition, the inspectors may also consider other reliable information for the  limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar Persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the  Shareholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider such other reliable information for such purpose, they shall, at the time they make their certification, specify the precise information considered by them, including the Person or Persons from  whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

    (1) At any general meeting if an amendment shall be proposed to any resolution under consideration and  the chairperson of the meeting shall rule on whether the proposed amendment is out of order, the proceedings on the substantive resolution shall not be invalidated by any error in such ruling. 
    (2) At any general meeting a declaration by the chairperson of the meeting that a question proposed for  consideration has been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in a book containing the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact. 
    40.  Instrument of proxy 
    (1) Every Shareholder entitled to vote has the right to do so either in person or by one or more  persons authorized by a proxy executed and delivered in accordance with these Bye-Laws. 
    (2) A person so authorized as a proxy shall be entitled to exercise the same power on behalf of the  grantor of the proxy as the grantor could exercise at a general meeting of the Company. 
    (3) No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer  period. A proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. 
    (4) Subject to paragraph (3) of this Bye-Law 40, the instrument appointing a proxy, together  with such other evidence as to its due execution as the Board may from time to time require, shall be delivered at the registered office of the Company (or at such place or places as may be specified in the notice convening the meeting or in any  notice of any adjournment or, in either case, in any document sent therewith) prior to the holding of the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting at which the individual named in the instrument proposes to vote and, if not so delivered, the instrument  of proxy shall not be treated as valid. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (5) Instruments of proxy shall be in such form as the Board may approve (including, without limitation,  written or electronic form) and the Board may, if it thinks fit, send out with the notice of any meeting forms of instruments of proxy for use at the meeting. The instrument of proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to vote on any amendment of a  resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it  relates. 
    (6) A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding  the death or unsoundness of mind of the principal subsequent to giving the proxy but before the vote or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of the authority under which it was executed. 
    (7) The decision of the chairperson of any general meeting as to the validity of any appointment of a  proxy shall be final.

    (3) Any sum that, by the terms of allotment of a share, becomes payable upon issue or at any fixed  date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall for all of the purposes of these Bye-Laws be deemed to be a call duly made and payable, on the date on which, by the terms  of issue, the same becomes payable and, in case of non-payment, all of the relevant provisions of these Bye-Laws as to payment of interest, costs, charges and expenses,  forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 
    (4) The Company may accept from any Shareholder the whole or a part of the amount remaining unpaid on  any shares held by him, although no part of that amount has been called up.

    (1) If any Shareholder fails to pay, on the day appointed for payment thereof, any call in respect of  any share allotted to or held by such Shareholder, the Board may, at any time thereafter during such time as the call remains unpaid, direct the Secretary to forward to such Shareholder a notice in the form (or as near thereto as circumstances  admit) set forth in Schedule A hereto. 
    (2) If the requirements of such notice are not complied with, any such share may at any time thereafter  before the payment of such call and the interest due in respect thereof be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to that effect, and such share shall thereupon become the property of the Company and may be disposed of as the Board shall  determine. 
    (3) A Shareholder whose share or shares have been forfeited as aforesaid shall, notwithstanding such  forfeiture, be liable to pay to the Company all calls owing on such share or shares at the time of the forfeiture and all interest due thereon. 
    (4) The Board may accept the surrender of any shares that it is in a position to forfeit on such terms  and conditions as may be agreed. Subject to those terms and conditions, a surrendered share shall be treated as if it has been forfeited.

    (1) The Board may resolve to capitalize any part of the amount for the time being standing to the  credit of any of the Companys share premium or other reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up unissued shares to be allotted as fully paid bonus  shares pro rata to the Shareholders. 
    (2) The Board may from time to time resolve to capitalise all or any part of any amount for the time  being standing to the credit of any reserve or fund which is available for distribution or to the credit of any share premium account and accordingly that such amount be set free for distribution amongst the Shareholders or any class of Shareholders  who would be entitled thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions, on the footing that the same be not paid in cash but be applied either in or towards paying up amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares in the  Company held by such Shareholders respectively or in payment up in full of unissued shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company, to be allotted and distributed credited as fully paid amongst such Shareholders, or partly in one way and  partly in the other, provided that for the purpose of this Bye-Law 65, a share premium account may be applied only in paying up of unissued shares to be issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid. Where any difficulty arises in regard  to any distribution under this Bye-Law 65, the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient and, in particular, may authorise any Person to sell and transfer any fractions or may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be  practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Shareholders in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Board.  The Board may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the Persons entitled to participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the  Shareholders.
